(NASDAQ: JYNT), a national operator, manager, and franchisor of chiropractic clinics, reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights: Q3 2024 Compared to Q3 2023**\n\n  * Grew revenue 2% to $30.2 million.\n  * Reported net loss of $3.2 million, including $3.8 million in loss on disposition or impairment, compared to net loss of $716,000, including loss on disposition or impairment of $905,000.\n  * Reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million.\n  * Increased system-wide sales1 8% to $129.3 million.\n  * Reported system-wide comp sales2 of 4%.\n  * Sold 7 franchise licenses in both Q3 2024 and Q2 2024, compared to 12 in Q3 2023, reflecting the impact of the refranchising process.\n  * Increased the total clinic count to 963 – 838 clinics franchised and 125 clinics company-owned or managed – at September 30, 2024. During Q3 2024, The Joint \n    * Opened 14 franchised clinics;\n    * Refranchised one clinic; and\n    * Closed 11 clinics: three franchised being relocated, three non-traditional corporate units on Airforce bases; as well as three franchised and two company-owned or managed that were underperforming.\n\n\n\n“As the category leader with a premier national brand, attractive asset-light franchise model and approximately 1% share of the $8.5 billion being spent annually out-of-pocket on chiropractic care, The Joint’s long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer headwinds,” said President and Chief Executive Officer of The Joint Corp. Sanjiv Razdan. “To lead The Joint’s next phase of growth, I will leverage my strategic business acumen, branding expertise and extensive experience leading successful multi-site consumer service companies and franchise businesses. The board and I are committed to our refranchising efforts; elevating patient care; ensuring strong clinic economics; strengthening our people, capability and culture; and fueling innovation to drive growth and improve profitability. With the power behind The Joint franchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics, increase patient count, and drive growth will increase profitability and create shareholder value. I am confident we will emerge a stronger company.”\n\n**Financial Results for Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023** Revenue was $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue was $2.8 million, compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the associated higher regional developer royalties and commissions.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses were $4.8 million, compared to $4.3 million, reflecting the timing of advertising spend. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 47% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of corporate clinics that are being held for sale in connection with the refranchising efforts.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.8 million, up from $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLoss on disposition or impairment was $3.8 million, related to the quarterly impairment analysis of clinics held for sale as part of the refranchising efforts, compared to $905,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $63,000, compared to income tax benefit of $188,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss was $3.2 million, including $3.8 million loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.21 loss per share. This compares to net loss of $716,000, including the $905,000 loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.05 loss per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Financial Results for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023** Revenue was $90.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $87.1 million in the same period of 2023. Net loss was $5.8 million, including $5.6 million loss on disposition or impairment and $1.5 million in employee litigation in the second quarter of 2024, or $0.39 loss per share. This compares net income for the first nine months of 2023 of $1.3 million, including the $3.9 million in other income related to the net employee retention credit and $1.1 million of loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.09 earnings per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8.2 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet Liquidity** Unrestricted cash was $20.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2023. Cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 includes $5.3 million from operations and the net proceeds of the sales of clinics offset by ongoing IT capex and the $2.0 million first quarter 2024 repayment of the line of credit to JP Morgan Chase. Through this facility, we have retained immediate access to $20 million through February 2027.\n\n**2024 Guidance** The company adjusted its guidance to account the potential impact of ongoing consumer headwinds.\n\n  * System-wide sales are expected to be between $525 million and $535 million, adjusted from $530 million and $545 million and compared to $488.0 million in 2023.\n  * System-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more are expected to be between 3% and 4% adjusted from in the mid-single digits in 2024 and compared to 4% in 2023.\n  * New franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics, are expected to be between 55 and 60, adjusted from 60 and 75 and compared to 104 in 2023. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call** The Joint Corp. management will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, November 7, 2024, after the market close. Stockholders and interested participants may listen to a live broadcast of the conference call by dialing 1-(833) 630-0823 or (412) 317-1831 and ask to be joined into the ‘The Joint’ call approximately 15 minutes prior to the start time.\n\nThe live webcast of the call with accompanying slide presentation can be accessed in the IR events section [https://ir.thejoint.com/events](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=70_yFlLUIC7PGD5XtDtOsm9Us9jk7nPpplScqLzkQ5f5Wu8p_v7bzKq0gM-qXkCGnyhwKdL2h5ebdbXRoCesos9a0GC5TzELwyK8iPcm5UfMeZfnfVwxRi0AkiLuMK00) and available for approximately one year. An audio archive can be accessed for one week by dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 and entering conference ID 3620356.\n\n**Commonly Discussed Performance Metrics** This release includes a presentation of commonly discussed performance metrics. System-wide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operated by the company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. System-wide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information** This release also includes a presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important measures used by management to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. Reconciliation of historical net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The company defines EBITDA as net income/(loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses (which includes contract termination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), net (gain)/loss on disposition or impairment, stock-based compensation expenses, costs related to restatement filings, restructuring costs, litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related fees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business) and other income related to employee retention credits.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s financial statements filed with the SEC.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Words such as, \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"continues,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"goal,\" \"objectives,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"opportunity,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"near-term,\" \"long-term,\" \"projections,\" \"assumptions,\" \"projects,\" \"guidance,\" \"forecasts,\" \"outlook,\" \"target,\" \"trends,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Specific forward looking statements made in this press release include, among others, our belief that our long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer headwinds; our commitment to our refranchising efforts, elevating patient care, ensuring strong clinic economics, strengthening our people, capability and culture, and fueling innovation to drive growth and improve profitability; our confidence that with the power behind The Joint franchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics, increase patient count and drive growth, we will emerge a stronger company; and our expectations for 2024 system-wide sales, system-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more, and new franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, our inability to identify and recruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our clinics, due in part to the nationwide labor shortage and an increase in operating expenses due to measures we may need to take to address such shortage; inflation, which has increased our costs and which could otherwise negatively impact our business; our failure to profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics; our failure to refranchise as planned; short-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and result in class action lawsuits; our failure to remediate future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence; and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024 and subsequently filed current and quarterly reports. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\n\n**About The Joint Corp.

While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance, because these revenues are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. 2 System-wide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed.\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/13d47e5e-b299-479f-839e-c95ab47926eb/small/tjc-logo-reverse-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/13d47e5e-b299-479f-839e-c95ab47926eb)\n\nSource: The Joint Corp. \n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n"

(NASDAQ: JYNT), a national operator, manager, and franchisor of chiropractic clinics, reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights: Q3 2024 Compared to Q3 2023**\n\n  * Grew revenue 2% to $30.2 million.\n  * Reported net loss of $3.2 million, including $3.8 million in loss on disposition or impairment, compared to net loss of $716,000, including loss on disposition or impairment of $905,000.\n  * Reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million.\n  * Increased system-wide sales1 8% to $129.3 million.\n  * Reported system-wide comp sales2 of 4%.\n  * Sold 7 franchise licenses in both Q3 2024 and Q2 2024, compared to 12 in Q3 2023, reflecting the impact of the refranchising process.\n  * Increased the total clinic count to 963 – 838 clinics franchised and 125 clinics company-owned or managed – at September 30, 2024. During Q3 2024, The Joint \n    * Opened 14 franchised clinics;\n    * Refranchised one clinic; and\n    * Closed 11 clinics: three franchised being relocated, three non-traditional corporate units on Airforce bases; as well as three franchised and two company-owned or managed that were underperforming.\n\n\n\n“As the category leader with a premier national brand, attractive asset-light franchise model and approximately 1% share of the $8.5 billion being spent annually out-of-pocket on chiropractic care, The Joint’s long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer headwinds,” said President and Chief Executive Officer of The Joint Corp. Sanjiv Razdan. “To lead The Joint’s next phase of growth, I will leverage my strategic business acumen, branding expertise and extensive experience leading successful multi-site consumer service companies and franchise businesses. The board and I are committed to our refranchising efforts; elevating patient care; ensuring strong clinic economics; strengthening our people, capability and culture; and fueling innovation to drive growth and improve profitability. With the power behind The Joint franchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics, increase patient count, and drive growth will increase profitability and create shareholder value. I am confident we will emerge a stronger company.”\n\n**Financial Results for Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023** Revenue was $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue was $2.8 million, compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the associated higher regional developer royalties and commissions.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses were $4.8 million, compared to $4.3 million, reflecting the timing of advertising spend. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 47% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of corporate clinics that are being held for sale in connection with the refranchising efforts.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.8 million, up from $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLoss on disposition or impairment was $3.8 million, related to the quarterly impairment analysis of clinics held for sale as part of the refranchising efforts, compared to $905,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $63,000, compared to income tax benefit of $188,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss was $3.2 million, including $3.8 million loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.21 loss per share. This compares to net loss of $716,000, including the $905,000 loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.05 loss per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Financial Results for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023** Revenue was $90.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $87.1 million in the same period of 2023. Net loss was $5.8 million, including $5.6 million loss on disposition or impairment and $1.5 million in employee litigation in the second quarter of 2024, or $0.39 loss per share. This compares net income for the first nine months of 2023 of $1.3 million, including the $3.9 million in other income related to the net employee retention credit and $1.1 million of loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.09 earnings per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8.2 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet Liquidity** Unrestricted cash was $20.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2023. Cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 includes $5.3 million from operations and the net proceeds of the sales of clinics offset by ongoing IT capex and the $2.0 million first quarter 2024 repayment of the line of credit to JP Morgan Chase. Through this facility, we have retained immediate access to $20 million through February 2027.\n\n**2024 Guidance** The company adjusted its guidance to account the potential impact of ongoing consumer headwinds.\n\n  * System-wide sales are expected to be between $525 million and $535 million, adjusted from $530 million and $545 million and compared to $488.0 million in 2023.\n  * System-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more are expected to be between 3% and 4% adjusted from in the mid-single digits in 2024 and compared to 4% in 2023.\n  * New franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics, are expected to be between 55 and 60, adjusted from 60 and 75 and compared to 104 in 2023. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call** The Joint Corp. management will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, November 7, 2024, after the market close.

An audio archive can be accessed for one week by dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 and entering conference ID 3620356.\n\n**Commonly Discussed Performance Metrics** This release includes a presentation of commonly discussed performance metrics. System-wide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operated by the company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. System-wide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information** This release also includes a presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important measures used by management to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. Reconciliation of historical net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The company defines EBITDA as net income/(loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses (which includes contract termination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), net (gain)/loss on disposition or impairment, stock-based compensation expenses, costs related to restatement filings, restructuring costs, litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related fees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business) and other income related to employee retention credits.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s financial statements filed with the SEC.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Words such as, \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"continues,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"goal,\" \"objectives,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"opportunity,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"near-term,\" \"long-term,\" \"projections,\" \"assumptions,\" \"projects,\" \"guidance,\" \"forecasts,\" \"outlook,\" \"target,\" \"trends,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Specific forward looking statements made in this press release include, among others, our belief that our long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer headwinds; our commitment to our refranchising efforts, elevating patient care, ensuring strong clinic economics, strengthening our people, capability and culture, and fueling innovation to drive growth and improve profitability; our confidence that with the power behind The Joint franchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics, increase patient count and drive growth, we will emerge a stronger company; and our expectations for 2024 system-wide sales, system-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more, and new franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, our inability to identify and recruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our clinics, due in part to the nationwide labor shortage and an increase in operating expenses due to measures we may need to take to address such shortage; inflation, which has increased our costs and which could otherwise negatively impact our business; our failure to profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics; our failure to refranchise as planned; short-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and result in class action lawsuits; our failure to remediate future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence; and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024 and subsequently filed current and quarterly reports. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\n\n**About The Joint Corp.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nThe Joint Corp. Reports Third Quarter\n2024 Financial Results\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Joint Corp. (NASDAQ:\nJYNT), a national operator, manager, and franchisor of chiropractic clinics, reported its\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nFinancial Highlights: Q3 2024 Compared to Q3 2023\nGrew revenue 2% to $30.2 million.\nReported net loss of $3.2 million, including $3.8 million in loss on disposition or\nimpairment, compared to net loss of $716,000, including loss on disposition or\nimpairment of $905,000.\nReported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million.\nIncreased system-wide sales1 8% to $129.3 million.\nReported system-wide comp sales2 of 4%.\nSold 7 franchise licenses in both Q3 2024 and Q2 2024, compared to 12 in Q3 2023,\nreflecting the impact of the refranchising process.\nIncreased the total clinic count to 963 – 838 clinics franchised and 125 clinics\ncompany-owned or managed – at September 30, 2024. During Q3 2024, The Joint\nOpened 14 franchised clinics;\nRefranchised one clinic; and\nClosed 11 clinics: three franchised being relocated, three non-traditional\ncorporate units on Airforce bases; as well as three franchised and two company-\nowned or managed that were underperforming.\n“As the category leader with a premier national brand, attractive asset-light franchise model\nand approximately 1% share of the $8.5 billion being spent annually out-of-pocket on\nchiropractic care, The Joint’s long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer\nheadwinds,” said President and Chief Executive Officer of The Joint Corp. Sanjiv Razdan.\n“To lead The Joint’s next phase of growth, I will leverage my strategic business acumen,\nbranding expertise and extensive experience leading successful multi-site consumer service\ncompanies and franchise businesses. The board and I are committed to our refranchising\nefforts; elevating patient care; ensuring strong clinic economics; strengthening our people,\ncapability and culture; and fueling innovation to drive growth and improve profitability. With\nthe power behind The Joint franchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics,\nincrease patient count, and drive growth will increase profitability and create shareholder\nvalue. I am confident we will emerge a stronger company.”\nFinancial Results for Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023\nRevenue was $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.5 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. Cost of revenue was $2.8 million, compared to $2.6 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, reflecting the associated higher regional developer royalties and\ncommissions.\nSelling and marketing expenses were $4.8 million, compared to $4.3 million, reflecting the\ntiming of advertising spend. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 47% for the\nthird quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of\ncorporate clinics that are being held for sale in connection with the refranchising efforts.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.8 million, up from $20.2 million in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nLoss on disposition or impairment was $3.8 million, related to the quarterly impairment\nanalysis of clinics held for sale as part of the refranchising efforts, compared to $905,000 in\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nIncome tax expense was $63,000, compared to income tax benefit of $188,000 in the third\nquarter of 2023. Net loss was $3.2 million, including $3.8 million loss on disposition or\nimpairment, or $0.21 loss per share. This compares to net loss of $716,000, including the\n$905,000 loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.05 loss per share, in the third quarter of\n2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million, compared to $2.9 million the third quarter of 2023.\nFinancial Results for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September\n30, 2023\nRevenue was $90.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $87.1 million in the\nsame period of 2023. Net loss was $5.8 million, including $5.6 million loss on disposition or\nimpairment and $1.5 million in employee litigation in the second quarter of 2024, or $0.39\nloss per share. This compares net income for the first nine months of 2023 of $1.3 million,\nincluding the $3.9 million in other income related to the net employee retention credit and\n$1.1 million of loss on disposition or impairment, or $0.09 earnings per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $8.2 million for the same period of 2023.\nBalance Sheet Liquidity\nUnrestricted cash was $20.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nincludes $5.3 million from operations and the net proceeds of the sales of clinics offset by\nongoing IT capex and the $2.0 million first quarter 2024 repayment of the line of credit to JP\nMorgan Chase. Through this facility, we have retained immediate access to $20 million\nthrough February 2027.\n2024 Guidance\nThe company adjusted its guidance to account the potential impact of ongoing consumer\nheadwinds.\nSystem-wide sales are expected to be between $525 million and $535 million, adjusted\nfrom $530 million and $545 million and compared to $488.0 million in 2023.\nSystem-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more are expected to be\nbetween 3% and 4% adjusted from in the mid-single digits in 2024 and compared to\n4% in 2023.\nNew franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics, are\nexpected to be between 55 and 60, adjusted from 60 and 75 and compared to 104 in\n2023.\nConference Call\nThe Joint Corp. management will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on\nThursday, November 7, 2024, after the market close. Stockholders and interested\nparticipants may listen to a live broadcast of the conference call by dialing 1-(833) 630-0823\nor (412) 317-1831 and ask to be joined into the ‘The Joint’ call approximately 15 minutes\nprior to the start time.\nThe live webcast of the call with accompanying slide presentation can be accessed in the IR\nevents section https://ir.thejoint.com/events and available for approximately one year. An\naudio archive can be accessed for one week by dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088\nand entering conference ID 3620356.\nCommonly Discussed Performance Metrics\nThis release includes a presentation of commonly discussed performance metrics. System-\nwide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operated by the company or by\nfranchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company,\nmanagement believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial\nperformance, because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and\nrecords royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. System-\nwide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and\nfranchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any\nclinics that have closed.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis release also includes a presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important measures used by\nmanagement to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more\ntransparent view of the company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends.\nReconciliation of historical net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented\nin the table below. The company defines EBITDA as net income/(loss) before net interest,\ntax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The company defines Adjusted\nEBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses (which includes contract\ntermination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), net (gain)/loss on\ndisposition or impairment, stock-based compensation expenses, costs related to\nrestatement filings, restructuring costs, litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related\nfees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business) and\nother income related to employee retention credits.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives\nto net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are\nused as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service\nrequirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other\ncompanies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s financial statements\nfiled with the SEC.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute\nforward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs,\nassumptions and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating\nperformance and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to\nus. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Words such as, \"anticipates,\"\n\"believes,\" \"continues,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"goal,\" \"objectives,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\"\n\"opportunity,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"near-term,\" \"long-term,\" \"projections,\" \"assumptions,\"\n\"projects,\" \"guidance,\" \"forecasts,\" \"outlook,\" \"target,\" \"trends,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\"\n\"will,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.\nSpecific forward looking statements made in this press release include, among others, our\nbelief that our long-term opportunities far exceed the near-term consumer headwinds; our\ncommitment to our refranchising efforts, elevating patient care, ensuring strong clinic\neconomics, strengthening our people, capability and culture, and fueling innovation to drive\ngrowth and improve profitability; our confidence that with the power behind The Joint\nfranchise concept, our strategies to improve clinic economics, increase patient count and\ndrive growth, we will emerge a stronger company; and our expectations for 2024 system-\nwide sales, system-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more, and new\nfranchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics. Forward-looking\nstatements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking\nstatements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could\ncontribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, our inability to identify and\nrecruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our clinics, due in part to\nthe nationwide labor shortage and an increase in operating expenses due to measures we\nmay need to take to address such shortage; inflation, which has increased our costs and\nwhich could otherwise negatively impact our business; our failure to profitably operate\ncompany-owned or managed clinics; our failure to refranchise as planned; short-selling\nstrategies and negative opinions posted on the internet, which could drive down the market\nprice of our common stock and result in class action lawsuits; our failure to remediate future\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively\nimpact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor\nconfidence; and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section\nentitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023 filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024 and subsequently filed current and quarterly\nreports. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We\nassume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or\nto update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nComparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any\nfuture trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should\nonly be viewed as historical data.\nAbout The Joint Corp.

          "content": "Q3 2024\nResults\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024| Reported on Nov. 7, 2024\nSafe Harbor Statements\nCertain statements contained in this presentation are \"forward-looking statements” about future events and expectations. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs,\nassumptions and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available\nto us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Words such as, \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"continues,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"goal,\" \"objectives,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\"\n\"opportunity,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"near-term,\" \"long-term,\" \"projections,\" \"assumptions,\" \"projects,\" \"guidance,\" \"forecasts,\" \"outlook,\" \"target,\" \"trends,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\"\n\"will,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Specific forward looking statements made in this presentation include, among others\nour guiding principles of elevating patient care, strengthening clinic economics, fueling innovation in everything we do, and building people capability and culture; our belief\nthat refranchising the vast majority of our corporate-owned clinics will general capital, increase franchise royalty revenue, and reduce corporate costs; our focus on new patient\nacquisition through increasing awareness campaigns, focusing on the top of the lead generation funnel, implementing Goggle P-Max, engaging “switchers,” and attracting new\nto chiropractic care; our expectations for 2024 system-wide sales, system-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more, and new franchised clinic openings, excluding\nthe impact of refranchised clinics ; our upside for future growth; our substantial market growth opportunity; and our belief that people will continue to seek more noninvasive\nholistic ways to manage their pain, and we’ll be there to treat them. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors\nthat could contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, our inability to identify and recruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our\nclinics, due in part to the nationwide labor shortage and an increase in operating expenses due to measures we may need to take to address such shortage; inflation, and the\ncurrent war in Ukraine, which has increased our costs and which could otherwise negatively impact our business; the potential for disruption to our operations and the\nunpredictable impact on our business of outbreaks of contagious diseases; our failure to profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics; short-selling strategies and\nnegative opinions posted on the internet, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and result in class actionlawsuits; our failure to remediate future\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain\ninvestor confidence; and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024 and subsequently-filed current and quarterly reports. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these\ncautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially\nfrom those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are\nnot intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nBusiness Structure\nThe Joint Corp. is a franchisor of clinics and an operator of clinics in certain states.

All Rights Reserved. 16\nPerformance Metrics and Non-GAAP Measures\nThis presentation of commonly discussed performance metrics. System-wide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operatedby the company or by\nfranchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the\ncompany’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial\nhealth of the franchisee base. System-wide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case\nhave been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed.\nThis presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important measures used by management\nto assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the company’s underlying operating performance and operating\ntrends. Reconciliation of historical net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The company defines EBITDA as net\nincome/(loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-\nrelated expenses (which includes contract termination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), net (gain)/loss on disposition or impairment,\nstock-based compensation expenses, costs related to restatement filings, restructuring costs, litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related fees for specific\nproceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business) and other income related to employee retention credits.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measuresoffinancial performance and the\nability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies\nin the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s financial statements filed with the SEC.\n© 2024 The Joint Corp.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “intend,” “seek,” “strive,” or the negative of these terms, “mission,” “goal,” “objective,” or “strategy,” or other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, uncertainties and risks that could affect our future results or operations as described from time to time in our SEC reports, including those risks outlined under “Risk Factors” which are contained in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of this or any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These factors, uncertainties and risks may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information contained in the reports we file with or furnish to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, other than in accordance with legal and regulatory obligations. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. \n\nThe specific forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the following:\n\n•that we seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic care in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry through the rapid and focused expansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and potentially abroad; \n\n•our belief that our monthly performance reports from our system and our clinics include key performance indicators per clinic, including gross sales, comparable same-store sales growth, or “Comp Sales,” number of new patients, conversion percentage and membership attrition;\n\n•our plan to re-franchise or sell the majority of our company-owned or managed clinics, which refined strategy will leverage our greatest strength - our capacity to build a franchise - to drive long-term growth for both our franchisees and The Joint as a public company;\n\n•our belief that the strong results with respect to our franchise licenses sold and our regional developers reflects the power of the regional developer program to accelerate the number of clinics sold, and eventually opened across the country;\n\n•our belief that we continue to have a sound business concept and will benefit from the fundamental changes taking place in the manner in which Americans access chiropractic care and their growing interest in seeking effective, affordable natural solutions for general wellness; \n\n•our belief that these trends join with the preference we have seen among chiropractic doctors to reject the insurance-based model to produce a combination that benefits the consumer and the service provider alike, and our belief that these forces create an important opportunity to accelerate the growth of our network;\n\n•our belief that recent events that may impact our business include unfavorable global economic or political conditions, such as the Ukraine War, the Israel-Gaza conflict, labor shortages, and inflation and other cost increases; \n\n•our anticipation that 2024 will continue to be a volatile macroeconomic environment;\n\n•our belief that we have created a robust framework for the re-franchising effort, organizing clinics into clusters, and generating comprehensive disclosure packets for marketing efficiency, and that we have received significant interest to date from our existing franchisees;\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\n•our goal to generate significant processes that will provide us with value creating capital allocation opportunities, which opportunities could include, but are not limited to, reinvestment in the brand and related marketing, continued investment in our IT platforms, the repurchase of regional development (\"RD\") territories, and/or a stock repurchase program;\n\n•our belief that our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new clinic sales, openings, closures, markets in which they are contained and related expenses, general economic conditions, cost inflation, labor shortages, consumer confidence in the economy, consumer preferences, competitive factors, and disease epidemics and other health-related concerns;\n\n•our belief that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and investment needs for at least the next 12 months;\n\n•our belief that we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business; and\n\n•our expectation that for the remainder of 2024, we expect to use or redeploy our cash resources to support our business within the context of prevailing market conditions, which, given the ongoing uncertainties described above, could rapidly and materially deteriorate or otherwise change.\n\nSome of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n•the nationwide labor shortage has negatively impacted our ability to recruit chiropractors and other qualified personnel, which may limit our growth strategy, and the measures we have taken in response to the labor shortage have reduced our net revenues; \n\n•inflation has led to increased labor costs and interest rates and may lead to reduced discretionary spending, all of which may negatively impact our business;\n\n•we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if our franchisees are unable to locate and secure appropriate sites for clinic locations, obtain favorable lease terms, and attract patients to our clinics;\n\n•we have limited experience operating company-owned or managed clinics in those geographic areas where we currently have few or no clinics, and we may not be able to duplicate the success of some of our franchisees;\n\n•short-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet may drive down the market price of our common stock and could result in class action lawsuits; \n\n•we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and we may fail to remediate future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or may otherwise be unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, which might negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence;\n\n•we may fail to successfully design and maintain our proprietary and third-party management information systems or implement new systems;\n\n•we have restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price;\n\n•we may fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement, upgrade or consolidate existing information systems;\n\n•we may not be able to continue to sell franchises to qualified franchisees, and our franchisees may not succeed in developing profitable territories and clinics;\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\n•new clinics may not reach the point of profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or improve revenues and franchise fees from existing franchised clinics;\n\n•the chiropractic industry is highly competitive, with many well-established independent competitors, which could prevent us from increasing our market share or result in reduction in our market share;\n\n•state administrative actions and rulings regarding the corporate practice of chiropractic and prepayment of chiropractic services may jeopardize our business model;\n\n•expected new federal regulations and state laws and regulations regarding joint employer responsibilitycould negatively impact the franchise business model,increasing our potential liability for employment law violations by our franchisees and the likelihood that we may be required to participate in collective bargaining with our franchisees’ employees; \n\n•an increased regulatory focus on the establishment of fair franchise practices could increase our risk of liability in disputes with franchisees and the risk of enforcement actions and penalties;\n\n•adverse developments affecting institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance;\n\n•negative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns expressed by opponents of chiropractic and by chiropractors operating under traditional service models, could adversely impact our operations and financial position;\n\n•our IT security systems and those of our third-party service providers (as recently experienced by one of our marketing vendors) may be breached, and we may face civil liability and public perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients;\n\n•new SEC regulations governing disclosure about risk management, strategy and governance regarding cybersecurity risks and new requirements for reporting of cybersecurity incidents may increase our compliance costs;\n\n•legislation, regulations, as well as new medical procedures and techniques, could reduce or eliminate our competitive advantages; and\n\n•the delayed filing of one of our quarterly reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\n\nAdditionally, there may be other risks that are otherwise described from time to time in the reports that we file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be considered in light of various important factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed above, as well as others.\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nPART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1.

AND SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATES\n\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThese unaudited financial statements represent the condensed consolidated financial statements of The Joint Corp. (“The Joint”), which includes its variable interest entities (“VIEs”), and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Joint Corporate Unit No. 1, LLC (collectively, the “Company”). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with The Joint Corp. and Subsidiary and Affiliates consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as set forth in The Joint’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024, which included all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of expected operating results for the full year. The information presented throughout the document as of and for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is unaudited.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other (expenses) income that are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates. For a discussion of significant estimates and judgments made in recognizing revenue, accounting for leases, long-lived asset impairments and accounting for income taxes, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Joint and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Joint Corporate Unit No. 1, LLC, which was dormant for all periods presented. The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations (“ASC 810”). Non-controlling interests represent third-party equity ownership interests in VIEs. All significant inter-affiliate accounts and transactions between The Joint and its VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nComprehensive Income\n\nNet income (loss) was the same as comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nNature of Operations\n\nThe Joint Corp., a Delaware corporation, was formed on March 10, 2010 for the principal purpose of franchising and developing chiropractic clinics, selling regional developer rights, supporting the operations of franchised chiropractic clinics, and operating and managing corporate chiropractic clinics at locations throughout the United States. The franchising of chiropractic clinics is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and various state authorities.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of clinics in operation under franchise agreements and as company-owned or managed clinics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \nFranchised clinics:| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nClinics open at beginning of period| 829 | 756 | 800 | 712  \nOpened during the period| 14 | 24 | 46 | 76  \nAcquired during the period| 1 | — | 3 | —  \nSold during the period| — | — | — | (3)  \nClosed during the period| (6)| (2)| (11)| (7)  \nClinics in operation at the end of the period| 838 | 778 | 838 | 778  \nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \nCompany-owned or managed clinics:| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nClinics open at beginning of period| 131 | 134 | 135 | 126  \nOpened during the period| — | 2 | — | 9  \nAcquired during the period| — | — | — | 3  \nSold during the period| (1)| — | (3)| —  \nClosed during the period| (5)| — | (7)| (2)  \nClinics in operation at the end of the period| 125 | 136 | 125 | 136  \nTotal clinics in operation at the end of the period| 963 | 914 | 963 | 914  \nClinic licenses sold but not yet developed| 102 | 155 | 102 | 155  \nFuture clinic licenses subject to executed letters of intent| 46 | 42 | 46 | 42  \n  \nVariable Interest Entities\n\nCertain states prohibit the “corporate practice of chiropractic,” which restricts business corporations from practicing chiropractic care by exercising control over clinical decisions by chiropractic doctors. In states that prohibit the corporate practice of chiropractic, the Company typically enters into long-term management agreements with professional corporations (“PCs”) that are owned by licensed chiropractic doctors, which, in turn, employ or contract with doctors who provide professional chiropractic care in its clinics. Under these management agreements with PCs, the Company provides, on an exclusive basis, all non-clinical services of the chiropractic practice. The Company has entered into such management agreements with four PCs. If an entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is required to consolidate the VIE in its financial statements. An entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, these PCs were determined to be VIEs, as fees paid by the PCs to the Company as its management service provider are considered variable interests because the fees do not meet all the following criteria: (1) the fees are compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services; (2) the decision maker or service provider does not hold other interests in the VIE that individually, or in the aggregate, would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the VIE’s expected losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the VIE’s expected residual returns; and (3) the service arrangement includes only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm’s length. Additionally, the Company has determined that it has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of these PCs and has an obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits which could potentially be significant to the PCs. Accordingly, the PCs are VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and are consolidated by the Company.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nVIE total revenue, general and administrative expenses and income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenues| $| 10,242,319 | $| 10,688,500 | $| 30,739,977 | $| 30,997,617  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 4,527,176 | 4,525,305 | 13,749,229 | 13,614,211  \nIncome tax expense| 109,693 | 129,849 | 322,562 | 217,655  \n  \nThe carrying amount of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities was immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, except for the balances as follows:\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nDeferred tax assets| 1,088,802 | 1,088,802  \nPayroll liabilities| 710,914 | 728,130  \nDeferred revenue from company managed clinics| 3,183,397 | 1,558,178  \nLiabilities to be disposed of| 1,378,295 | 3,622,481  \nOther liabilities| 1,235,241 | 1,235,241  \n  \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. As of the balance sheet date and periodically throughout the period, the Company has maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has invested substantially all of its cash in short-term bank deposits. The Company had no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash relates to cash that franchisees and company-owned or managed clinics contribute to the Company’s National Marketing Fund and cash that franchisees provide to various voluntary regional Co-Op Marketing Funds. Cash contributed by franchisees to the National Marketing Fund is to be used in accordance with the Company’s Franchise Disclosure Document with a focus on regional and national marketing and advertising. While such cash balance is not legally segregated and restricted as to withdrawal or usage, the Company’s accounting policy is to classify these funds as restricted cash.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable primarily represents amounts due from franchisees for royalty fees. The Company records an allowance for credit losses as a reduction to its accounts receivables for amounts that the Company does not expect to recover. An allowance for credit losses is determined through assessments of collectability based on historical trends, the financial condition of the Company’s franchisees, including any known or anticipated bankruptcies and an evaluation of current economic conditions, as well as the Company’s expectations of conditions in the future. Actual losses ultimately could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for expected credit losses of $0.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost or for property acquired as part of franchise acquisitions at fair value at the date of closing. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which is generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. When items of property or equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income. The net losses on disposed of or retired property or equipment were recorded \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nin net loss on disposition or impairment of $3,549 and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The losses on disposed of or retired property or equipment were recorded in net loss on disposition or impairment of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nLeases\n\nThe Company leases property and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company leases its corporate office space and the space for each of the company-owned or managed clinics in the portfolio. The Company recognizes a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability for all leases. Certain leases include one or more renewal options, generally for the same period as the initial term of the lease. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at the Company’s sole discretion and, as such, the Company typically determines that exercise of these renewal options is not reasonably certain. As a result, the Company does not include the renewal option period in the expected lease term and the associated lease payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for substantially all of its leases. In such cases, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate it would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term, with similar collateral as in the lease and in a similar economic environment. The Company estimates these rates using available evidence such as rates imposed by third-party lenders to the Company in recent financings or observable risk-free interest rate and credit spreads for commercial debt of a similar duration, with credit spreads correlating to the Company’s estimated creditworthiness.\n\nFor operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date it takes possession of the leased property. Pre-opening costs are recorded as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments, such as percentage rentals based on location sales, periodic adjustments for inflation, reimbursement of real estate taxes, any variable common area maintenance and any other variable costs associated with the leased property are expensed as incurred and are also included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 certain leases were terminated early with the landlord as a result of corporate clinic closures. The net losses to terminate the leases were recorded in net loss on disposition or impairment of $32,775 and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. No leases were terminated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nLong-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. The Company looks primarily to estimated undiscounted future cash flows in its assessment of whether or not long-lived assets are recoverable. The Company records an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, property and equipment, net, and ROU assets related to asset groups determined to not be recoverable were written down from their carrying values to their respective fair values resulting in the following non-cash impairment losses:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024  \n---  \nCarrying Value| Fair Value| Net loss on disposition or impairment  \nProperty and equipment, net| $| 600,223 | $| 476,270 | $| 123,953  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 1,663,127 | 1,301,787 | 361,340  \nTotal Net loss on disposition or impairment| $| 485,293  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, property and equipment, net, ROU assets and franchise rights related to asset groups determined to not be recoverable were written down from their carrying values to their respective fair values resulting in the following non-cash impairment losses:\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024  \n---  \nCarrying Value| Fair Value| Net loss on disposition or impairment  \nProperty and equipment, net| $| 2,500,915 | $| 1,865,255 | $| 635,660  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 2,100,591 | 1,731,402 | 369,189  \nIntangible assets, net| $| 298,510 | $| 252,746 | 45,764  \nTotal Net loss on disposition or impairment| $| 1,050,613  \n  \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, intangible assets related to a clinic planned for closure with a total carrying amount of approximately $0.1 million was written down to zero. As a result, the Company recorded a noncash impairment loss of approximately $0.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nLong-lived assets that meet the criteria for the held for sale designation are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated cost to sell. As a result of its evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale relative to the agreed upon sales prices or the clinics estimated fair values, the Company recorded an estimated net loss on disposal in loss on disposition or impairment in its condensed consolidated income statement as follows:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet loss on disposition or impairment| $| 1,865,124 | $| 756,228 | $| 2,570,461 | $| 816,429  \n  \nA valuation allowance of $3.1 million and $0.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in assets held for sale on its condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLong-lived assets previously classified as held for sale that no longer meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale are reclassified as held and used and are reported at the lower of their carrying amount before the long-lived assets (disposal groups) were classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the long-lived assets (disposal groups) been continuously classified as held and used, or the fair value of the disposal groups at the date of the subsequent change in circumstances no longer meeting the criteria to designate the disposal groups as held for sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain clinics classified as held for sale at December 31, 2023 no longer met the criteria for held for sale. As a result, the Company reclassified $5.3 million from assets held for sale to $1.4 million in property and equipment, net and $3.8 million in ROU assets and reclassified $5.2 million from liabilities to be disposed of to $3.5 million in operating lease liability and $1.7 million in deferred revenue from company clinics. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of $1.4 million in net loss disposition and impairment on the condensed consolidated income statement to adjust the carrying values of (i) property and equipment, net down to $0.9 million and (ii) ROU \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nassets down to $3.0 million for the depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of the Company’s impairment losses and disposal gains and losses recorded in net loss on disposition or impairment for the three and ninemonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023t:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nImpairment on long-lived assets held for use  \nProperty and equipment, net| $| 123,953 | $| — | $| 635,660 | $| —  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 361,340 | 80,495 | 369,189 | 80,499  \nIntangible assets, net| — | — | 45,764 | —  \nImpairment on assets held for sale  \nAssets held for sale| 1,865,124 | 756,228 | 2,570,461 | 816,429  \nImpairment on long-lived assets previously held for sale reclassified as held for use  \nProperty and equipment, net| 528,849 | — | 528,849 | —  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 876,224 | — | 876,224 | —  \nLoss on disposal of assets  \nProperty and equipment, net| 3,549 | 68,200 | 196,457 | 217,810  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 32,775 | — | 406,039 | —  \nLoss (gain) on sale of assets| 13,404 | (26,002)  \nTotal Net loss on disposition or impairment| $| 3,805,218 | $| 904,923 | $| 5,602,641 | $| 1,114,738  \n  \nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company generates revenue primarily through its company-owned and managed clinics and through royalties, franchise fees, advertising fund contributions, IT-related income and computer software fees from its franchisees.\n\nRevenues from Company-Owned or Managed Clinics. The Company earns revenues from clinics that it owns and operates or manages throughout the United States. Revenues are recognized when services are performed. The Company offers a variety of membership and wellness packages, which feature discounted pricing as compared with its single-visit pricing. Amounts collected in advance for membership and wellness packages are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the service is performed. Any unused visits associated with monthly memberships are recognized on a month-to-month basis. The Company recognizes a contract liability (or a deferred revenue liability) related to the prepaid treatment plans for which the Company has an ongoing performance obligation. The Company derecognizes this contract liability and recognizes revenue, as the patient consumes his or her visits related to the package and the Company transfers its services. If the Company determines that it is not subject to unclaimed property laws for the portion of wellness package that it does not expect to be redeemed (referred to as “breakage”), then it recognizes breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights by the patient.\n\nRoyalties and Advertising Fund Revenue. The Company collects royalties from its franchisees, as stipulated in the franchise agreement, equal to 7% of gross sales and a marketing and advertising fee currently equal to 2% of gross sales. Royalties, including franchisee contributions to advertising funds, are calculated as a percentage of clinic sales over the term of the franchise agreement. The revenue accounting standard provides an exception for the recognition of sales-based royalties promised in exchange for a license (which generally requires a reporting entity to estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in the transaction price). Franchise agreement royalties, inclusive of advertising fund contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to the Company’s performance obligation under the franchise agreement and therefore, such royalties are recognized as franchisee clinic level sales occur. Royalties are collected semi-monthly two working days after each sales period has ended.\n\nFranchise Fees. The Company requires the entire non-refundable initial franchise fee to be paid upon execution of a franchise agreement, which typically has an initial term of 10 years. Initial franchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. The Company’s services under the franchise agreement include training of franchisees and staff, site selection, construction/vendor management and ongoing operations support. The Company provides no financing to \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nfranchisees and offers no guarantees on their behalf. The services provided by the Company are highly interrelated with the franchise license and as such are considered to represent a single performance obligation. Renewal franchise fees, as well as transfer fees, are also recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement.\n\nSoftware Fees. The Company collects a monthly fee from its franchisees for use of its proprietary chiropractic software, computer support and internet services support. These fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement.\n\nCapitalized Sales Commissions. Sales commissions earned by the regional developers and the Company’s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a franchise agreement with a franchisee. These costs are deferred and then amortized as the respective franchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement.\n\nRegional Developer Fees\n\nThe Company has a regional developer program where regional developers are granted an exclusive geographical territory and commit to a minimum development obligation within that defined territory. Regional developer fees paid to the Company are non-refundable and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the regional developer agreement and recognized as a decrease to franchise cost of revenues.\n\nIn addition, regional developers receive fees that are funded by the initial franchise fees collected from franchisees upon the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical territory and a royalty of 3% of sales generated by franchised clinics within their exclusive geographical territory. Initial fees related to the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical territory are initially deferred as deferred franchise costs and are recognized as an expense in franchise cost of revenues when the respective revenue is recognized, which is generally over the term of the related franchise agreement. Royalties of 3% of sales generated by franchised clinics in their regions are also recognized as franchise cost of revenues as franchisee clinic level sales occur. This 3% fee is funded by the 7% royalties collected from the franchisees in their regions. Certain regional developer agreements result in the regional developer acquiring the rights to existing royalty streams from clinics already open in the respective territory. In those instances, the revenue associated from the sale of the royalty stream is recognized over the remaining life of the respective franchise agreements. The Company did not enter into any new regional developer agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nRegional Developer Rights Contract Termination Costs\n\nFrom time to time, subject to the Company’s strategy, regional developer rights are reacquired by the Company, resulting in a termination of the contract. The termination costs to reacquire the regional developer rights are recognized at fair value, less any unrecognized upfront regional developer fee liability balance, as a general and administrative expense in the period in which the contract is terminated in accordance with the contract terms. Termination costs to reacquire the regional developer rights were zero and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Termination costs to reacquire the regional developer rights were zero and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nAdvertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs are advertising and marketing expenses incurred by the Company, primarily through advertising funds. The Company expenses production costs of commercial advertising upon first airing and expenses the costs of communicating the advertising in the period in which the advertising occurs. Advertising expenses were $1.3 million and $5.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Advertising expenses were $1.8 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense during interim periods is based on applying an estimated annual effective income tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus any significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that are recorded in the interim period. The computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the expected pre-tax income for the year and permanent differences. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information becomes known or as the tax environment changes.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nEarnings (loss) per Common Share\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares including restricted stock and stock options.\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet (loss) income| $| (3,165,139)| $| (716,273)| $| (5,814,558)| $| 1,289,402  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic| 14,959,132 | 14,790,663 | 14,903,726 | 14,666,222  \nEffect of dilutive securities:  \nUnvested restricted stock and stock options| 233,247 | 225,290 | 234,422 | 265,252  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted| 15,192,379 | 15,015,953 | 15,138,148 | 14,931,474  \nBasic (loss) earnings per share| $| (0.21)| $| (0.05)| $| (0.39)| $| 0.09  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share| $| (0.21)| $| (0.05)| $| (0.39)| $| 0.09  \n  \nThe following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the periods presented because including them would have been antidilutive:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \nWeighted average dilutive securities:| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRestricted stocks| — | — | — | —  \nStock options| 78,764 | 121,699 | 81,363 | 89,883  \n  \nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments by recognizing compensation expense based upon the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The Company determines the estimated grant-date fair value of restricted shares using the closing price on the date of the grant and the grant-date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. To calculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding the components of the model, including risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield and expected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation. The Company recognizes compensation costs ratably over the period of service using the straight-line method. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical and forecasted turnover, which is approximately 5%.\n\nLoss Contingencies\n\nASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. The Company records an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an accrual is not required, the Company provides additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on the Company. Legal costs to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as such costs are incurred.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to significant estimates and assumptions include the allowance for credit losses, \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nloss contingencies, share-based compensations, useful lives and realizability of long-lived assets, deferred revenue and revenue recognition related to breakage, deferred franchise costs, calculation of ROU assets and liabilities related to leases, realizability of deferred tax assets, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangible assets, impairment of other long-lived assets, and purchase price allocations and related valuations.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted and Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities to provide greater disaggregation within their annual rate reconciliation, including new requirements to present reconciling items on a gross basis in specified categories, disclose both percentages and dollar amounts and disaggregate individual reconciling items by jurisdiction and nature when the effect of the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires disaggregating the annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, by federal (national), state and foreign taxes, with separate presentation of individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by this standard and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 on an interim and annual basis, including new requirements to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure(s) of a segment's profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nNote 2: Revenue Disclosures\n\nCompany-Owned or Managed Clinics\n\nThe Company earns revenues from clinics that it owns and operates or manages throughout the United States. Revenues are recognized when services are performed. The Company offers a variety of membership and wellness packages that feature discounted pricing as compared with its single-visit pricing. Amounts collected in advance for membership and wellness packages are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the service is performed or in accordance with the Company’s breakage policy as discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition.\n\nFranchising Fees, Royalty Fees, Advertising Fund Revenue, and Software Fees\n\nThe Company currently franchises its concept across 41 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The franchise arrangement is documented in the form of a franchise agreement. The franchise arrangement requires the Company to perform various activities to support the brand that do not directly transfer goods and services to the franchisee, but instead represent a single performance obligation, which is the transfer of the franchise license. The intellectual property subject to the franchise license is symbolic intellectual property as it does not have significant standalone functionality and substantially all of the utility is derived from its association with the Company’s past or ongoing activities. The nature of the Company’s promise in granting the franchise license is to provide the franchisee with access to the brand’s symbolic intellectual property over the term of the license. The services provided by the Company are highly interrelated with the franchise license and as such are considered to represent a single performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price in a standard franchise arrangement primarily consists of (a) initial franchise fees, (b) continuing franchise fees (royalties), (c) advertising fees, and (d) software fees. The revenue accounting standard provides an exception for the recognition of sales-based royalties promised in exchange for a license (which otherwise requires a reporting entity to estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in the transaction price). \n\nThe Company recognizes the primary components of the transaction price as follows:\n\n•Initial and renewal franchise fees, as well as transfer fees, are recognized as revenue ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement, commencing with the execution of the franchise, renewal or transfer \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nagreement. As these fees are typically received in cash at or near the beginning of the contract term, the cash received is initially recorded as a contract liability until recognized as revenue over time.\n\n•The Company is entitled to royalties and advertising fees based on a percentage of the franchisee’s gross sales as defined in the franchise agreement. Royalty and advertising revenue are recognized when the franchisee’s sales occur. Depending on timing within a fiscal period, the recognition of revenue results in either what is considered a contract asset (unbilled receivable) or, once billed, accounts receivable, on the balance sheet.\n\n•The Company is entitled to a software fee, which is charged monthly. The Company recognizes revenue related to software fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. \n\nIn determining the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers, the Company exercises significant judgment with respect to collectability of the amount; however, the timing of recognition does not require significant judgment as it is based on either the franchise term, the reported sales of the franchisee, or the clinic opening date, none of which require estimation. The Company believes its franchising arrangements do not contain a significant financing component.\n\nThe Company recognizes advertising fees received under franchise agreements as advertising fund revenue.\n\nCapitalized Sales Commissions\n\nSales commissions earned by the regional developers and the Company’s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a franchise agreement with a franchisee. These costs are deferred and then amortized as the respective franchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement.\n\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe Company believes that the captions contained on the condensed consolidated income statements appropriately reflect the disaggregation of its revenue by major type for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other revenues primarily consist of preferred vendor royalties associated with franchisees’ credit card transactions.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s revenues disaggregated according to the timing of transfer of services:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenue recognized at a point in time| $| 28,069,481 | $| 27,418,343 | $| 83,875,419 | $| 81,155,737  \nRevenue recognized over time| 2,129,009 | 2,055,606 | 6,305,798 | 5,926,216  \nTotal Revenue| $| 30,198,490 | $| 29,473,949 | $| 90,181,217 | $| 87,081,953  \n  \nRollforward of Accounts Receivable\n\nChanges in the Company’s accounts receivable, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nAccounts Receivable, Net  \n---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022| $| 3,911,272  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| $| 3,718,924  \nCash received against accounts receivable included at the beginning of the year| (3,158,145)  \nNet increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024| 2,859,884  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| $| 4,295,663  \n  \nRollforward of Contract Liabilities and Contract Assets\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nChanges in the Company’s contract liability for deferred revenue from Company clinics during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nDeferred Revenue from company clinics  \n---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022| $| 7,471,549  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| $| 4,463,747  \nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year| (4,173,367)  \nNet increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024| 2,893,016  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| $| 3,183,396  \n  \nChanges in the Company’s contract liability for deferred franchise fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: \n\nDeferred Revenueshort and long-term  \n---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022| $| 16,629,735  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| $| 16,113,879  \nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year| (1,997,255)  \nNet increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024| 1,099,561  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| $| 15,216,185  \n  \nThe Company’s deferred franchise and development costs represent capitalized sales commissions.

As of the acquisition date, the Company operated the franchises as company-managed clinics. The total purchase price for the transactions was $1,188,764 to the seller (of which $109,767 was paid in the third quarter of 2023)., less $28,997 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total purchase consideration of $1,159,767.\n\nBased on the terms of the purchase agreement, the CA Clinics Purchase has been treated as an asset purchase under GAAP as there were no outputs or processes to generate outputs acquired as part of these transactions. Under an asset purchase, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity. Cost is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. \n\nThe allocation of the total purchase price of the CA Clinics Purchase was as follows: \n\nProperty and equipment| $| 313,995  \n---|---|---  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 317,662  \nIntangible assets| 1,004,513  \nTotal assets acquired| 1,636,170  \nDeferred revenue| (158,365)  \nOperating lease liability - current portion| (118,081)  \nOperating lease liability - net of current portion| (199,957)  \nNet purchase consideration| $| 1,159,767  \n  \nIntangible assets in the table above primarily consisted of reacquired franchise rights of $0.7 million amortized over their estimated useful lives of six to seven years, customer relationships of $0.1 million amortized over an estimated useful life of two years, and assembled workforce of $0.2 million amortized over an estimated useful life of two years.\n\nAssets Held for Sale\n\nIn 2023, the Company initiated plans to re-franchise the majority of its corporate-owned or managed clinics with plans to retain a small portion of high-performing clinics. In Q3 2024, the Company expanded the re-franchising plan to include additional clinic markets of company-owned and company-managed clinics, marketing the clinics in clusters grouped by proximity to larger private equity firms. The clustered clinics are in varying stages of sales negotiations with approximately 60% of the Company's corporate clinic portfolio expected to close within one year with an estimated fair value of $19.5 million at September 30, 2024. The clinics sold or classified as held for sale at September 30, 2024 under the re-franchise plan did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect. As a result, the results of these clinics will continue to be reported in the Company’s operating results and in its Corporate Clinics segment until the sales are each finalized. Effective with the designation as held for sale, the Company discontinued recording depreciation on property and equipment, net, amortization of intangible assets, net and amortization of ROU assets for the clinics as required by GAAP. The Company also separately classified the related assets and liabilities of the clinics as held for sale in its September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs a result of the change in the re-franchising marketing strategy during the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were certain high performing clinics with an estimated value of $13.8 million classified as held for sale at December 31, 2023 that no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as it was no longer probable the clinics will sell within one year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified $5.3 million from assets held for sale to $1.4 million in property and equipment, net and $3.8 million in operating lease right-of-use assets and reclassified $5.2 million from liabilities to be disposed of to $3.5 million in operating lease liability and $1.7 million in deferred revenue from company clinics. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of $1.4 million in net loss disposition and impairment on the condensed consolidated income statement to adjust the carrying values of (i) property and equipment, net down to $0.9 million and (ii) \n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\noperating lease right-of-use assets down to $3.0 million for any depreciation or other expense that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used as of September 30, 2024.\n\nLong-lived assets that meet the criteria for the held for sale designation are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated cost to sell. As a result of its evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale relative to the agreed upon sales prices or the clinics estimated fair values, the Company recorded an estimated loss on disposal of $1.9 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an estimated loss on disposal of $2.6 million and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in net loss on disposition or impairment in its condensed consolidated income statement. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the sale of company-owned and managed clinics classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023 for a combined sales price of $0.4 million, the Company sold $1.0 million assets held for sale, net of a $0.1 million valuation allowance and $0.7 million of liabilities to be disposed of in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As a result of the sales, the Company recorded a gain of zero and $39,000 in net loss disposition and impairment on the condensed consolidated income statement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe principal components of the held for sale assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nAssets  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 6,165,086 | $| 4,887,220  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 11,161,964 | 9,193,496  \nIntangible assets, net| 6,919,371 | 3,351,430  \nGoodwill| 4,221,293 | 1,140,529  \nValuation allowance| (3,132,999)| (657,620)  \nTotal assets held for sale| $| 25,334,715 | $| 17,915,055  \nLiabilities  \nOperating lease liability, current and non-current| $| 11,351,605 | $| 10,209,382  \nDeferred revenue from company clinics| 3,772,949 | 3,622,481  \nTotal liabilities to be disposed of| $| 15,124,554 | $| 13,831,863  \n  \nThe pre-tax income of the clinics designated as held for sale was $1.3 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the results of which exclude the allocation of overhead. The pre-tax income of the clinics designated as held for sale was $3.6 million and $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the results of which exclude the allocation of overhead.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nNote 4: Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following, excluding amounts related to properties classified as held for sale:\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nOffice and computer equipment| $| 3,325,514 | $| 4,169,576  \nLeasehold improvements| 8,917,358 | 12,013,250  \nSoftware developed| 5,898,001 | 5,399,698  \nFinance lease assets| 151,389 | 151,396  \n18,292,262 | 21,733,920  \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization| (12,903,490)| (12,005,459)  \n5,388,772 | 9,728,461  \nConstruction in progress| 696,013 | 1,315,856  \nProperty and equipment, net| $| 6,084,785 | $| 11,044,317  \n  \nDepreciation expense was $0.9 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation expense was $3.0 million and $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAmortization expense related to finance lease assets was $7,570 and $7,570 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense related to finance lease assets was $22,710 and $22,709 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nConstruction in progress at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 principally related to construction costs for company-owned or managed clinics and to the development of software.\n\nNote 5: Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt under the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7, Debt). The carrying amounts of its financial instruments, except for debt, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities, which is considered a Level 1 fair value measurement. The carrying value of the Company’s debt under the Credit Agreement approximates fair value due to its interest rate being calculated from observable quoted prices for similar instruments, which is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.\n\nAuthoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis as Level 1, 2 or 3.\n\nThe Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their carrying amount. However, on a periodic basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\namount may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill), non-financial assets are assessed for impairment. If the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the asset to its fair value, which is considered Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe assets and liabilities resulting from the Acquisitions (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Assets Held for Sale) were recorded at fair values on a nonrecurring basis and are considered Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nLong-lived assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The estimated fair values of the company-owned or managed clinics classified as Held for Sale (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Assets Held for Sale) were recorded at fair values on a nonrecurring basis and are based upon Level 2 inputs, which includes a potential buyer agreed upon selling price or Level 3 inputs, which include the multiple earnings approach using historical financial performance of the clinic and historical acquisition trends based on previous reacquired franchise clinic purchases. The fair value measurement of the assets held for sale was recorded as $2.3 million based upon Level 2 inputs and $17.1 million based upon Level 3 inputs. As a result, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $3.1 million to adjust the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell as of September 30, 2024. \n\nLong-lived assets classified as held and used where the asset group was not determined to be recoverable are tested for impairment. The asset group was determined to be the clinic level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The long-lived assets fair values were determined by the following: Level 1 inputs, which included observable inputs from executed lease termination agreements; Level 2 inputs where available, which included using a valuation multiple (e.g, price per square foot) based on observable prices for comparable long-lived assets; and Level 3 inputs, which included the multiple earnings approach using the Company's historical earnings trend data, comparable historical asset sales by the Company and franchisees that were not exact matches, and (for calculating the fair value of intangible assets specifically) the Company’s historical experience, future projections and comparable market data include future cash flows, long-term growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates. \n\nThe carrying values of these asset groups impaired to their fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included ROU assets of $2.1 million that were written down to $1.7 million determined by Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The carrying values of these asset groups impaired to their fair value also included property and equipment, net of $2.5 million that were written down to $1.9 million and reacquired rights of $298,510 that were written down to $252,746 both determined by Level 3 inputs discussed above. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, included in the net loss, disposition and impairment on the condensed consolidated income statement for impairment of long-lived assets classified as held and used where the asset group was not determined to be recoverable.\n\nNote 6: Intangible Assets\n\nIn May 2023, the Company recognized $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million of reacquired franchise rights, customer relationships and acquired workforce, respectively, from the CA Clinics Purchase (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Assets Held for Sale).\n\nIntangible assets consisted of the following, excluding amounts related to intangible assets classified as held for sale:\n\nAs of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nGross CarryingAmount| AccumulatedAmortization| Net CarryingValue  \nIntangible assets subject to amortization:  \nReacquired franchise rights| $| 883,205 | $| (883,205)| $| —  \nCustomer relationships| 650,365 | (650,365)| —  \nAssembled workforce| — | — | —  \n$| 1,533,570 | $| (1,533,570)| $| —  \n  \n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023  \n---  \nGross CarryingAmount| AccumulatedAmortization| Net CarryingValue  \nIntangible assets subject to amortization:  \nReacquired franchise rights| $| 7,385,830 | $| (2,926,595)| $| 4,459,235  \nCustomer relationships| 1,682,807 | (1,349,938)| 332,869  \nAssembled workforce| 440,844 | (212,022)| 228,822  \n$| 9,509,481 | $| (4,488,555)| $| 5,020,926  \n  \nAmortization expense related to the Company’s intangible assets was $0.3 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense was $1.2 million and $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, no further amortization expense is expected for the remainder of 2024 and subsequent years as a result of the remaining net carrying value of intangible assets being reclassified as assets held for sale.\n\nNote 7: Debt\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nOn February 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., individually and as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank (the “Lender”). The Credit Agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) in the amount of $7,500,000, including a $2,000,000 revolver (the \"Revolver\") and a $5,500,000 development line of credit (the \"Line of Credit\"). The Revolver included amounts available for letters of credit of up to $1,000,000 and an uncommitted additional amount of $2,500,000. All outstanding principal and interest on the Revolver was due on February 28, 2022.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Facilities (as amended, the “2022 Credit Facility”) with the Lender. Under the 2022 Credit Facility, the Revolver increased to $20,000,000 (from $2,000,000), the portion of the Revolver available for letters of credit increased to $5,000,000 (from $1,000,000), the uncommitted additional amount increased to $30,000,000 (from $2,500,000) and the developmental Line of Credit of $5,500,000 was terminated. The Revolver will be used for working capital needs, general corporate purposes and for acquisitions, development and capital improvement uses. At the option of the Company, borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility bear interest at: (i) the adjusted SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus 1.75%, payable on the last day of the selected interest period of one, three or six months and on the three-month anniversary of the beginning of any six-month interest period, if applicable; or (ii) an Alternative Base Rate (ABR), plus 1.00%, payable monthly. The ABR is the greatest of (A) the prime rate (as published by the Wall Street Journal); (B) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate, plus 0.5%; and (C) the adjusted one-month term SOFR rate. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver on February 28, 2022 continued to bear interest at the rate selected under the Credit Facilities prior to the amendment until the last day of the interest period in effect, at which time, if not repaid, the amounts outstanding under the Revolver will bear interest at the 2022 Credit Facility rate. As a result of this refinance, $2,000,000 of current maturity of long-term debt was reclassified to long-term as of December 31, 2021. The 2022 Credit Facility will terminate and all principal and interest will become due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the amendment, which will occur on February 28, 2027. On January 17, 2024, the Company paid down the outstanding balance on its Debt under the Credit Agreement of $2,000,000.\n\nThe Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violations of covenants, certain bankruptcies and liquidations, cross-default to material indebtedness, certain material judgments, and certain fundamental changes such as a merger or sale of substantially all assets (as further defined in the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets, including the assets in the Company’s company-owned or managed clinics. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, and there is no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNote 8: Stock-Based Compensation\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nThe Company grants stock-based awards under its Amended and Restated 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The shares issued as a result of stock-based compensation transactions generally have been funded with the issuance of new shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company may grant the following types of incentive awards under the 2014 Plan: (i) non-qualified stock options; (ii) incentive stock options; (iii) stock appreciation rights; (iv) restricted stock; and (v) restricted stock units. Each award granted under the 2014 Plan is subject to an award agreement that incorporates, as applicable, the exercise price, the term of the award, the periods of restriction, the number of shares to which the award pertains and such other terms and conditions as the plan committee determines. Awards granted under the 2014 Plan are classified as equity awards, which are recorded in stockholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has granted under the 2014 Plan (i) non-qualified stock options; (ii) incentive stock options; and (iii) restricted stock. There were no stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units granted under the 2014 Plan as of September 30, 2024.\n\nStock Options\n\nThe Company’s closing price on the date of grant is the basis of fair value of its common stock used in determining the value of share-based awards. To the extent the value of the Company’s share-based awards involves a measure of volatility, the Company uses available historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a period of time corresponding to the expected stock option term. The Company historically has used the simplified method to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as the Company did not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. Accordingly, the expected life of the options granted is based on the average of the vesting term, which is generally four years and the contractual term, which is generally ten years. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of utilizing such method. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding to the expected stock option term. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical and forecasted turnover, which is approximately 5%.\n\nThe Company did not grant options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe information below summarizes the stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nNumber ofShares| WeightedAverageExercisePrice| WeightedAverageRemainingContractual Life(Years)  \n---|---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023| 486,334 | $| 8.88 | 3.7  \nGranted| — | —  \nExercised| (6,335)| 8.22  \nForfeited| (2,675)| 37.11  \nExpired| (4,619)| 25.87  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024| 472,705 | $| 8.56 | 2.9  \nExercisable at September 30, 2024| 465,930 | $| 7.99 | 2.8  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense for stock options was $38,608 and $85,366, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense for stock options was $140,383 and $235,972, respectively.\n\nRestricted Stock\n\nRestricted stock granted to employees generally vests in four equal annual installments, although on March 5, 2024, the Company granted 29,454 shares of restricted stock as part of a special award to certain executive employees that vest in one installment on the first anniversary of the grant. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors typically vests in full one year after the date of grant.\n\nThe information below summarizes the restricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nRestricted Stock Awards| Shares| Weighted AverageGrant-Date FairValue per Award  \n---|---|---  \nNon-vested at December 31, 2023| 231,901 | $| 17.32  \nGranted| 243,185 | 9.83  \nVested| (107,017)| 16.13  \nForfeited| (41,815)| 14.82  \nNon-vested at September 30, 2024| 326,254 | $| 12.45  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock was $391,642 and $440,703, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock was $1,335,327 and $973,324, respectively.\n\nNote 9: Income Taxes\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and income tax benefit of $0.2 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to change in valuation allowance. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to nondeductible meals and entertainment, change in valuation allowance, and state taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences, discrete items and state taxes.\n\nNote 10: Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLeases\n\nThe table below summarizes the components of lease expense and income statement location for the three and ninemonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nLine Items in the Company's Condensed Consolidated| Three Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---|---  \nIncome Statements| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nFinance lease costs:  \nAmortization of assets| Depreciation and amortization| $| 7,570 | $| 7,570 | $| 22,710 | $| 22,709  \nInterest on lease liabilities| Other income (expense), net| 499 | 760 | 1,686 | 2,473  \nTotal finance lease costs| 8,069 | 8,330 | 24,396 | 25,182  \nOperating lease costs| General and administrative expenses| 797,102 | 1,633,469 | 2,476,377 | 4,910,181  \nTotal lease costs| $| 805,171 | $| 1,641,799 | $| 2,500,773 | $| 4,935,363  \n  \n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nSupplemental information and balance sheet location related to leases (excluding amounts related to leases classified as held for sale) was as follows:September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nOperating Leases:  \nOperating lease right-of -use asset| $7,727,105| $12,413,221  \nOperating lease liability - current portion| $3,222,887| $3,756,328  \nOperating lease liability - net of current portion| 6,157,147| 10,914,997  \nTotal operating lease liability| $9,380,034| $14,671,325  \nFinance Leases:  \nProperty and equipment, at cost| $151,389| $151,396  \nLess accumulated amortization| (140,635)| (117,932)  \nProperty and equipment, net| $10,754| $33,464  \nFinance lease liability - current portion| 26,312| 25,491  \nFinance lease liability - net of current portion| 18,172| 38,016  \nTotal finance lease liabilities| $44,484| $63,507  \nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years):  \nOperating leases| 4.6| 4.8  \nFinance lease| 1.7| 2.4  \nWeighted average discount rate:  \nOperating leases| 5.3 | %| 5.4 | %  \nFinance leases| 4.3 | %| 4.3 | %  \n  \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2024| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases| $| 2,945,217 | $| 5,263,092  \nOperating cash flows from finance leases| 1,686 | 2,473  \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases| 19,013 | 18,227  \nNon-cash transactions: ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities  \nOperating lease| $| 2,049,597 | $| 4,287,622  \nFinance lease| — | —  \n  \n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are as follows, excluding amounts related to leases classified as held for sale:Operating Leases| Finance Lease  \n---|---  \n2024 (remainder)| $| 932,730 | $| 6,900  \n2025| 3,584,268 | 27,600  \n2026| 2,019,667 | 11,500  \n2027| 1,735,137 | —  \n2028| 1,118,433 | —  \nThereafter| 1,139,140 | —  \nTotal lease payments| $| 10,529,375 | $| 46,000  \nLess: Imputed interest| (1,149,341)| (1,516)  \nTotal lease obligations| 9,380,034 | 44,484  \nLess: Current obligations| (3,222,887)| (26,312)  \nLong-term lease obligation| $| 6,157,147 | $| 18,172  \n  \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company held an operating lease that has not yet commenced for space to be used by the Company’s new corporate clinic. The lease is expected to result in additional ROU assets and liabilities of approximately $0.6 million. This lease is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2024, with a lease term of ten years.\n\nGuarantee in Connection with the Sale of the Divested Business\n\nIn connection with the sale of a company-managed clinic in 2022, the Company guaranteed one future operating lease commitment assumed by the buyers. The Company is obligated to perform under the guarantee if the buyers fail to perform under the lease agreement at any time during the remainder of the lease agreement, which expires on May 31, 2027. At the date of sale, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments totaled $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the undiscounted remaining lease payments under the agreement totaled $0.1 million. The Company had not recorded a liability with respect to the guarantee obligation as of September 30, 2024, as the Company concluded that payment under the lease guarantee was not probable.\n\nLitigation\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to litigation and claims from time to time. The Company maintains insurance to cover certain litigation and claims. \n\nDuring Q2 2024, the Company entered into settlement agreements from litigation related to employment matters of $1.5 million that was outside the normal course of business. Additionally, ongoing litigation related to a medical injury claim between a patient (\"the Claimant\") and the Company filed on September 5, 2023 has progressed to mediation. Although the Company intends to defend the claims vigorously, the Claimant and the Company recently agreed to participate in non-binding mediation of their dispute before a neutral mediator. At this time, the mediation process between the Claimants and the Company is ongoing with a range of possible settlement outcomes between $0.9 million and $6.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued $0.9 million as an estimate of settlement costs related to the matter. The expense from the accrual is fully offset by a receivable recorded as the estimated settlement is within the Company's insurance plan.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred litigation expenses, including settlement costs related to employment matters and a medical injury claim that were outside the normal course of business of $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, included as general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated income statement.\n\nNote 11: Segment Reporting\n\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. The Company has identified its CODM as the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nThe Company has two operating business segments and one non-operating business segment. The Corporate Clinics segment is composed of the operating activities of the company-owned or managed clinics. As of September 30, 2024, the Company operated or managed 125 clinics under this segment. The Franchise Operations segment is composed of the operating activities of the franchise business unit. As of September 30, 2024, the franchise system consisted of 838 clinics in operation. Corporate is a non-operating segment that develops and implements strategic initiatives and supports the Company’s two operating business segments by centralizing key administrative functions such as finance and treasury, information technology, insurance and risk management, legal and human resources. Corporate also provides the necessary administrative functions to support the Company as a publicly-traded company. A portion of the expenses incurred by Corporate are allocated to the operating segments.\n\nThe following tables present financial information for the Company’s two operating business segments.\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenues:  \nCorporate clinics| $| 17,544,658 | $| 17,882,303 | $| 52,730,898 | $| 52,813,098  \nFranchise operations| 12,653,832 | 11,591,646 | 37,450,319 | 34,268,855  \nTotal revenues| $| 30,198,490 | $| 29,473,949 | $| 90,181,217 | $| 87,081,953  \nDepreciation and amortization:  \nCorporate clinics| $| 923,073 | $| 2,067,803 | $| 3,238,919 | $| 6,027,561  \nFranchise operations| 239,364 | 190,867 | 692,678 | 597,557  \nCorporate administration| 76,796 | 90,536 | 235,355 | 268,411  \nTotal depreciation and amortization| $| 1,239,233 | $| 2,349,206 | $| 4,166,952 | $| 6,893,529  \nSegment operating income (loss):  \nCorporate clinics| $| (2,722,741)| $| (931,366)| $| (1,484,746)| $| (1,331,630)  \nFranchise operations| 5,589,315 | 5,139,006 | 14,865,430 | 13,913,150  \nTotal segment operating income| $| 2,866,574 | $| 4,207,640 | $| 13,380,684 | $| 12,581,520  \nReconciliation of total segment operating income to consolidated loss before income taxes:  \nTotal segment operating income| $| 2,866,574 | $| 4,207,640 | $| 13,380,684 | $| 12,581,520  \nUnallocated corporate| (6,052,461)| (5,105,687)| (18,974,281)| (14,507,231)  \nConsolidated loss from operations| (3,185,887)| (898,047)| (5,593,597)| (1,925,711)  \nOther income (expense), net| 83,333 | (6,244)| 198,873 | 3,708,399  \n(Loss) income before income tax expense| $| (3,102,554)| $| (904,291)| $| (5,394,724)| $| 1,782,688  \n  \n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nSegment assets:  \nCorporate clinics| $| 42,306,186 | $| 52,210,617  \nFranchise operations| 11,704,033| 10,521,582  \nTotal segment assets| 54,010,219| 62,732,199  \nUnallocated cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| 21,995,436| 19,214,292  \nUnallocated property and equipment| 570,390| 2,843,491  \nOther unallocated assets| 3,022,777| 2,360,877  \nTotal assets| $| 79,598,822 | $| 87,150,859  \n  \n“Unallocated cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash” relates primarily to corporate cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), “unallocated property and equipment” relates primarily to corporate fixed assets and “other unallocated assets” relates primarily to deposits, prepaid and other assets.\n\nNote 12: Employee Retention Credit\n\nThe employee retention credit (“ERC”), as originally enacted through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) on March 27, 2020, is a refundable credit against certain employment taxes equal to 50% of the qualified wages an eligible employer paid to employees from March 17, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The Disaster Tax Relief Act, enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the ERC for qualified wages paid from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and the credit was increased to 70% of qualified wages an eligible employer paid to employees during the extended period. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, further extended the ERC through December 31, 2021.\n\nIn October 2022, the Company filed an application with the Internal Revenue Services (the “IRS”) for the ERC. Employers are eligible for the credit if they experienced full or partial suspension or modification of operations during any calendar quarter because of governmental orders due to the pandemic or a significant decline in gross receipts based on a comparison of quarterly revenue results for 2020 and/or 2021 with the comparable quarter in 2019. The Company’s ERC application was equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees during the period from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 for a maximum quarterly credit of $7,000 per employee. In March 2023, the Company received notice and refunds from the IRS related to the overpayment of Federal Employment Tax plus interest in the amount of $4.8 million related to the ERC application. The $4.8 million ERC is subject to a 20% consulting fee. The Company’s eligibility remains subject to audit by the IRS for a period of five years.\n\nSince there are no generally accepted accounting principles for for-profit business entities that receive government assistance that is not in the form of a loan, an income tax credit or revenue from a contract with a customer, the Company determined the appropriate accounting treatment by analogy to other guidance. The Company accounted for the ERC by analogy to International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, of International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nUnder an IAS 20 analogy, a business entity would recognize the ERC on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes the payroll expenses for which the grant (i.e., tax credit) is intended to compensate when there is reasonable assurance (i.e., it is probable) that the entity will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and the grant (i.e., tax credit) will be received.\n\nThe Company accounted for the $3.8 million ERC, net of the consulting fee, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as other income on the Statement of Income when the Company was reasonably assured that it met all requirements of the ERC and the grant would be received. The ERC refund is not taxable; however, the credit is subject to expense disallowance rules which increased income tax expense as a discrete item by $0.9 million, net of the consulting expense deduction, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNote 13: Related Party Transactions\n\nMr. Jefferson Gramm, Managing Partner of Bandera Partners LLC who is a beneficial holder of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock (approximately 26% as of September 30, 2024) was appointed to the Board of Directors effective as of January 2, 2024.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nIn December 2020, we sold two franchise licenses at $39,900 and $29,900 each (which reflects the $10,000 multi-unit discount for the second license per the Franchise Disclosure Document) to Marshall Gramm, who is a family member of Mr. Jefferson Gramm. In April 2020 and 2021, we sold two franchise licenses at $39,900 and $29,900, respectively (which reflects the $10,000 multi-unit discount for the second license per the Franchise Disclosure Document), to a franchisee of which Mr. Jefferson Gramm is a 50% co-partner in the business.\n\nThese transactions involved terms no less favorable to us than those that would have been obtained in the absence of such affiliation. Although we have no way of estimating the aggregate amount of franchise fees, royalties, advertising fund fees, IT related income and computer software fees that these franchisees will pay over the life of the franchise licenses, the franchisees affiliated with Mr. Gramm are subject to such fees under the same terms and conditions as all other franchisees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these franchisees affiliated with Mr. Gramm paid $34,215 and $31,087, respectively, for such royalties and other fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these franchisees affiliated with Mr. Gramm paid $102,080 and $89,607, respectively, for such royalties and other fees.\n\nIn October 2020, Mr. Gramm loaned approximately $370,000 to an unaffiliated franchisee that owns and operates one franchise clinic. The loan is not secured by the assets of the business and there are no foreclosure rights. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining balance on the unsecured loan was $270,800.\n\nAs of the three months ended September 30, 2024, as presented on the face of the balance sheet at September 30, 2024, the Company owes Mr. Gramm $375,000. The payable is a result of professional service costs incurred by the Company and initially paid by Mr. Gramm during the confidential chief executive search. These costs were fully reimbursed to Mr. Gramm on October 31, 2024.\n\nNote 14: Subsequent Events \n\nResignation of Peter D. Holt\n\nEffective October 10, 2024, Peter D. Holt resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. In connection with Mr. Holt’s resignation, as of October 10, 2024, the Company and Mr. Holt entered into a confidential separation agreement and release of claims. In Q4 2024, the Company recorded an accrual of $0.6 million for payments that will be made as a result of the separation agreement through September 2025.\n\nAppointment of Sanjiv Razdan as President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nEffective October 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Sanjiv Razdan as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. \n\nIn connection with Mr. Razdan’s appointment, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Razdan, effective as of October 14, 2024 (the “Employment Agreement”). Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Razdan is entitled to an annual base salary of $550,000 (subject to annual review by the Company’s Board of Directors or a committee thereof). Mr. Razdan is also eligible to participate in the Company’s executive compensation programs, to receive a discretionary annual bonus as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors or a committee thereof, and to receive annual and periodic stock-based compensation awards as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Mr. Razdan is entitled to receive other standard benefits, participation in any group insurance, pension, retirement, vacation, expense reimbursement, relocation program (as applicable), and other plans, programs, and benefits approved by the Company’s Board of Directors or a committee thereof and made available from time to time to other executive employees of the Company, and certain insurance benefits.\n\nMr. Razdan is entitled to a monthly travel and living allowance of $2,000 and to severance benefits upon certain termination events.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, the Company also entered into a Stock Option Agreement and a Restricted Stock Award Agreement with Mr. Razdan providing awards of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Award with an aggregate value of $800,000 on the date of grant. The awards qualify as “inducement grants” under rules of the Nasdaq stock exchange and are in addition to future annual grants that Mr. Razdan may receive under the terms of the Employment Agreement and the Company’s existing 2024 Incentive Stock Plan.\n\nOngoing litigation\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nOn October 22, 2024, the Company entered into mediation on ongoing litigation related to a medical injury claim filed by Claimant on September 5, 2023. Although the Company intends to defend the claims vigorously, the Claimant and the Company agreed to participate in non-binding mediation of their dispute before a neutral mediator. At this time, the mediation process between the Claimants and the Company is ongoing with a range of possible settlement outcomes between $0.9 million and $6.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued $0.9 million as an estimate of settlement costs related to the matter. The expense from the accrual is fully offset by a receivable recorded as the estimated settlement is within the Company's insurance plan.\n\nRepayment of related party accounts payable\n\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company paid down the $375,000 in accounts payable due to related parties (See Note 13, Related Party Transactions) on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The payable is a result of professional service costs incurred by the Company and initially paid by Mr. Gramm during the confidential chief executive search.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024.\n\nOverview\n\nOur principal business is to develop, own, operate, support and manage chiropractic clinics through direct ownership, management arrangements, franchising and regional developers throughout the United States.\n\nWe seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic care in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry through the rapid and focused expansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and potentially abroad.\n\nKey Performance Measures. We receive monthly performance reports from our system and our clinics that include key performance indicators per clinic, including gross sales, comparable same-store sales growth, or “Comp Sales,” number of new patients, conversion percentage and membership attrition. In addition, we review monthly reporting related to system-wide sales, clinic openings, clinic license sales, adjusted EBITDA and various earnings metrics in the aggregate and per clinic. We believe these indicators provide us with useful data with which to measure our performance and to measure our franchisees’ and clinics’ performance. Comp Sales include the sales from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. System-wide sales include sales at all clinics, whether operated by us or by franchisees. While franchised clinic sales are not recorded as revenues by us, management believes the information is important in understanding the overall brand’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related expenses (which includes contract termination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), stock-based compensation expense, bargain purchase gain, (gain) loss on disposition or impairment, costs related to restatement filings, restructuring costs, litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related fees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business) and other income related to the ERC. There were no costs related to bargain purchase gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\nKey Clinic Development Trends. As of September 30, 2024, we and our franchisees operated or managed 963 clinics, of which 838 were operated or managed by franchisees and 125 were operated as company-owned or managed clinics. Of the 125 company-owned or managed clinics, 58 were constructed and developed by us, and 67 were acquired from franchisees.\n\nOur current strategy is to grow through the sale and development of additional franchises. After evaluating options for improvement, during 2023 the board authorized management to initiate a plan to re-franchise or sell the majority of our company-owned or managed clinics. During Q3 2024, the Company expanded the re-franchising plan to include the full portfolio of company-owned and company-managed clinics, marketing the clinics in clusters grouped by proximity to larger private equity firms. This refined strategy will leverage our greatest strength - our capacity to build a franchise - to drive long-term growth for both our franchisees and The Joint as a public company. We have created a robust framework for the re-franchising effort, \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\norganizing clinics into clusters, and generating comprehensive disclosure packets for marketing efficiency. We have given initial preference to existing franchisees and in Q3 2024 have expanded the marketing efforts to larger private equity firms interested in purchasing and operating large market-based clinic clusters and have received significant interest to date in most markets. Our goal will be to generate significant processes that will provide us with value creating capital allocation opportunities. These opportunities could include, but are not limited to, reinvestment in the brand and related marketing, continued investment in our IT platforms, the repurchase of RD territories, and/or a stock repurchase program.\n\nThe number of franchise licenses sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 55, compared with 75 and 156 licenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We ended the first nine months in 2024 with 16 regional developers who were responsible for 38% of the 29 licenses sold during the period. This strong result reflects the power of the regional developer program to accelerate the number of clinics sold, and eventually opened, across the United States.\n\nWe believe that we continue to have a sound business concept and will benefit from the fundamental changes taking place in the manner in which Americans access chiropractic care and their growing interest in seeking effective, affordable natural solutions for general wellness. These trends join with the preference we have seen among chiropractic doctors to reject the insurance-based model to produce a combination that benefits the consumer and the service provider alike. We believe that these forces create an important opportunity to accelerate the growth of our network.\n\nRecent Events\n\nRecent events that may impact our business include unfavorable global economic or political conditions, such as the Ukraine War, the Israel-Gaza conflict, labor shortages, and inflation and other cost increases. We anticipate that 2024 will continue to be a volatile macroeconomic environment. \n\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs. In 2023 and 2024, clinics company-owned or managed by us were negatively impacted by labor shortages and wage increases, which increased our general and administrative expenses. Further, should we fail to continue to increase our wages competitively in response to increasing wage rates, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our patient service to suffer. While we anticipate that these continued headwinds will be partially mitigated by pricing actions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to take such pricing actions. A continued increase in labor costs could have an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, the increase in interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will continue to remain elevated may adversely affect patients’ financial conditions, resulting in reduced spending on our services. While the impact of these factors continues to remain uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These and other uncertainties with respect to these recent events could result in changes to our current expectations.\n\nOther Significant Events and/or Recent Developments\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period:\n\n•System-wide comp sales of clinics that have been open for at least 13 full months increased 4%.\n\n•System-wide comp sales for mature clinics open 48 months or more decreased (2)%.\n\n•System-wide sales for all clinics open for any amount of time increased 8%.\n\nOn June 24, 2024, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we repurchased the right to develop franchises in various counties in Maryland. The total consideration for the transaction was $0.6 million. We carried an upfront regional developer fee liability balance associated with this transaction of $0.1 million, representing the unrecognized fee collected upon the execution of the regional developer agreement. We accounted for the termination of development rights associated with unsold or undeveloped franchises as a cancellation, and the associated upfront regional developer fee liability was netted against the aggregate purchase price. We recognized the net amount of $0.5 million as a general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEffective October 10, 2024, Peter D. Holt resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nEffective October 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Sanjiv Razdan as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\n\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new clinic sales, openings, closures, markets in which they are contained and related expenses, general economic conditions, cost inflation, labor shortages, consumer confidence in the economy, consumer preferences, competitive factors, and disease epidemics and other health-related concerns.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThere were no changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those set forth in “Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial results encompasses our consolidated results and results of our two business segments: Corporate Clinics and Franchise Operations. \n\nTotal Revenues - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nComponents of revenues were as follows:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023| Change fromPrior Year| Percent Changefrom Prior Year  \nRevenues:  \nRevenues from company-owned or managed clinics| $| 17,544,658 | $| 17,882,303 | $| (337,645)| (1.9)| %  \nRoyalty fees| 7,870,033 | 7,143,791 | 726,242 | 10.2 | %  \nFranchise fees| 697,688 | 754,029 | (56,341)| (7.5)| %  \nAdvertising fund revenue| 2,247,663 | 2,050,106 | 197,557 | 9.6 | %  \nIT related income and software fees| 1,431,321 | 1,301,577 | 129,744 | 10.0 | %  \nOther revenues| 407,127 | 342,143 | 64,984 | 19.0 | %  \nTotal revenues| $| 30,198,490 | $| 29,473,949 | $| 724,541 | 2.5 | %  \n  \nConsolidated Results\n\nTotal revenues increased by $0.7 million, primarily due to the continued expansion and revenue growth of our franchise base.\n\nCorporate Clinics\n\nRevenues from company-owned or managed clinics decreased, primarily due to the divestitures of our company-owned or managed clinics in 2024.

There were no costs related to restatement filings or bargain purchase gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We have provided Adjusted EBITDA because it is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance commonly used for comparing companies in our industry. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for operating profit as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from other companies. \n\nWe believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other outpatient medical clinics, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and short-term bank deposits of $20.7 million and $20 million of available capacity under the Line of Credit. While unfavorable global economic or political conditions create potential liquidity risks, as discussed further below, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, our anticipated cash flows from investments as we execute our re-franchising strategy and amounts available under our Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and investment needs for at least the next 12 months. \n\nWhile the interruptions, delays and/or cost increases resulting from, political instability and geopolitical tensions, economic weakness, inflationary pressures, increase in interest rates and other factors have created uncertainty as to general economic conditions for 2024 and beyond, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to use or redeploy our cash resources to support our business within the context of prevailing market conditions, which, given the ongoing uncertainties described above, could rapidly and materially deteriorate or otherwise change. Our long-term capital requirements could be dependent on our ability to access additional funds through the debt and/or equity markets. If the equity or debt markets deteriorate, including as a result of economic weakness, political unrest or war, or any other reason, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner and on favorable terms, if at all, and if obtained, it \n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nmay be more costly or more dilutive. From time to time, we consider and evaluate transactions related to our portfolio and capital structure, including debt financings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, and other transactions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain the capital necessary to meet our short and long-term capital requirements. \n\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $6.0 million to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt of the $4.8 million ERC in the prior period, in addition to an increase in general and administrative expenses over the prior year period.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.5 million and $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this included proceeds from sales of clinics of $0.4 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $0.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, this included acquisitions of $1.1 million, and the purchases of property and equipment of $3.8 million.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.0 million, compared to $0.2 million in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this included paying down the outstanding balance on its Debt under the Credit Agreement of $2.0 million.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements that may impact our financial statements.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk appearing in Part II, Item 7(a), “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving such objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nInformation regarding our legal proceedings is discussed in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nWe documented our risk factors in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since the filing of that Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of our company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (in each case, defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#i58a1b13232df46f492a8873f34ec9faa_7)\n\nITEM 6.

All statements, other\nthan statements of historical facts, included or incorporated in this Form 10-K could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and\nprospects under the headings “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In some cases, you can identify forward-\nlooking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,”\n“intend,” “seek,” “strive,” or the negative of these terms, “mission,” “goal,” “objective,” or “strategy,” or other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements in this\nForm 10-K are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions, and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to\ndiffer materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, uncertainties and risks that\ncould affect our future results or operations as described from time to time in our SEC reports, including those risks outlined under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThese factors, uncertainties and risks may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement set forth in this Form 10-K. You should carefully consider\nthe trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment\ndecision with respect to our securities. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, other than in accordance with legal and regulatory\nobligations. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nThe specific forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include the following:\nour mission to improve quality of life through routine and affordable chiropractic care;\nthat we seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic care in the

our franchise base through the sale of additional franchises and through the continued support of our robust\nregional developer network;\nour belief that our approach, especially our commitment to affordable pricing and our ready service delivery model, will attract existing consumers of chiropractic services and will\nalso appeal to the growing market of consumers who seek alternative or non-invasive wellness care, but have not yet tried chiropractic;\nour belief that we are a key driver in expanding the overall market for chiropractic;\nour belief that the demand for our chiropractic services will continue to grow as a result of several additional drivers, such as the growing recognition of the benefits of regular\nmaintenance therapy coupled with an increasing awareness of the convenience of our service and of our pricing at a significant discount to the cost of traditional chiropractic\nadjustments and, in most cases, at or below the level of insurance co-payment amounts;\nour belief that certain characteristics of the chiropractic industry are evidence of an underserved market with potential consumer demand that is favorable for an efficient, low-cost,\nconsumer-oriented provider;\nour belief that certain industry and cultural trends favor our business model;\nour belief that our competitive strengths have contributed to our success and will continue to position us for future growth;\nour intention to continue to drive awareness of our brand by continuing to locate clinics mainly at retail centers and convenience points, displaying prominent signage and employing\nconsistent, proven and targeted marketing tools;\nTable of Contents\nour belief that the time our chiropractors save by not having to perform administrative duties related to insurance reimbursement allows more time to see more patients, establish\nand reinforce chiropractor/patient relationships, and educate patients on the benefits of chiropractic maintenance therapy;\nour belief that our model helps us to recruit chiropractors who want to focus their practice principally on patient care;\nour belief that our strongest competitive advantages are our convenience and affordability;\nour belief that our pricing and service offering structure helps us to generate higher usage;\nour belief that as the leader in the vertical, and as one of few players of scale, we occupy an advantageous position in an otherwise highly fragmented market;\nour commitment to the continued strengthening of operations, the continued cultivation and management of our franchise community, as well as a strong commitment to future clinic\ndevelopment both domestically and internationally;\nour belief that our management team’s experience and demonstrated success in

important to gain brand equity and consumer awareness as rapidly as\npossible, consistent with a disciplined approach to opening clinics;\nour belief that continued sales of franchises in selected markets is the most effective way to drive brand awareness in the short term;\nour plan to continue to support our franchisees and regional developers to open clinics and to achieve sustainable performance as rapidly as possible;\nour expectation to drive greater efficiencies across our operations, development and marketing programs and further leverage our technology and existing support infrastructure;\nour belief that we will be able to control corporate costs over time to enhance margins as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our clinic base and sales;\nour expectation, at the clinic level, to drive margins and labor efficiencies through continued sales growth and consistently applied operating standards as our clinic base matures\nand the average number of patient visits increases;\nour continued consideration of introducing selected and complementary branded products such as nutraceuticals or dietary supplements and related additional services;\nour expectation that the regulatory focus on privacy, security and data use issues will continue to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal\ninformation will expand and become more complex;\nour belief that our operations comply with legally required standards for privacy and security of personal information to the extent applicable under federal or state law, and we\nstrive to comply with additional standards that we identify as \"best practices\";\nour expectations of the various risks and uncertainties for our business related to potential state and federal regulations;\nour expectation that that other direct competitors will join our industry as our visibility, reputation and perceived advantages become more widely known;\nTable of Contents\nour belief that our first mover advantage, proprietary operations systems and strong unit level economics will continue to accelerate our growth even with the spawning of additional\ncompetition;\nour commitment to fostering a workplace where our employees feel aligned with our mission, proud of our culture and engaged in their work, with opportunities to grow and develop\nin their careers, supported by competitive compensation and benefits;\nour belief that our employees are among our most valuable resources and are critical to our continued success;\nour expectation that we will not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future;\nour current strategy to grow through the sale and development of additional franchises;\nour plan to re-franchise or sell the majority of our company-owned or managed clinics, which refined strategy will leverage our greatest strength - our capacity to build a franchise -\nto drive long-term growth for both our franchisees and The Joint as a public company;\nour goal to generate significant proceeds that will provide us with value creating capital allocation opportunities, which opportunities could include reinvestment in the brand and\nrelated marketing, continued investment in our IT platforms, the repurchase of RD territory, and/or a stock repurchase program;\nour belief that we have a sound business concept and will benefit from the fundamental changes taking place in the manner in which Americans access chiropractic care and their\ngrowing interest in seeking effective, affordable natural solutions for general wellness, and our belief that these trends jointed with the preference among chiropractic doctors to\nreject the insurance-based model create an important opportunity to accelerate the growth of our network;\nour expectation that 2024 will continue to be a volatile macroeconomic environment;\nour expectation that the sale of two of our company-owned or managed clinics will close during the first quarter of 2024 and our plan to re-franchise or sell the majority of our\ncompany-owned or managed clinics will leverage our greatest strength – our capacity to build a franchise – to drive long-term growth for both our franchisees and The Joint as a\npublic company;\nour belief that we have created a robust framework for the re-franchising effort, organizing clinics into clusters, and generating comprehensive disclosure packets for marketing\nefficiency, and that we have received significant interest to date from our existing franchisees;\nour belief that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations and amounts available under our development line of credit will be sufficient to\nfund our anticipated operating and investment needs for at least the next 12 months;\nour belief as of the date of this Form 10-K, that we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably\nanticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business;\nour expectation for 2024 that we will use or redeploy our cash resources to support our business within the context of prevailing market conditions, which, given the ongoing\nuncertainties described herein, could rapidly and materially deteriorate or otherwise change; and\nour belief that our long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate initiatives, could be dependent on our ability to access additional funds through the\ndebt and/or equity markets.\nSome of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\nthe nationwide labor shortage has negatively impacted our ability to recruit chiropractors and other qualified personnel, which may limit our growth strategy, and the measures we\nhave taken in response to the labor shortage have reduced our net revenues;\nTable of Contents\ninflation has led to increased labor costs and interest rates and may lead to reduced discretionary spending, all of which may negatively impact our business;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to our operations and may continue to impact our business, key financial and operating metrics, and results of operations\nin numerous ways that remain unpredictable; future widespread outbreaks of contagious disease could similarly disrupt our business;\nwe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we or our franchisees are unable to locate and secure appropriate sites for clinic locations, obtain favorable\nlease terms and attract patients to our clinics;\nwe have limited experience operating company-owned or managed clinics in those geographic areas where we currently have few or no clinics, and we may not be able to duplicate\nthe success of some of our franchisees;\nwe have restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our\nstock price;\nshort-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet may drive down the market price of our common stock and could result in class action lawsuits;\nwe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, and we may fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial\nreporting or may otherwise be unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, which might negatively impact our ability to accurately report our\nfinancial results, prevent fraud or maintain investor confidence;\nwe may fail to successfully design and maintain our proprietary and third-party management information systems or implement new systems;\nwe may fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement, upgrade or consolidate existing information systems;\nwe may not be able to continue to sell franchises to qualified franchisees, and our franchisees may not succeed in developing profitable territories and clinics;\nnew clinics may not reach the point of profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or improve revenues and franchise fees from existing franchised clinics;\nthe chiropractic industry is highly competitive, with many well-established independent competitors, which could prevent us from increasing our market share or result in reduction\nin our market share;\nstate administrative actions and rulings regarding the corporate practice of chiropractic may jeopardize our business model;\nexpected new federal regulations and state laws and regulations regarding joint employer responsibility could negatively impact the franchise business model, increasing our\npotential liability for employment law violations by our franchisees and the likelihood that we may be required to participate in collective bargaining with our franchisees’\nemployees;\nan increased regulatory focus on the establishment of fair franchise practices could increase our risk of liability in disputes with franchisees and the risk of enforcement actions and\npenalties;\nnegative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns expressed by opponents of chiropractic and by chiropractors operating under traditional service\nmodels, could adversely impact our operations and financial position;\nour IT security systems and those of our third-party service providers (as recently experienced by one of our marketing vendors) may be breached, and we may face civil liability and\npublic perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients;\nTable of Contents\nlegislation and regulations, as well as new medical procedures and techniques, could reduce or eliminate our competitive advantages; and\nthe delayed filing of our quarterly report has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could\nadversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAdditionally, there may be other risks that are otherwise described from time to time in the reports that we file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K\nshould be considered in light of various important factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed above, as well as others.\nTerminology\nAs used in this Form 10-K:\n“we,” “us,” “our” and \"our company\" refer to The Joint Corp., its variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Joint Corporate Unit No. 1, LLC,\ncollectively;\na “clinic” refers to a chiropractic clinic operating under our “Joint” brand, which may be (i) owned by a franchisee, (ii) owned by a professional corporation or limited liability\ncompany and managed by a franchisee; (iii) owned directly by us; or (iv) owned by a professional corporation or limited liability company and managed by us;\nwhen we identify an “operator” of a clinic, a party that is “operating” a clinic or a party by whom a clinic is “operated,” we are referring to the party that operates all aspects of the\nclinic in certain jurisdictions, and to the party that manages all aspects of the clinic other than the practice of chiropractic in certain other jurisdictions;\nwhen we describe our opening of a clinic, we are referring to our opening of a clinic that is owned or managed by us from its inception.

BUSINESS\n\"Our mission is to improve\nquality of life through routine and\naffordable chiropractic care.\"\nOverview\nWe are a rapidly growing franchisor and operator of chiropractic clinics that uses a private pay, non-insurance, cash-based model. We seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic\ncare in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry. We delivered over 13.6 million patient visits in 2023, up from 12.2 million patient visits in\n2022, generating over $488.0 million and $435 million of system-wide sales, respectively, across our highly franchised network. We will continue the rapid and franchise focused\nexpansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and potentially abroad. We strive to accomplish our mission by making quality care readily available and\naffordable in a retail setting. We have created a growing network of modern, consumer-friendly chiropractic clinics operated or managed by franchisees and by us that employ\nlicensed chiropractors. Our model enables us to price our services below most competitors’ pricing for similar services and below most insurance co-payment levels (i.e., below the\npatient co-payment required for an insurance-covered service).\nSince acquiring the predecessor to our company in March 2010, we have grown our enterprise from eight to 935 clinics in operation as of December 31, 2023, with an additional 132\nfranchise licenses sold but not yet developed across our network, and 40 letters of intent for 40 future clinic licenses. As of December 31, 2023, our franchisees owned or managed\n800 clinics, and we owned or managed 135 clinics. Our future growth strategy will focus on accelerating the development of our franchise base through the sale of additional\nfranchises and through the continued support of our robust regional developer network. We collect a royalty of 7.0% of gross sales from franchised clinics. We remit a 3.0% royalty\nto our regional developers on the gross sales of franchises opened within certain regional developer protected territories. We also collect a national marketing fee of 2.0% of gross\nsales of all franchised clinics. We receive an initial franchise fee of $39,900 for each franchise we sell directly and offer a veterans discount, as well as a discount for purchase of\nmultiple location franchises. If a franchisee purchases additional franchise licenses, the initial franchise fee is reduced by $10,000 per additional license. For each franchise sold\nthrough our network of regional developers, the regional developer typically receives up to 50% of the respective franchise fee.\nOn November 14, 2014, we completed our initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial price to the public of $6.50 per share, and we received\nnet proceeds of approximately $17.1 million. Our underwriters exercised their option to purchase 450,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments on November\n18, 2014, pursuant to which we received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million. With the over-allotment option exercise, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately\n$19.8 million. Also, in conjunction with the IPO, we issued warrants to the underwriters for the purchase of 90,000 shares of common stock, which were exercisable during the period\nbetween November 10, 2015 and November 10, 2018 at an exercise price of $8.125 per share. These warrants expired on November 10, 2018.\nOn November 25, 2015, we closed on our follow-on public offering of 2,272,727 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $5.50 per share. We granted the underwriters a\n45-day option to purchase up to 340,909 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 30, 2015, our underwriters exercised their over-allotment\noption to purchase an additional 340,909 shares of common stock at a price of $5.50 per share. After giving effect to the over-allotment exercise, the total number of shares offered\nand sold in our follow-on public offering increased to 2,613,636 shares. With the over-allotment option exercise, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $13.3 million.\nWe deliver convenient, appointment-free chiropractic adjustments in an inviting, open bay environment at prices that are approximately 45% lower than the average industry cost for\ncomparable procedures offered by traditional chiropractors, according to 2023 industry data from Chiropractic Economics. In support of our mission to offer quality, affordable and\nconvenient care to our patients, our clinics offer a variety of customizable membership and wellness treatment plans, which provide additional value pricing as compared with our\nsingle-visit pricing schedules. These flexible plans are designed to attract patients and encourage repeat visits and routine usage as part of an overall health and wellness program.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 935 franchised or company-owned or managed clinics in operation in 41 states and the District of Columbia. The map below shows the states in\nwhich we or our franchisees manage or operate clinics and the number of clinics open in each state or district as of December 31, 2023.\n2\nTable of Contents\nOur retail locations have been selected to be visible, accessible and convenient. We offer a welcoming, consumer-friendly experience that attempts to redefine the chiropractic\ndoctor/patient relationship. Our clinics are open longer hours than many of our competitors, including weekend days, and our patients do not need appointments. We accept cash or\nmajor credit cards in return for our services. We do not accept insurance and do not provide Medicare covered services. We believe that our approach, especially our commitment to\naffordable pricing and our ready service delivery model, will attract existing consumers of chiropractic services and will also appeal to the growing market of consumers who seek\nalternative or non-invasive wellness care, but have not yet tried chiropractic. According to our patient survey conducted in early 2024 by WestGroup Research, 36% of our new\npatients had never tried chiropractic care before they came to The Joint. This remains consistent with the strong outcomes of 35% and 36% of patients new to chiropractic in the same\nsurvey conducted in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This is also an increase from 27% in 2021, 26% in 2019, 22% in 2017, 21% in 2016, and 16% in 2013, demonstrating our\ncontinued impact on the chiropractic market and offering validation to our thesis that we are a key driver in expanding the overall market for chiropractic.\nOur patients arrive at our clinics without appointments at times convenient to their schedules. Once a patient has joined our system and is returning for treatment, they simply swipe\ntheir membership card at a card reader at the reception desk to announce their arrival. The patient is then escorted to our open adjustment area, where they are required to remove\nonly their outerwear to receive their adjustment. Each patient’s records are digitally updated for retrieval in our proprietary data storage system by our chiropractors in compliance\nwith all applicable medical records security and privacy regulations. The adjustment process, administered by a licensed chiropractor, takes approximately 15 - 20 minutes on average\nfor a new patient and 5 - 7 minutes on average for a returning patient.\nOur consumer-focused service model targets the non-acute treatment market, which is part of the $20.5 billion chiropractic services market, according to an IBIS market research\nreport in November 2023. As our model does not focus on the treatment of severe or acute injury, we do not provide expensive and invasive diagnostic tools such as MRIs and X-\nrays. Instead, we refer those with severe or acute symptoms to alternate healthcare providers, including traditional chiropractors.\nOur Industry\nChiropractic care is widely accepted among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, particularly back pain. A 2018 Gallup report commissioned by Palmer College of\nChiropractic shows that among all U.S. adults, including those who did not have neck or\n3\nTable of Contents\nback pain, 16% went to a chiropractor in the last 12 months. These numbers represent a marked increase over the 2012 National Health Interview Survey that measured chiropractic\nuse at 8% of the population. According to the American Chiropractic Association, 80% of Americans experience back pain at least once in their lifetime. According to the same 2018\nGallup report commissioned by the Palmer College of Chiropractic, eight in 10 adults in the United States (80%) prefer to see a health care professional who is an expert in spine-\nrelated conditions for neck or back pain care instead of a general medicine professional who treats a variety of conditions (15%).\nChiropractic care is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for pain and potentially for a variety of other conditions. The American College of Physicians (the \"ACP\") now\nrecommends non-drug therapy such as spinal manipulation as a first line of treatment for patients with chronic low-back pain. The ACP states that treatments such as spinal\nmanipulation are shown to improve symptoms with little risk of harm. The National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has stated\nthat spinal manipulation appears to benefit some people with low-back pain and also may be helpful for headaches, neck pain, upper- and lower-extremity joint conditions and\nwhiplash-associated disorders. The Mayo Clinic has recognized chiropractic as safe when performed by trained and licensed chiropractors, and the Cleveland Clinic has stated that\nchiropractors are established members of the mainstream medical team.\nThe chiropractic industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. An article appearing in the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled “US Healthcare\nSpending by Payer and Health Condition, 1996-2016” estimates that $134 billion was spent in 2016 on back pain in the United States. According to a report issued by IBIS World\nChiropractors Market Research in November 2023, expenditures for chiropractic services in the U.S. are approximately $20.5 billion annually. The United States Bureau of Labor\nStatistics expects employment of chiropractors to grow nine percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations. Some of the factors that the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics identified as driving this growth are rising interest in integrative or complementary healthcare, which has led to more acceptance of chiropractic treatment of the back,\nneck, limbs, and involved joints; an aging population (specifically the continued aging of the large baby boomer generation) requiring more health care and technological advances;\nand the need to replace workers who exit the labor force through retirement. We believe that the demand for our chiropractic services will continue to grow as a result of several\nadditional drivers, such as the growing recognition of the benefits of regular maintenance therapy coupled with an increasing awareness of the convenience of our service and of our\npricing at a significant discount to the cost of traditional chiropractic adjustments and, in most cases, at or below the level of insurance co-payment amounts.\nToday, most chiropractic services are provided by sole practitioners, generally in medical office settings. The chiropractic industry differs from the broader healthcare services\nindustry in that it is more heavily consumer-driven, market-responsive and price sensitive, in large measure a result of many treatment options falling outside the bounds of\ntraditional insurance reimbursable services and fee schedules. According to the November 2023 IBIS market research report, the Top 50 largest industry practices accounted for only\n4% of total industry revenue. We believe these characteristics are evidence of an underserved market with potential consumer demand that is favorable for an efficient, low-cost,\nconsumer-oriented provider.\nMost chiropractic practices are set up to accept and to process insurance-based reimbursement. While chiropractors typically accept cash payment in addition to insurance, Medicare\nand Medicaid, they continue to incur overhead expenses associated with maintaining the capability to process third-party reimbursement. We believe that most chiropractors who use\nthis third-party reimbursement model would find it economically difficult to discount the prices they charge for their services to levels comparable with our pricing.\nAccordingly, we believe these and certain other trends favor our business model. Among these are:\n• People, most notably Millennials – the largest portion of our patient base – have increasingly active lifestyles and are expected to live longer, requiring more medical,\nmaintenance and preventative support;\n• People are increasingly open to alternative, non-pharmacological types of care;\n• Utilization of more conveniently situated, local-sited urgent-care or “mini-care” alternatives to primary care is increasing; and\n• Popularity of health clubs, massage and other non-drug, non-invasive wellness maintenance providers is growing.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe the following competitive strengths have contributed to our success and will continue to position us for future growth:\nRetail, consumer-driven approach. To support our consumer-focused model, we use strong, recognizable retail approaches to stimulate brand-awareness and attract patients to our\nclinics. We intend to continue to drive awareness of our brand by continuing to locate clinics mainly at retail centers and convenience points, displaying prominent signage and\nemploying consistent, proven and targeted marketing tools. We offer our patients the flexibility to visit our clinics without an appointment where they will receive\n4\nTable of Contents\nprompt attention. Additionally, most of our clinics offer extended hours of operation, including weekends, which is not typical among our competitors.\nWe attracted an average of 1,021 new patients per clinic (for all clinics open for the full 12 months of 2023) during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the most\nrecent chiropractic industry average of 380 new patients per year for traditional insurance-based non-multidisciplinary or integrated practices, according to a 2023 Chiropractic\nEconomics survey (published in June of 2023).\nQuality, Empathetic Service. Across our system we have a community of more than 2,591 fully licensed chiropractic doctors, who performed approximately 13.6 million adjustments\nin 2023 alone. Our doctors provide personal and intuitive patient care focused on pain relief and ongoing wellness to promote healthy, active lifestyles. We provide our doctors one-\non-one training, as well as ongoing coaching and mentoring. Our doctors continually refine their skills, as our clinics see an average of 305 patient visits per week (for clinics open\nfor the full 12 months of 2023), as compared to the most recent chiropractic industry average of 155 patients per week for non-multidisciplinary or integrated practices, according to\nthe same 2023 Chiropractic Economics survey referred to above. Our service offerings encourage consumer trial, repeat visits and sustainable patient relationships.\nBy eliminating the administrative burdens of insurance processing, our model helps chiropractors focus on patient service. We believe the time our chiropractors save by not having\nto perform administrative duties related to insurance reimbursement allows more time to see more patients, establish and reinforce chiropractor/patient relationships, and educate\npatients on the benefits of chiropractic maintenance therapy.\nOur approach has made us an attractive alternative for chiropractic doctors who want to spend more time treating patients than they typically do in traditional practices, which are\nburdened with greater overhead, personnel and administrative expense. We believe that our model helps us to recruit chiropractors who want to focus their practice principally on\npatient care.\nAccessibility. We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our convenience and affordability. By focusing on non-acute care in an open-bay environment and by not\nparticipating in insurance or Medicare reimbursement, we are able to offer a much less expensive alternative to traditional chiropractic services. We can do this because our clinics do\nnot have the expenses of performing certain diagnostic procedures and processing reimbursement claims. Our model allows us to pass these savings on to our patients. According to\nChiropractic Economics, in 2022, the average fee for a chiropractic treatment involving spinal manipulation in a cash-based practice in the United States is approximately $65. By\ncomparison, our average fee as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $36, approximately 45% lower than the industry average price.\nWe believe our pricing and service offering structure helps us to generate higher usage. The following table sets forth our average price per adjustment as of December 31, 2023 for\npatients who pay by single adjustment plans, multiple adjustment packages and multiple adjustment membership plans. Our price per adjustment as of December 31, 2023 averaged\napproximately $36 across all three groups.\nThe Joint Service Offering\nSingle Visit Package(s) Membership(s)\nPrice per adjustment $45 $19—$35 $17—$22\nProven track record of opening clinics and growing revenue at the clinic level. We have grown our clinic revenue base consistently. From January 2012 through December 31, 2023,\nwe have increased the annual system-wide sales from $22.3 million to $488.0 million (which includes $70.7 million of gross sales from clinics owned or managed by us and $417.3\nmillion from clinics owned or managed by our franchisees, which is a non-GAAP measure for the year ended December 31, 2023). During this period, we increased the number of\nclinics in operation from 33 to 935.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the ability of individual clinics to generate growth. While there is significant variation in results in our system, and the results of our top-performing\nclinics are not representative of our system overall, we believe it is worth noting that in January 2012, the highest-performing clinic in our system was a franchised clinic which had\nmonthly sales of approximately $45,000, and in December 2023, the highest performing clinic in our system was a franchised clinic which had monthly sales of approximately\n$180,000.\nMarket leading position with significant nationwide scale. We are the largest chiropractic franchisor in the United States with over 935 clinics operating across the United States. Our\nchiropractic brand is approximately six times larger than the next largest chiropractic\n5\nTable of Contents\nchain, as of December 31, 2023. As the leader in this vertical, and as one of few players of scale, we believe that we occupy an advantageous position in an otherwise highly\nfragmented market. In conjunction with our scale, we have been able to achieve broad geographic diversification across the United States with clinics in 41 states and the District of\nColumbia as of December 31, 2023. Our geographic reach represents a competitive advantage, as we have demonstrated success across various markets, and we are able to remain\ncompetitive nationally when extraordinary events heavily impact specific markets.\nStrong and proven management team. Our strategic vision is directed by our president and chief executive officer, Peter D. Holt, who has more than 35 years of experience in\ndomestic and international franchising, franchise development and operations. Mr. Holt previously served as president and chief executive officer of Tasti-D-Lite. He also served as\nchief operating officer of 24seven Vending (U.S), where he directed its franchise system in the United States, as executive vice president of development for Mail Boxes Etc. and as\nvice president of international for I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt and Java Coast Fine Coffees. Mr. Holt's executive leadership team includes:\nJake Singleton has served as chief financial officer since November 2018. Mr. Singleton served as our corporate controller before assuming the role of CFO, Mr. Singleton has\nfinancial and accounting experience from his time with the public accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP (EY). During his 10 years in EY's Assurance & Audit practice, he focused on\nservice public companies and assisting in raising capital through debit and equity offerings. Mr. Singleton also gained international experience in EY's Capital Markets transactional\naccounting group during a two-year rotation in the United Kingdom, where he focused on U.S. GAAP & SEC reporting compliance for foreign entities raising capital in the United\nStates.\nLori Abou Habib joined as chief marketing officer in August 2023. Prior to The Joint, Abou Habib served for six years as senior vice president and chief marketing officer of\nSONIC® America's Drive-In®, part of the Inspire Brands family of restaurants. In her role, she led all marketing strategy for SONIC, which included national marketing, media,\ndigital strategy, marketing technology and product innovation. A 15-year veteran of SONIC, Abou Habib earned several promotions with increasing responsibility. Previous to\nSONIC, she worked at CKE Restaurants, Inc. and Eateries, Inc.\nCharles Nelles joined as chief technology officer in January 2022, bringing more than 20 years of technology experience in the healthcare and financial services industries. Prior to\nworking at our company, Mr. Nelles held the role of vice president of technology for American Express Global Business Travel. Prior to that, he served as vice president of technical\noperations support and cloud enablement for Western Union.\nEric Simon joined as senior vice president of franchise sales and development in 2016 with over 20 years of experience in all aspects of franchising, including as director of franchise\ndevelopment for AAMCO Transmissions. Mr. Simon spent five years as a franchisee and area developer with Extreme Pita and previously spent 10 years with Mail Boxes Etc. in\nfranchise sales roles.\nJorge Armenteros joined as senior vice president of operations in 2017 bringing with him more than 40 years of franchise operations and leadership experience. For 10 years prior to\njoining the team, Mr. Armenteros was the executive senior vice president of franchise operations and corporate development for Campero USA, a fast-food restaurant chain. Prior to\nthat, he was founder and chief executive officer of Tri-Brands Management Group, which operated franchised Dunkin’ Donuts, Baskin Robbins and Togo restaurants, and was vice\npresident of operations at Dunkin’ Brands. His career also includes a period as a multi-unit franchisee of Dunkin’ Donuts.\nSteven Knauf, D.C. was promoted to Vice President of Chiropractic and Compliance in 2022. Dr. Knauf began working at The Joint in 2011. After spending four years as a\nchiropractor in one of our clinics, he took the role of Senior Doctor of Chiropractic for 13 of our clinics and, subsequently, was elevated to a director position at the corporate office.\nIn August 2017, he was appointed by the governor to serve on the Arizona Board of Chiropractic Examiners, a position which he continues to hold.\nWe believe that our management team’s experience and demonstrated success in building and operating a robust franchise system is a key driver of our growth and has positioned us\nwell for achieving our long-term strategy.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur goal is not only to capture a significant share of the existing market but also to expand the market for chiropractic care. We are accomplishing this through the rapid geographic\nexpansion of our affordable franchising program and the continued support of our robust regional developer network. Accordingly, our long-term growth tactics include:\n• the continued growth of system sales through the increased attraction and retention of patients;\n6\nTable of Contents\n• the increase in royalty income through the acceleration of the opening of clinics already in development and the sale of additional franchises; and\n• improving operational margins and expanding additional revenue streams within our clinics.\nContinued Growth of System Sales\nSystem wide comparable same-store sales growth (“Comp Sales”) for 2023 was 4%, reflecting the continued resilience of The Joint business model. Comp Sales refers to the amount\nof sales a clinic generates in the most recent accounting period, compared to the amount of sales it generated in a similar period in the past. Comp Sales include the sales from both\ncompany-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. We believe that the\nexperience we have gained in developing and refining management systems, operating standards, training materials and marketing and customer acquisition activities has contributed\nto our system’s revenue growth. In addition, we believe that increasing awareness of our brand has contributed to revenue growth, particularly in markets where the number and\ndensity of our clinics has made cooperative and mass media advertising attractive. We believe that our ability to leverage aggregated and general media digital advertising and search\ntools will continue to grow as the number and density of our clinics increases.\nTo elevate our brand equity and drive awareness, we will strive to increase our active patient count by improving the intake process, by testing setting up appointments for the initial\nvisits only, and by optimizing local clinic marketing. We plan to lengthen the time patients stay engaged with The Joint and to reactivate lapsed patients by leveraging new content,\nautomated messaging, and enticing promotions. Additionally, we intend to employ new media campaigns to increase our new patient leads.\nSelling Additional Franchises\nWe will continue to sell franchises. We believe that to secure leadership in our industry and to maximize our opportunities in our markets, it is important to gain brand equity and\nconsumer awareness as rapidly as possible, consistent with a disciplined approach to opening clinics. We believe that continued sales of franchises in selected markets is the most\neffective way to drive brand awareness in the short term.\nWe believe that we were able to achieve our current scale faster by using a regional developer model, which is employed by many successful franchisors. We sell a regional developer\nthe rights to open a minimum number of clinics in a defined territory. They in turn help us to identify and qualify potential new franchisees in that territory and assist us in providing\nfield training, clinic openings and ongoing support. In return, we share part of the initial franchise fee and pay the regional developer 3% of the 7% ongoing royalties we collect from\nthe franchisees in their protected territory.\nOpening Clinics in Development\nIn addition to our 935 operating clinics as of December 31, 2023, we have granted franchises, either directly or with our regional developers' support, for an additional 132 clinics\nthat we believe will be developed in the future and executed letters-of-intent for 40 future clinic licenses. We will continue to support our franchisees and regional developers to open\nthese clinics and to achieve sustainable performance as rapidly as possible.\nContinuing to Improve Margins\nAs we continue to grow, we expect to drive greater efficiencies across our operations, development and marketing programs and further leverage our technology and existing support\ninfrastructure. We believe we will be able to control corporate costs over time to enhance margins as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our clinic base\nand sales. At the clinic level, we expect to drive margins and labor efficiencies through continued sales growth and consistently applied operating standards as our clinic base matures\nand the average number of patient visits increases. In addition, we continue to consider introducing selected and complementary branded products such as nutraceuticals or dietary\nsupplements and related additional services.\nRegulatory Environment\nHIPAA and State Privacy and Breach Notification Rules\nNumerous federal and state laws, regulations, standards and other legal obligations govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, security and processing of\npersonal information, including cybersecurity breach notification and targeted advertising. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)\nimposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the healthcare\n7\nTable of Contents\nindustry. While we have determined that we are not a “covered entity” and thus do not currently fall under the purview of HPAA, we may have access to sensitive data regarding our\npatients, and we recognize that some of the standards established by HIPAA represent “best practices” for our business. Even when entities are not covered by HIPAA, the Federal\nTrade Commission (the \"FTC\") has taken the position that a failure to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in\nor affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the\nsensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities\nhandling certain personal information. The CCPA regime became more complex as of January 1, 2023, pursuant to amendments adopted pursuant to the California Privacy Rights\nAct (the “CPRA”). The CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new\naudit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The CPRA also creates a new California data protection agency to implement and enforce the\nCCPA and the CPRA, which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new privacy legislation. A\nnew Virginia privacy law, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), and a new Colorado law, the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), impose many similar obligations\nregarding the processing and storing of personal information as the CCPA and the CPRA. Other states have enacted or are considering enacting privacy laws. All 50 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia have adopted some form of breach notification laws, requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches of personal information.\nWe expect that the regulatory focus on privacy, security and data use issues will continue to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information will\nexpand and become more complex. Such new privacy laws add additional requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk and require additional investment in resources for\ncompliance programs.\nWe believe that our operations comply with legally required standards for privacy and security of personal information to the extent applicable under federal or state law, and we\nstrive to comply with additional standards that we identify as “best practices.” Such ongoing compliance involves significant time, effort and expense.\nDespite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be\nvulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. For\nexample, in November 2022, one of our marketing vendors notified us that it had suffered a data breach that resulted in the release of certain information (names, email addresses,\nphysical addresses consisting of city state, and zip codes, phone numbers and birthdates) of many of our patients and employees. The vendor further notified us that the information\nthat had been released did not include credit card or bank account numbers, social security numbers or similar sensitive personal information. In addition, our vendor reported that\nthey had quickly identified the source of the breach and rectified the situation, preventing the disclosure of additional information. We believe that a very limited number of affected\nindividuals (all of whom had thejoint.com domain email address, with the exception of one) received ransom demands. Upon learning the details of the breach, we immediately\nembarked on an investigation and retained outside legal counsel to provide guidance with respect to any applicable legal obligations. Based on our investigation and the legal\nguidance we received, it was determined that the breach did not result in the release of “personal information,” as defined in the relevant data breach notification laws of all but two\nstates. With respect to those two states, on or about May 1, 2023, counsel for The Joint Corp. delivered notices to the respective state Offices of the Attorneys General in compliance\nwith state disclosure regulations. As of the current date, neither state has issued a response. Upon receipt of the root cause analysis from the vendors, we followed up with its\nleadership team to ensure that the specific breach had been remediated and to confirm that related processes and practices for future data protection had been updated. Based upon our\ninvestigation, we believe that the data breach did not have a material adverse effect on our business or result in any material damage to us. Furthermore, we are entitled to\nindemnification under the contract with the vendor for costs we incurred in addressing the data breach, including any costs with respect to breach notification.\nState Regulations on Corporate Practice of Chiropractic\nIn states that regulate the “corporate practice of chiropractic,” chiropractic services are provided solely by legal entities organized under state laws as professional corporations\n(\"PCs\") or their equivalents. Each of the PCs in our system is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors and employs or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices.\nWe do not own any capital stock of (or have any other ownership interest in) any such PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management\nservices agreements with PCs to provide the PCs on an exclusive basis with all non-clinical administrative services needed by the chiropractic practice.\nIn February 2020, the State of Washington Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission delivered notices that it was investigating complaints made against three chiropractors who\nown clinics, or are (or were) employed by clinics, in Washington. These clinics\n8\nTable of Contents\nreceive management services from our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors. The notices contained allegations of fee-splitting, specifically targeting a provision in our\nFranchise Disclosure Document (\"FDD\") providing for the payment of royalty fees based on revenue derived from the furnishing of chiropractic care. The notices appeared to\nquestion our business model. The Commission posed a number of questions to the chiropractors and requested documentation describing the fee structure and related matters. All\nthree chiropractors responded to the Commission, and the Commission has since closed the investigations with respect to two of the chiropractors, finding that the evidence did not\nsupport any claim of violation. It appears that the investigation with respect to the third chiropractor has either been closed or gone dormant.\nIn February 2019, a bill was introduced in the Arkansas state legislature prohibiting the ownership and management of a chiropractic corporation by a non-chiropractor. The bill was\ndrafted by the Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners. This bill has since been withdrawn. While it is questionable whether the prohibition would have been applicable to\nour business model in Arkansas, the bill could have been interpreted to challenge that model if it had passed in its proposed form. We have no assurance that another bill posing a\nsimilar or greater challenge to our business model will not be introduced in the future. Previously, in 2015, the Arkansas Board had questioned whether our business model might\nviolate Arkansas law in its response to an inquiry we made on behalf of one of our franchisees. While the Arkansas Board did not thereafter pursue the matter of a possible violation,\nit might choose to do so at any time in the future.\nIn February 2019, the North Carolina Board of Chiropractic Examiners delivered notices alleging certain violations to sixteen chiropractors working for clinics in North Carolina for\nwhich our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors provide management services. We retained legal counsel in this matter, and a preliminary hearing was conducted on\nFebruary 21, 2019. The North Carolina Board issued its findings to each of the individual chiropractors, which generally included an overall finding that probable cause existed to\nshow that the chiropractors violated one or more of the North Carolina Board’s rules. The findings each also proposed an Informal Settlement Agreement in lieu of proceeding to a\nfull hearing before the North Carolina Board. On April 22, 2019, each of the chiropractors, through their attorneys, delivered to the North Carolina Board notices refuting the North\nCarolina Board’s findings and seeking revisions to the Settlement Agreement. The North Carolina Board replied with certain counterproposals, and all chiropractors have since\naccepted the terms. While the allegations consisted primarily of quality of care and advertising issues, it is possible that the actions of the North Carolina Board arose out of concerns\nrelated to our business model, and if so, we have no assurance that the North Carolina Board will not pursue other claims against the chiropractors in the future.\nIn November 2018, the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners adopted changes to its rules to prohibit a chiropractor from owning or operating a chiropractic practice as a\nsurrogate for a non-chiropractor. As in the case of the proposed Arkansas bill, it is questionable whether this prohibition is applicable to our business model in Oregon; however,\ndepending upon how the amended rules are interpreted, they could similarly pose a threat. Since our franchisees began operating in Oregon, the Oregon Board has made several\ninquiries with respect to our business model. We have typically satisfied these inquiries by providing a brief response or documentation. In February 2018, the Oregon Board asked\nus for clarification regarding ownership of our franchise locations operating in Oregon, and we responded with the requested clarification. The Oregon Board has not taken any\nfurther action, but we have no assurance that it will not do so in the future or that we have satisfied the Oregon Board’s concerns. One of our franchisees received a letter from the\nOregon Board alleging a violation of the rules against the corporate practice of chiropractic, but after a further exchange of correspondence with the franchisee, the Oregon Board\nnotified the franchisee in August 2018 that the case was closed.\nIn November 2015, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners commenced an administrative proceeding to which we were not a party, in which it claimed that the doctor who\nowns the PC that we manage in southern California violated California’s prohibition on the corporate practice of chiropractic, among other claims, because our management of the\nclinics operated by his PC involved the exercise of control over certain clinical aspects of his practice. The claims were subsequently dismissed congruent with the decision of the\nadministrative law judge who conducted the proceeding; however, we cannot assure you that similar claims will not be made in the future, either against us or our affiliated PCs.\nIn a June 2015 Assurance of Discontinuance with the New York Attorney General, Aspen Dental Management, a provider of business support services to independently owned dental\npractices, agreed to settle claims that it improperly made business decisions impacting clinical matters, illegally engaged in fee-splitting with dental practices and required the dental\npractices to use the “Aspen Dental” trade name in a manner that had the potential to mislead consumers into believing that the “Aspen Dental”- branded offices were under common\nownership with the provider. Pursuant to the settlement, Aspen Dental paid a substantial fine and agreed to change its business and branding practices, including changes to its\nwebsite and marketing materials in order to make clear that the Aspen-branded dental offices were independently owned and operated. While it has not done so to date, we cannot\nassure you that the New York Attorney General will not similarly choose to challenge our contractual relationships with our affiliated PCs in New York and, in particular, to question\nwhether use of The Joint trademark by our affiliated PCs misleads consumers, causing them to incorrectly conclude that we are the provider of chiropractic treatment.\n9\nTable of Contents\nThe Kansas Healing Arts Board, in response to a third-party complaint about one of our franchisees, sent a letter to the franchisee in February 2015 questioning whether the franchise\nbusiness model might violate Kansas law regarding the unauthorized practice of chiropractic care. At the time, we and the franchisee had several communications with the Kansas\nBoard with respect to modifying the management agreement to address its concerns. While we have had no further communications with the Board since that time, we have also\nreceived no assurance that changes to the agreement satisfied all of its concerns, and thus we cannot assure you that similar claims will not be made in the future, either against us or\nour affiliated PCs.\nWhile the effect of the Arkansas bill if passed, the Oregon rules changes, and the proceedings in Washington, North Carolina, California, New York and Kansas may be that our\nbusiness practices in those states are under stricter scrutiny than elsewhere, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws relating to the corporate practice of\nchiropractic.\nPlease see the risk factor in Item 1A for additional discussion of the “Risks Related to State Regulations on the Corporate Practice of Chiropractic” as they relate to our business\nmodel.\nRegulation Relating to Franchising\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of the FTC and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state laws require that we furnish an\nFDD containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the FDD at least annually with state authorities. Included in the\ninformation required to be disclosed in our FDD is our business experience, material litigation, all fees due to us from franchisees, a franchisee’s estimated initial investment,\nrestrictions on sources of products and services we impose on franchisees, development and operating obligations of franchisees, whether we provide financing to franchisees, our\ntraining and support obligations and other terms and conditions of our franchise agreement. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our\nqualifications for exemption as set forth in those states’ laws. As of December 31, 2023, we were registered to sell franchises in every state (where registrations are required) and\ncould sell franchises in all 50 states.\nSubstantive state laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in many states. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-\ncompetition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. A policy from the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.\n(“NASAA”) rejects the use of required representations or waivers of claims by franchisees in franchise agreements for the purpose of insulating a franchisor from liability in disputes\nrelated to alleged fraud or misrepresentations during the offer and sale of a franchise. Although NASAA has no legal authority to prohibit such provisions, it is likely that state\nregulators will follow NASAA’s guidance and limit their use, as California has already done. Franchisors risk exposure to unfair trade practice claims by state regulators if they try to\nuse a franchisee’s representations in a manner that offends NASAA’s policy. The use of such offending representations also could increase the likelihood of successful lawsuits\nagainst franchisors by franchisees over claims of fraud or misrepresentation. Bills also have been introduced in Congress from time to time providing for protection of franchisee\nrights, including certain currently pending bills seeking to establish what are described as fair franchise practices. Compliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our\nexpenses to increase, and non-compliance with such laws could result in penalties or enforcement actions against us. However, we believe that our FDD and franchising procedures\ncurrently comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises. As\nthose guidelines and laws change, we will revise our FDD and franchising procedures accordingly.\nOther Federal, State and Local Regulation\nWe are subject to varied federal regulations affecting the operation of our business. We are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act (the \"FLSA\"), the U.S. Immigration Reform\nand Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe\nbenefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our clinic service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable\nminimum wage, and increases in the minimum wage are likely to increase our labor costs. As of January 1, 2023, the minimum wage increased in a number of states, the District of\nColumbia and local municipalities, with many of these wage increases triggered automatically by increases in the cost of living due to high inflation. Many of our smaller franchisees\nqualify for exemption from the requirement to either provide health insurance benefits or pay a penalty to the IRS if not provided because of their small number of employees. The\nimposition of any requirement that we or our franchisees provide health insurance benefits to our or their employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits that we\ncurrently provide to our employees or that franchisees may or may not provide, or the imposition of additional employer paid employment taxes on income earned by our employees,\ncould have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards,\nwhich could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nJoint Employer Rules\n10\nTable of Contents\nBackground. As a franchisor, we could be liable for certain employment law and other labor-related claims against our franchisees if we are found to be a joint employer of our\nfranchisees’ employees. A July 2014 decision by the United States National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\") held that McDonald’s Corporation could be held liable as a “joint\nemployer” for labor and wage violations by its franchisees under the FLSA. After this decision, the NLRB issued a number of complaints against McDonald’s Corporation in\nconnection with these violations, although these complaints were ultimately settled without any admission of liability by McDonald’s. Additionally, an August 2015 decision by the\nNLRB held that Browning-Ferris Industries was a “joint employer” for purposes of collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act (the \"NLRA\") and, thus, obligated to\nnegotiate with the Teamsters union over workers supplied by a contract staffing firm within one of its recycling plants.\nIn an effort to effectively reverse the McDonald’s Corporation decision, in 2020, the Department of Labor (the \"DOL\") issued a final rule narrowing the meaning of “joint employer”\nin the FLSA. Much of the new rule relating to “joint employer” status was then vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in a lawsuit brought\nby various state attorneys general. Similarly, in an effort to effectively reverse the Browning-Ferris decision, in 2020, the NLRB issued a final rule, narrowing the meaning of “joint\nemployer” in the collective bargaining context under the NLRA.\nCurrent Status of Joint Employer Rules. On October 27, 2023, the NLRB published a final rule redefining joint employment standards under the NLRA. This rule, which took\neffect on February 26, 2024, resurrects the broader standards from the NLRB’s 2015 Browning-Ferris Industries decision, which include considerations of indirect or potential\ncontrol in determining joint employment. If two entities are deemed joint employers, both could be jointly liable for unfair labor practices and may be required to participate in\ncollective bargaining, sharing legal responsibilities for the affected employees.\nThe rule's proposal has sparked legal challenges from different directions. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has filed a lawsuit challenging the NLRB’s joint\nemployer rule, arguing that it is not expansive enough. In contrast, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with other trade groups, has initiated legal action, contending that the rule\ncontradicts the NLRA and is arbitrary and capricious, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The time frame for the resolution of these lawsuits is dependent on the\ncourts and we are not able to comment further.\nEffective on September 28, 2021, the DOL withdrew the joint employer final rules under the FLSA, which had narrowed the definition of “joint employer” under the FLSA. Key\nprovisions of the joint employer final rules had already been vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in a lawsuit brought by various state\nattorneys general. The DOL has not proposed to replace the withdrawn rule with any new guidance, reverting to a legal landscape which includes a more expansive definition of\n“joint employer.” Under a more expansive definition, a franchisor could be held jointly liable with its franchisee for minimum wages and overtime pay violations by the franchisee,\ndepending on the extent of control and supervision the franchisor is able to exercise over the franchisee’s employees.\nIn addition to efforts to expand the definition of “joint employer” through the final rule under the NLRA and the withdrawal of the FLSA rule, it is expected that the Equal\nOpportunity Employment Commission (the \"EEOC\"), which enforces anti-discrimination laws, will issue rules which include an expansive definition of “joint employer.”\nSignificance of Joint Employer Rules for our Business Model. The replacement or withdrawal of the NLRA and FLSA rules and possible new rules for the EEOC, which include\nor reinstate expansive definitions of “joint employer,” have implications for our business model. We could have responsibility for damages, reinstatement, back pay and penalties in\nconnection with labor law and employment discrimination violations by our franchisees over whom we have limited control. Furthermore, it may be easier for our franchisees’\nemployees to organize into unions, require us to participate in collective bargaining with those employees, provide those employees and their union representatives with bargaining\npower to request that we have our franchisees raise wages, and make it more expensive and less profitable to operate a franchised clinic.\nCalifornia AB-5. California adopted Assembly Bill 5 (\"AB-5\"), which took effect on January 1, 2020. This legislation codifies the standard established in a California Supreme\nCourt case (Dynamex Operations West v. Superior Court) for determining whether workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors, with a strict test that puts\nthe burden of proof on employers to establish that workers are not employees. The law is aimed at the so-called “gig economy” where workers in many industries are treated as\nindependent contractors, rather than employees, and lack the protections of wage and hour laws, although California voters approved a ballot initiative, now under court review, to\nexclude app-based drivers from the application of AB-5. AB-5 is not a franchise-specific law and does not address joint employer liability; however, a significant concern exists in\nthe franchise industry that an expansive interpretation of AB-5 could be used to hold franchisors jointly liable for the labor law violations of its franchisees. Courts addressing this\nissue have come to differing conclusions, and while it remains uncertain as to how the joint employer issue will finally be resolved in California, potential new federal laws or\nregulations may ultimately be controlling on this issue.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAB-5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion. Other states are considering similar approaches. Some states have adopted similar laws in narrower contexts, and a\nhandful of other states have adopted similar laws for broader purposes. All of these laws or proposed laws may similarly raise concerns with respect to the expansion of joint liability\nto the franchise industry. Furthermore, there have been private lawsuits in which parties have alleged that a franchisor and its franchisee “jointly employ” the franchisee’s staff, that\nthe franchisor is responsible for the franchisees’ staff (under theories of apparent agency, ostensible agency, or actual agency), or otherwise.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\nWe are required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related federal and state statutes, which generally\nprohibit discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may, in the future, have to modify our clinics to provide service to or make reasonable\naccommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.\nCompetition\nThe chiropractic industry is highly fragmented. According to the November 2023 IBIS market research report, the Top 50 industry practices accounted for only 4% of total industry\nrevenue. Our competitors include approximately 40,000 independent chiropractic offices currently open throughout the United States, according to a 2024 Kentley Insights market\nresearch report, as well as certain multi-unit operators. We may also face competition from traditional medical practices, outpatient clinics, physical therapists, med-spas, massage\ntherapists and sellers of devices intended for home use to address back and joint discomfort. Our three largest multi-unit competitors are Airrosti, HealthSource Chiropractic and\n100% Chiropractic, all of which are insurance-based models.\nWe have identified eight competitors who are attempting to duplicate our cash-only, low cost, appointment-free model. Based on publicly available information, five of these\ncompetitors each operate fewer than 15 clinics as franchises, and the largest competitor operated 131 clinics as franchises as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate that other direct\ncompetitors will join our industry as our visibility, reputation and perceived advantages become more widely known. We believe our first mover advantage, proprietary operations\nsystems and strong unit level economics will continue to accelerate our growth even with the spawning of additional competition.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe that a strong culture of engagement and alignment to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. Therefore, it is important to attract, develop and retain a diverse\nand engaged workforce at all levels of our business. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we are committed to fostering a workplace where our employees feel aligned with\nour mission, proud of our culture and engaged in their work, with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation and benefits.\nWorkforce\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our consolidated VIEs employed approximately 444 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 350 persons on a part-time basis. None of our\nemployees are members of unions or participate in other collective bargaining arrangements.\nRecruitment\nWe believe our employees are among our most valuable resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and\nexperienced individuals to operate our clinics and support our operations, and our management believes in a continuous improvement culture and routinely reviews employee\nturnover rates at various levels of the organization.\nIn order to continue our growth through clinic development and, in light of the recent shortage of qualified chiropractors, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain qualified\nchiropractors. We strive to make The Joint Chiropractic the career path of choice for chiropractors, with opportunities for our chiropractors to grow and develop in their careers,\nsupported by competitive compensation and benefits, and with our simple business model that allows our chiropractors to focus on patient care. Our competitive employment\nprogram for chiropractors includes (i) full time and flexible hours, with full benefits and paid time off, (ii) part time and flexible hours with some benefits, (iii) company-paid\nmalpractice insurance, (iv) tuition reimbursement, sign-on and referral bonuses in certain circumstances, and (v) a competitive starting base salary. We have also bolstered our\nrecruitment function, and we continue to fine-tune and re-strategize our search for chiropractors. In addition, we continue to expand and strengthen our relationship with chiropractic\ncolleges to increase engagement with students and to increase the applicant flow of qualified candidates.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we will continue to utilize engagement surveys to understand the perception of our brand as an employer and the\neffectiveness of our employee and compensation programs and to learn where we can improve across the company.\nTalent Management and Development\nOur employees’ personal and professional growth is critical for the success of our business. Our approach to performance and development is designed to motivate our employees to\ndevelop, leverage their strengths, and support a coaching and feedback culture. We offer numerous online courses and encourage our employees to attend conferences, training\ncourses, and continuing education classes. Additionally, we conduct periodic assessments to identify talent needs and growth paths for our employees.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Equity\nWe are committed to providing market competitive compensation and benefits. To ensure we remain competitive, we conduct periodic benchmarking to analyze our compensation\ndata and take steps to ensure gender and other demographic equality is addressed. Our compensation practices are intended to be merit-based, focused on roles, responsibilities,\nexperience and performance, with no consideration given to gender, age, ethnicity or other similar factors. We use a combination of fixed and incentive pay, including base salary,\nbonuses, and stock-based compensation. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected leaders through the granting of stock-based\ncompensation awards. Our benefit offerings include comprehensive medical coverage, paid time off, a retirement savings plan, free family wellness membership at our clinics and\nflexible work schedules.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe recognize that our best performance comes when our teams are diverse, and accordingly, diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\") are a critical part of our vision of building a\nworld-class organizational culture. We reemphasized our focus on DEI when we designated DEI as part of the formal responsibilities of our senior leaders and a key strategic\ninitiative integral to continued development of franchised clinics and our brand. We are also committed to maximizing the performance and potential of our corporate employees. In\n2021, we formalized and implemented our performance and compensation management resources, which include (i) establishing a formal compensation structure and guidelines and\n(ii) increasing employee and manager training.\nCode of Conduct & Ethics\nIn 2024, we updated our Code of Conduct to reinforce our commitment to adhering to moral and ethical principles. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of acting with integrity\nas outlined in our core values statements.\nFacilities\nWe lease the property for our corporate headquarters and all of the properties on which we own or manage clinics. As of December 31, 2023, we leased 138 facilities in which we\noperate or intend to operate clinics. We are obligated under two additional leases for facilities in which we have ceased clinic operations.\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 16767 N. Perimeter Center Drive, Suite 110, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260. The term of our lease for this location expires on December 31,\n2025. The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are finance and accounting, treasury, marketing, operations, human resources, information systems support, and\nlegal.\nWe are also obligated under non-cancellable leases for the clinics which we own or manage. Our clinics are on average 1,200 square feet. Our clinic leases generally have an initial\nterm of five years, include one to two options to renew for terms of five years, and require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance\ncharges and other operating costs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 935 franchised or company-owned or managed clinics in operation in 41 states and the District of Columbia. All of our locations are leased.\nIntellectual Property\nTrademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks\nOur registered trademarks include the following in the United States:\n13\nTable of Contents\nTrademark Registration Date Registration Number\nDON'T DO PAIN.

RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESS\nThe nationwide labor shortage has negatively impacted our ability to recruit chiropractors and other qualified personnel, and the measures we have taken in response\nhave reduced our net revenues.\nThe current nationwide labor shortage and, in particular the shortage of qualified chiropractors, has negatively impacted our ability and the ability of our franchisees to recruit and\nretain qualified chiropractors, wellness coordinators and other qualified personnel. This shortage has limited our ability to open new clinics and has required us to enhance wages and\nbenefits and shorten clinic operating hours. All of these measures have reduced our net revenues and increased our operating expenses and may continue to do so if labor shortages\ncontinue.\nInflation has led to increased labor costs and interest rates and may lead to reduced discretionary spending, all of which may negatively impact our business.\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and through 2023, company-owned or managed clinics were negatively\nimpacted by wage increases, which increased our general and administrative expenses and decreased profitability. A significant number of our clinic service personnel are paid at\nrates related to the applicable minimum wage, and increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. As of January 1, 2023, the minimum wage increased in a number\nof states, the District of Columbia and local municipalities, with many of these wage increases triggered automatically by increases in the cost of living due to high inflation. Such\nwage increases likely will further increase our general and administrative expenses in the affected jurisdictions. A continued increase in labor costs is likely to continue to have an\nadverse impact on profitability and may result in additional price increases to offset their impact. Further, should we fail to continue to increase our wages competitively in response\nto any continued increase in wage rates, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our patient services to suffer.\nIn addition to relief and recovery, our services emphasize preventive and maintenance care, which is generally not a medical necessity, and may be viewed as a discretionary medical\nexpenditure. Discretionary spending is negatively impacted by, among other things, those factors disclosed in this Form 10-K under the caption “Recent Events” in Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- unfavorable global economic or political conditions, such as the Ukraine War, the Israel-Gaza conflict,\nlabor shortages, inflation and other cost increases, and increases in interest rates. As further disclosed under the aforementioned caption, we anticipate that fiscal 2024 will continue to\nbe a volatile macroeconomic environment and expect elevated levels of cost inflation to persist for 2024. Reductions in discretionary spending may adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. Rising interest rates also will make it more expensive for potential franchisees to finance new clinic acquisitions and thus may reduce the\npool of available franchisees, which also could adversely impact our business.\nIn the event that a continued deterioration of economic conditions causes a significant decrease in demand for our services, this could negatively impact our ability to meet the\nfinancial covenants in our credit facility, although we were in compliance as of December 31, 2023. Furthermore, a deterioration of equity and credit markets may make other debt or\nequity financing difficult to obtain in a timely manner and on favorable terms, if at all, and if obtained, may be more costly or more dilutive. If we are unable to access our credit\nfacility as a result of noncompliance with its covenants or are unable to obtain other debt or equity financing, this could limit our opportunity to acquire more clinics and regional\ndeveloper rights and to pursue other corporate initiatives.\nNew clinics, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales that we have experienced in the past may not be\nindicative of future results.\nOur clinics continue to demonstrate increases in comparable clinic sales even as they mature. Our annual Comp Sales for the full year 2023, for clinics that have been open for at\nleast 13 full months, was 4%, and for clinics that have been open for greater than 48 months, was (1)%. However, we cannot assure you that this will continue for our existing clinics\nor that clinics we open in the future will see similar results. In new markets, the length of time before average sales for new clinics stabilize is less predictable and can be longer than\nwe expect because of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers’ limited awareness of our brand. New clinics may not be profitable, and their sales performance may not\nfollow historical patterns. In addition, our average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales for existing clinics may not increase at the rates achieved over the past several years. Our\nability to operate new clinics, especially company-owned or managed clinics, profitably and increase average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales depends on many factors, some\nof which are beyond our control, including: (i) consumer awareness and understanding of our brand and changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending; (ii)\n15\nTable of Contents\ngeneral economic conditions, which can affect clinic traffic, local rent and labor costs and prices we pay for the supplies we use; (iii) competition, either from our competitors in the\nchiropractic industry or our own and our franchisees’ clinics; (iv) the identification and availability of attractive sites for new facilities and the anticipated commercial, residential and\ninfrastructure development near our new facilities; (v) changes in government regulation; (vi) in certain regions, decreases in demand for our services due to inclement weather; and\n(vii) other unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nIf our new clinics do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve our expected average clinics sales, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes a significant number of new franchised clinics. Our existing clinic management systems, administrative staff, financial and management controls and\ninformation systems may be inadequate to support our continued expansion. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our\nexisting clinics. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain managers and team\nmembers. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, clinic teams and existing infrastructure which could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We replaced and upgraded our IT platform in 2021, but we cannot provide assurances that our on-going\nimprovements and enhancements efforts will be executed without delays, difficulties or service interruptions.\nOur expansion into new markets may be more costly and difficult than we currently anticipate which would result in slower growth than we expect.\nClinics we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, marketing or operating\ncosts than clinics we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending\npatterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional\nactivity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who share our vision and culture. We\nmay also incur higher costs from entering new markets, particularly with company-owned or managed clinics if, for example, we hire and assign regional managers to manage\ncomparatively fewer clinics than in more developed markets. For these reasons, some of our new clinics were less successful than our existing clinics or have achieved target rates of\npatient visits at a slower rate. If we do not successfully execute our plans to enter new markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected\nOpening new clinics in existing markets may negatively affect revenue at our existing clinics.\nThe target area of our clinics varies by location and depends on a number of factors, including population density, other available retail services, area demographics and geography.\nAs a result, the opening of a new clinic in or near markets in which we already have clinics could adversely affect the revenues of those existing clinics. Existing clinics could also\nmake it more difficult to build our patient base for a new clinic in the same market. Our business strategy does not entail opening new clinics that we believe will materially affect\nrevenue at our existing clinics, but we may selectively open new clinics in and around areas of existing clinics that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our patients.\nRevenue “cannibalization” between our clinics may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our revenue growth, which could, in\nturn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation or our brand in existing or new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built our reputation on high quality, empathetic patient care, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to continue to be successful in the future. Our\nbrand may be diminished if we do not continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for facility operations,\nequipment upgrades and staff training. Any incident, real or perceived, regardless of merit or outcome, that erodes our brand, such as failure to comply with federal, state or local\nregulations including allegations or perceptions of non-compliance or failure to comply with ethical and operating standards, could significantly reduce the value of our brand, expose\nus to adverse publicity and damage our overall business and reputation. Further, our brand value could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if patients perceive a\nreduction in the quality of service or staff.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur marketing programs may not be successful.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain patients. Our marketing activities are principally focused on increasing brand awareness and\ndriving patient volumes. As we open new clinics, we undertake aggressive marketing campaigns to increase community awareness about our growing presence. We plan to continue\nto utilize targeted marketing efforts within local neighborhoods through channels such as radio, digital media, community sponsorships and events, and a robust online/social media\npresence. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenue. Our ability to market our services may be restricted or limited\nby federal or state law.\nWe will be subject to risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases for clinics that we intend to operate.\nWe do not own, and we do not intend to own, any of the real property where our company-owned or managed clinics operate. We anticipate that our leases generally will have an\ninitial term of five or ten years and generally can be extended only in five-year increments (at increased rates). We expect that all of our leases will require a fixed annual rent,\nalthough some may require the payment of additional rent if clinic sales exceed a negotiated amount. We expect that our leases will typically be net leases, which require us to pay all\nof the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities, and that these leases will not be cancellable by us. If a future company-owned or managed clinic is not profitable, resulting\nin its closure, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease\nterm. In addition, we may fail to negotiate renewals as each of our leases expires, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy\ncosts or to close clinics in desirable locations. These potential increases in occupancy costs and the cost of closing company-owned or managed clinics could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in economic conditions and adverse weather and other unforeseen conditions could materially affect our ability to maintain or increase sales at our clinics or open\nnew clinics.\nOur services emphasize maintenance therapy, which is generally not a medical necessity, and should be viewed as a discretionary medical expenditure. The United States in general\nor the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed economic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high\nlevels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may\naffect consumer discretionary spending. As noted in a previous risk factor, the current period of high inflation, which is expected to persist through at least 2024, is likely to reduce\nconsumer discretionary spending. Traffic in our clinics could decline if consumers choose to reduce the amount they spend on non-critical medical procedures. Negative economic\nconditions might cause consumers to make long-term changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including reducing medical discretionary spending on a permanent basis. In\naddition, given our geographic concentrations in the West, Southwest, Southeast, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, economic conditions in those particular areas of the\ncountry could have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, and regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse\nweather conditions, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. All of our clinics depend on visibility and walk-in traffic, and the effects of adverse weather may decrease visits to malls in which our clinics are\nlocated and negatively impact our revenues. If clinic sales decrease, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of revenues. Reductions in staff\nlevels, asset impairment charges and potential clinic closures could result from prolonged negative clinic sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO USE OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS MODEL\nOur dependence on the success of our franchisees exposes us to risks including the loss of royalty revenue and harm to our brand.\nA substantial portion of our revenues comes from royalties generated by our franchised clinics, which royalties are based on the revenues generated by those clinics. We anticipate\nthat franchise royalties will represent a substantial part of our revenues in the future. As of December 31, 2023, we had franchisees operating or managing 800 clinics. We rely on the\nperformance of our franchisees in successfully opening and operating their clinics and paying royalties and other fees to us on a timely basis. Our franchise system subjects us to a\nnumber of risks as described here and in the next four risk factors. These risks include a significant further decline in our franchisees’ revenue, which occurred in 2020 as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in 2020, we took additional actions to support our franchisees that experienced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, further reducing\nour royalty revenues and other fees from franchisees. In 2020, for a period of time, we waived\n17\nTable of Contents\nminimum royalty requirements, monthly software fees for clinics forced to close temporarily due to the pandemic, and minimum required marketing expenditures. We may need to\nre-implement, expand or extend these accommodations to franchisees, further reducing our revenues from franchised clinics and reducing the visibility of “The Joint” brand in the\nmarketplace. Any new or re-implemented accommodations and the occurrence of any of the other events described here and in the next four risk factors could impact our ability to\ncollect royalty payments from our franchisees, harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur franchisees are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nFranchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. Although we have developed criteria to\nevaluate and screen prospective franchisees, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises\nin their approved locations, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise agreements. Moreover, despite our training, support and monitoring,\nfranchisees may not successfully operate clinics in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and adequately train qualified personnel. The failure of\nour franchisees to operate their franchises successfully and the actions taken by their employees could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand and our ability to\nattract prospective franchisees, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed.\nEach franchise agreement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain\ncircumstances a franchise agreement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise agreements are drafted broadly\nand include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten our intellectual property. In addition, each franchise agreement has an\nexpiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise agreement, we or the franchisee may, or may not, elect to renew the franchise agreement. If the franchise agreement is renewed,\nthe franchisee will receive a new franchise agreement for an additional term. Such option, however, is contingent on the franchisee’s execution of the then- current form of franchise\nagreement (which may include increased royalty payments, advertising fees and other costs) and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of\nthe foregoing conditions, we may elect not to renew the expiring franchise agreement, in which event the franchise agreement will terminate upon expiration of its term. The\ntermination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement could result in the reduction of royalty payments we receive.\nOur franchisees may not meet timetables for opening their clinics, which could reduce the royalties we receive.\nOur franchise agreements specify a timetable for opening the clinic. Failure by our franchisees to open their clinics within the specified time limit would result in the reduction of\nroyalty payments we would have otherwise received and could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we had active licenses and letters-of-\nintent for 172 clinics which we believe to be developable within the specified time periods, but we cannot be certain of this.\nOur regional developers are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nOur regional developers are independent operators. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. We depend upon our regional developers to sell a minimum number of\nfranchises within their territories and to assist the purchasers of those franchises to develop and operate their clinics. The failure by regional developers to sell the specified minimum\nnumber of franchises within the time limits set forth in their regional developer license agreements would reduce the franchise fees we would otherwise receive, delay the payment of\nroyalties to us and result in a potential event of default under the regional developer license agreement. Of our total of 17 regional developers as of December 31, 2023, three had not\nmet their minimum franchise sales requirements within the time periods specified in their regional developer agreements.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nOur level of debt could impair our financial condition and ability to operate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had drawn $2.0 million under the Credit Agreement (defined at Note 7, Debt). Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors,\nincluding:\n• requiring a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other\ncapital needs;\n18\nTable of Contents\n• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow, after paying principal and\ninterest on our debt, may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;\n• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, since we will be required to devote a proportion of our cash flow to paying principal and\ninterest on our debt during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow;\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements; and\n• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, and general corporate requirements.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial\nreporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence.\nWe are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm is now required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\npursuant to Section 404, since as of December 31, 2023, we became an accelerated filer.\nInternal controls related to the operation of financial reporting and accounting systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As discussed in\nPart II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K, our management previously concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to\nmaterial weaknesses in internal controls related to (i) the accounting treatment in significant complex areas, and (ii) the identification of uncertain tax positions. We did not design\nand maintain effective controls over the accounting of complex areas, including accounting for revenue recognition and we did not design and maintain effective controls over the\nidentification of uncertain tax positions.\nDuring 2023, management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included modifying internal controls to address completeness of documentation on uncertain\ntax positions, revenue and acquisition related transactions over adoptions of the appropriate respective accounting standards, specifically through the utilization of subject matter\nexperts to review conclusions over complex accounting policies.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded\nthe material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2023.\nWe previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2021 material weaknesses in internal control that have since been remediated, except those internal\ncontrols related to complex accounting areas. Specifically, these material weaknesses related to: (i) risk assessment and scoping - we did not effectively design and maintain controls\nin response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, the design of existing controls or the implementation of new controls has not been sufficient to respond to the risks of\nmaterial misstatement related to the incremental borrowing rate for our leases, deferred costs and related expenses, other revenues, breakage revenue, intangible asset amortization,\ndetermination of reporting units, reassessment of our VIEs, stock option exercises, and the accuracy and completeness of certain financial statements; (ii) segregation of duties - we\ndid not design and maintain effective controls such that all accounting duties are sufficiently segregated within our business processes and certain financial applications. Specifically,\nwe failed to have the appropriate personnel monitor users with administrative access to certain financial applications and data, and we did not design and maintain effective controls\nsuch that all accounting duties are sufficiently segregated; (iii) accounting related to significant complex accounting areas - we did not design and maintain effective controls over the\naccounting of complex accounting areas, including taxes and business combination and asset acquisition transactions Specifically, we failed to properly design controls to\nappropriately determine the proper accounting treatment for certain revenue streams and leases. During 2022, we completed the remediation measures related to the material\nweakness described in this paragraph. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information\naccurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods\n19\nTable of Contents\ncould be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor\nconfidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nInternal controls related to the operation of financial reporting and accounting systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We cannot provide\nany assurance that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or a reporting unit could result in an impairment\ncharge recorded in our operating results, which could be material.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Also, we\nreview our amortizable intangible assets for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying\namount of our goodwill or another intangible asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment charge recognized as a noncash\nexpense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and\nestimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other\nintangible assets.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant number of long-lived assets in our corporate clinics, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and\nequipment. A decline in the current and projected cash flows in our corporate clinics could result in impairment charges, which could be material.\nLong-lived assets, such as operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and property, plant and equipment in our corporate clinics, are tested for impairment if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be\nwritten down to its fair value and an impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating\nresults compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment\ncharge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets.\nOur increased reliance on sources of revenue other than from company-owned or managed clinics exposes us to risks including the loss of revenue and reduction of\nworking capital.\nAs our portfolio of company-owned or managed clinics has matured, we have placed more reliance on revenues from company-owned or managed clinics. As we execute on our re-\nfranchising strategy, we will place a greater reliance on revenue from franchise fees and royalties. As company-owned or managed clinics are sold to franchisees, the total amount of\nrevenue will decrease. In addition, the length of time to complete the re-franchising efforts could be in excess of our current expectations, and result in increased levels of general and\nadministrative expenses for longer than anticipated. We may experience insufficient working capital to fully implement our growth plans, and our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced net losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of net losses in the past, and while we have achieved profitability since 2018, our revenue may not grow and we may not maintain profitability in the\nfuture. Our ability to maintain profitability will be affected by the other risks and uncertainties described in this section and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. If we are not\nable to sustain or increase profitability, our business will be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nAny audit by the IRS with respect to our receipt of an employee retention credit (“ERC”) under The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act\ncould result in additional taxes or costs to our company.\nWe received an ERC pursuant to the CARES ACT. Please see Note 12, “Employee Retention Credit” in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K for a description of the ERC. Our eligibility to receive the ERC remains subject to audit by the IRS for a period of five years. If the IRS audits us during that time, it may\nfind that we were not eligible to receive some or all of the ERC, in which case we would be required to return some or all of the ERC to the IRS. Additionally, 20% of the ERC will\nbe paid to an outside third party as a consulting fee. In the event we are required to return some or all of the ERC, we may not be able to recoup the consulting fee.\n20\nTable of Contents\nRISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITION\nOur clinics and chiropractors compete for patients in a highly competitive environment that may make it more difficult to increase patient volumes and revenues.\nThe business of providing chiropractic services is highly competitive in each of the markets in which our clinics operate. The primary bases of such competition are quality of care,\nreputation, price of services, marketing and advertising strategy implementation, convenience, traffic flow, visibility of office locations, and hours of operation. Our clinics compete\nwith all other chiropractors in their local market. Many of those chiropractors have established practices and reputations in their markets. Some of these competitors and potential\ncompetitors may have financial resources, affiliation models, reputations or management expertise that provide them with competitive advantages over us, which may make it\ndifficult to compete against them. Our three largest multi-unit competitors are Airrosti, which currently operates 150 clinics; HealthSource Chiropractic, which currently operates 131\nclinics; and 100% Chiropractic, which currently operates 125 clinics. Two of these competitors are currently operating under an insurance-based model. In addition, a number of\nother chiropractic franchises and chiropractic practices that are attempting to duplicate or follow our business model are currently operating in our markets and in other parts of the\ncountry and may enter our existing markets in the future.\nOur success is dependent on the chiropractors who control the PCs, or PC owners, with whom we enter into management services agreements, and we may have difficulty\nlocating qualified chiropractors to replace PC owners.\nIn states that regulate the corporate practice of chiropractic, our chiropractic services are provided by legal entities organized under state laws as PCs and their equivalents. Each PC\nemploys or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices. Each of the PCs is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors, or medical professionals as state law may\nrequire, and we do not own any capital stock of any PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management services agreements with PCs, to provide\nto the PCs on an exclusive basis, all non-clinical services of the chiropractic practice. The PC owner is critical to the success of a clinic because he or she has control of all clinical\naspects of the practice of chiropractic and the provision of chiropractic services. Upon the departure of a PC owner, we may not be able to locate one or more suitably qualified\nlicensed chiropractors to hold the ownership interest in the PC and maintain the success of the departing PC owner.\nRISKS RELATED TO STATE REGULATION OF THE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF CHIROPRACTIC\nOur management services agreements, under which we provide non-clinical services to affiliated PCs, could be challenged by a state or chiropractor under laws regulating\nthe practice of chiropractic. Some state chiropractic boards have made inquiries concerning our business model or have proposed or adopted changes to their rules that\ncould be interpreted to pose a threat to our business model.\nThe laws of every state in which we operate contain restrictions on the practice of chiropractic and control over the provision of chiropractic services. The laws of many states where\nwe operate permit a chiropractor to conduct a chiropractic practice only as an individual, a member of a partnership or an employee of a PC, limited liability company or limited\nliability partnership. These laws typically prohibit chiropractors from splitting fees with non-chiropractors and prohibit non-chiropractic entities, such as chiropractic management\nservices organizations, from owning or operating chiropractic clinics or engaging in the practice of chiropractic and from employing chiropractors. The specific restrictions against\nthe corporate practice of chiropractic, as well as the interpretation of those restrictions by state regulatory authorities, vary from state to state. However, the restrictions are generally\ndesigned to prohibit a non-chiropractic entity from controlling or directing clinical care decision-making, engaging chiropractors to practice chiropractic or sharing professional fees.\nThe form of management agreement that we utilize, and that we recommend to our franchisees that are management service organizations, explicitly prohibits the management\nservice organization from controlling or directing clinical care decisions. However, there can be no assurance that all of our franchisees that are management service organizations\nwill strictly follow the provisions in our recommended form of management agreement. The laws of many states also prohibit chiropractic practitioners from paying any portion of\nfees received for chiropractic services in consideration for the referral of a patient. Any challenge to our contractual relationships with our affiliated PCs by chiropractors or\nregulatory authorities could result in a finding that could have a material adverse effect on our operations, such as voiding one or more management services agreements. Moreover,\nthe laws and regulatory environment may change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our management services agreements. We could be prevented from affiliating with\nchiropractor-owned PCs or providing comprehensive business services to them in one or more states. Please see “Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Environment - State\nregulations on corporate practice of chiropractic” for a description of certain of these actions by states, including state legislatures, state chiropractic regulatory bodies and a state\nattorney general, to regulate and restrict the corporate practice of chiropractic.\n21\nTable of Contents\nRISKS RELATED TO OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nProposed and expected new federal regulations under the Biden administration expanding the meaning of “joint employer” and evolving state laws increase our potential\nliability for employment law violations by our franchisees and the likelihood that we may be required to participate in collective bargaining with our franchisees’\nemployees.\nPlease see “Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Environment – Joint Employer Rules” for a detailed description of the background and current status of federal and state “joint\nemployer\" laws and regulations.\nAs discussed in the above-cited section, the proposed rules issued under the NLRA and the withdrawal of the Trump-era rules issued under the FLSA include or reinstate expansive\ndefinitions of “joint employer,” which could be used to deem a franchisor to be a joint employer of a franchisee’s employees. In the event of a finding of joint employer status under\nthe NLRA, a franchisor would be required to collectively bargain or otherwise deal with a union that does not represent the franchisor’s own employees, lose the protections against\nunion picketing of neutral employers in the event of a labor disagreement between a franchisee and a franchisee’s employees, and share in liability for labor and employment\nviolations committed by a franchisee. Under the reversion to a more expansive definition of “joint employer” under the FLSA, a franchisor could be held jointly liable with its\nfranchisee for minimum wages and overtime pay violations by the franchisee, depending on the extent of control and supervision the franchisor is able to exercise over the\nfranchisee’s employees. Furthermore, there is an expectation that new rules will be issued by the EEOC, similarly expanding “joint liability” with respect to the enforcement of anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\nSuch expansions of joint employer liability have implications for our business model. We could have responsibility for damages, reinstatement, back pay and penalties in connection\nwith labor law and employment discrimination violations by our franchisees over whom we have limited control. Furthermore, it may be easier for our franchisees’ employees to\norganize into unions, require us to participate in collective bargaining with those employees, provide those employees and their union representatives with bargaining power to\nrequest that we have our franchisees raise wages, and make it more expensive and less profitable to operate a franchised clinic.\nSimilarly, state laws, such as California’s AB-5 and similar laws adopted or being considered for adoption in other states, raise concerns with respect to the expansion of joint liability\nto the franchise industry. While AB-5 is not a franchise-specific law and does not address joint employer liability, a significant concern exists in the franchise industry that an\nexpansive interpretation of AB-5 or similar law could be used to hold franchisors jointly liable for the labor law violations of its franchisees. Courts addressing this issue have come\nto differing conclusions, and it remains uncertain as to how the joint employer issue will finally be resolved in California, although potential new federal laws or regulations may\nultimately be controlling on this issue. Furthermore, there have been private lawsuits in which parties have alleged that a franchisor and its franchisee “jointly employ” the\nfranchisee’s staff, that the franchisor is responsible for the franchisees’ staff (under theories of apparent agency, ostensible agency, or actual agency), or otherwise.\nEvolving labor and employment laws, rules and regulations, and theories of liability could result in expensive litigation and potential claims against us as a franchisor for labor and\nemployment-related and other liabilities that have historically been borne by franchisees. This could negatively impact the franchise business model, which could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increased regulatory focus on the establishment of fair franchise practices could increase our risk of liability in disputes with franchisees and the risk of enforcement\nactions and penalties.\nRecently, there has been an increased focus on unfair franchise practices. A new policy from the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (“NASAA”) rejects the\nuse of required representations or waivers of claims by franchisees in franchise agreements for the purpose of insulating a franchisor from liability in disputes related to alleged fraud\nor misrepresentations during the offer and sale of a franchise. It is expected that state regulators will follow NASAA’s guidance and limit their use, as California has already done.\nWe risk exposure to unfair trade practice claims by state regulators if we try to use a franchisee’s representations in a manner that offends NASAA’s policy. The use of such offending\nrepresentations also could increase the likelihood of successful lawsuits against us by our franchisees over claims of fraud or misrepresentation. Bills also have been introduced in\nCongress from time to time providing for protections of franchisee rights, including certain currently pending bills seeking to establish what are described as fair franchise practices.\nCompliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase, and non-compliance with such laws could result in penalties or enforcement actions against\nus. Please see “Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Environment – Regulation relating to franchising” for a description of other federal and state regulation related to franchising.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make\nsignificant changes to our operations.\nWe, our franchisees and the chiropractor-owned PCs to which we and our franchisees provide management services are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and\nregulations, including: (i) federal and state laws governing the franchisor-franchisee relationship; (ii) state regulations on the practice of chiropractic; (iii) federal and state laws\ngoverning the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of sensitive personal information; (iv) federal and state laws which contain anti-kickback and fee-splitting\nprovisions and restrictions on referrals; (v) the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state laws that restrict the methods that we and third-party collection companies\nmay use to contact and seek payment from patients regarding past due accounts; and (v) federal and state labor laws, including wage and hour laws.\nMany of the above laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, our franchisees and our affiliated PCs are ambiguous, have not been definitively interpreted by courts or regulatory\nauthorities and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may not be able to predict how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or applied by courts and\nregulatory authorities, and some of our activities could be challenged. In addition, we must consistently monitor changes in the laws and regulations that govern our operations.\nFurthermore, a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations. Although we\nhave tried to structure our business and contractual relationships in compliance with these laws, rules and regulations in all material respects, if any aspect of our operations were\nfound to violate applicable laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to significant fines or other penalties, required to cease operations in a particular jurisdiction, prevented\nfrom commencing operations in a particular state or otherwise be required to revise the structure of our business or legal arrangements. Our efforts to comply with these laws, rules\nand regulations may impose significant costs and burdens, and failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in fines or other charges being imposed on us.\nOur chiropractors are subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards which, if not complied with, could adversely affect our business.\nThe chiropractors who work in our system are subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation agencies.\nCompliance with these guidelines and standards is often required by our contracts with our chiropractors, patients and franchise owners (and their contractual relationships) and serve\nto maintain our reputation. The guidelines and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. New or changed guidelines or\nstandards may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, a review of our business by accreditation authorities could result in a determination that could adversely\naffect our operations.\nWe, along with our affiliated PCs and their chiropractors, are subject to malpractice and other similar claims and may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance\nagainst these claims.\nThe provision of chiropractic services by chiropractors entails an inherent risk of potential malpractice and other similar claims. While we do not have responsibility for compliance\nby affiliated PCs and their chiropractors with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to chiropractors, claims, suits or complaints relating to services provided at the\noffices of our franchisees or affiliated PCs may be asserted against us. We have experienced a number of malpractice claims since our founding in March 2010, which we have\ndefended or are vigorously defending and do not expect their outcome to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The assertion or\noutcome of these claims could result in higher administrative and legal expenses, including settlement costs or litigation damages. Our current minimum professional liability\ninsurance coverage required for our franchisees, affiliated PCs and company-owned clinics is $1.0 million per occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate. In addition, we have a\ncorporate business owner’s policy with coverage of $2.0 million per occurrence and $4.0 million in annual aggregate. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance, our franchisees\nor franchisee doctors fail to name our company as an additional insured party, or if there is an increase in the future cost of insurance to us and the chiropractors who provide\nchiropractic services or an increase in the amount we have to self-insure, there may be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nEvents or rumors relating to our brand names or our ability to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties could significantly\nimpact our business.\nRecognition of our brand names, including “THE JOINT CHIROPRACTIC,” and the association of those brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive chiropractic maintenance\ncare, are an integral part of our business. The occurrence of any events or rumors that cause patients to no longer associate the brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive\nchiropractic maintenance care may materially adversely affect the value of the brand names and demand for chiropractic services at our franchisees or their affiliated PCs.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality\nprocedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Litigation may\nbe necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon\nsuch third party’s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could\nbe adversely affected as a result.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nOur failure to comply with applicable federal and state data privacy and security laws could result in civil or criminal sanctions or damage awards, and the proliferation of\nsuch laws increases our costs of compliance.\nThe data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure,\nretention, and security of personal information, including health-related information. While we have determined that we are not currently regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA\nand thus are not subject to its requirements or penalties, any entity may be prosecuted under HIPAA’s criminal provisions either directly or under aiding-and-abetting or conspiracy\nprinciples. Consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information\nfrom a HIPAA-covered healthcare provider that has not satisfied HIPAA’s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information. Even when entities are not\ncovered by HIPAA, the FTC has taken the position that a failure to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or\naffecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the\nsensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. The\nFTC has broad authority to seek monetary redress for affected consumers and injunctive relief.\nIn addition, many states impose restrictions related to the confidentiality of personal information that apply more broadly than HIPAA. Please see “Part I, Item 1 - Business -\nRegulatory Environment – HIPAA and State Privacy and Breach Notification Rules” for a description of some of these state privacy rules. Such information may include certain\nidentifying information and financial information of our patients. These state laws may impose notification requirements in the event of a breach of such personal information.\nViolations of these laws may result in criminal, civil and administrative sanctions and also may provide individuals with a private right of action with respect to disclosures of\npersonal information. Failure to comply with such data confidentiality, security and breach notification laws may result in substantial monetary penalties or awards of damages.\nWe expect that the regulatory focus on privacy, security and data use issues will continue to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information will\nexpand and become more complex. Such new privacy laws add additional requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk and require additional investment in resources for\ncompliance programs.\nOur business model depends on proprietary and third-party management information systems that we use to, among other things, track financial and operating\nperformance of our clinics, and any failure to successfully design and maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on integrated management information systems, some of which are provided by third parties, and standardized procedures for operational and financial information,\npatient records and billing operations. In 2021, we replaced, upgraded and rolled out our new IT platform, and any problems with system performance could cause disruptions in our\nbusiness operations, given the pervasive impact of the new system on our processes. In general, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications, data breaches or expenses in\nreplacing, upgrading, implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems regularly require modifications, improvements or replacements\nthat may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of skilled information\ntechnology specialists to assist us in creating, implementing and supporting these systems. Our failure to successfully design, implement and maintain all of our systems could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement, upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our reputation and business\ncould be materially adversely affected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe increasingly use electronic means to interact with our customers and collect, maintain and store individually identifiable information, including, but not limited to, personal\nfinancial information and health-related information. Despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems,\nand those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data,\nprogramming and/or human errors or other similar events. Please see “Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Environment – HIPAA and State Privacy and Breach Notification Rules”\nfor a description of the November 2022 data breach suffered by one of our vendors, which resulted in the release of certain information with respect to our patients and employees.\nAdditionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels as well as by\ncertain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry organization. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time-to-time new privacy and\nsecurity requirements that may apply to our businesses. Compliance with evolving privacy and security laws, requirements, and regulations may result in cost increases due to\nnecessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models and the development of new administrative processes. They also may impose further restrictions on\nour collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that is housed in one or more of our databases. Noncompliance with privacy laws, financial industry group\nrequirements or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal, sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or by one\nof our vendors, could have material adverse effects on our business, operations, reputation and financial condition, including decreased revenue; material fines and penalties;\nincreased financial processing fees; compensatory, statutory, punitive or other damages; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief whether by court or\nconsent order.\nIf our security systems are breached, we may face civil liability and public perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect\nour ability to attract and retain patients.\nTechniques used to gain unauthorized access to corporate data systems are constantly evolving, and there is a potential for increased cyber-attacks and security challenges as our\nemployees and employees of our vendors and franchisees work remotely from non-corporate managed networks. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to\ndata pertaining to our patients, including credit card and debit card information and other personally identifiable information. Our systems, which are supported by our own systems\nand those of third-party vendors, are vulnerable to computer malware, trojans, viruses, worms, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, attempts to access our servers in\nan unauthorized manner, or other attacks on and disruptions of our and third-party vendor computer systems (as in the case of the November 2022 data breach of a vendor’s computer\nsystem referenced in the preceding risk factor), any of which could lead to system interruptions, delays, or shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized access to\npersonally identifiable information. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs on our systems or a vendor’s systems, we could face civil liability and reputational damage,\neither of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients. We also could be required to expend resources, time and/or effort to mitigate the breach of security\nand to address related matters, as we did in the case of the aforementioned November 2022 data breach, although we are entitled to indemnification under the contract with the vendor\nfor costs incurred in the case of the November 2022 breach.\nWe may not be able to effectively control the unauthorized actions of third parties who may have access to the patient data we collect. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to\nmaintain the security of data relating to our patients and employees, and to comply with our posted privacy policy, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations,\nindustry standards and contractual provisions to which we may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nall of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose patients, revenue and employees.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept.\nWe accept payments through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in\nthose fees would require us to either increase the prices we charge for our services, which could cause us to lose patients and revenue, or absorb an increase in our operating expenses,\neither of which could harm our operating results.\nIf we or any of our processing vendors have problems with our billing software, or the billing software malfunctions, it could have an adverse effect on patient satisfaction and could\ncause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly, and as a\nresult, we do not automatically process monthly membership fees to our patients’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all, or there are issues with financial insolvency of our third-party\nvendors or other unanticipated problems or events, we could lose revenue, which would harm our operating results.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to\nmake it more difficult for us to comply. Based on the self-assessment completed as of January 22, 2024, we are currently in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard, or PCI DSS, the payment card industry’s security standard for companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, credit and debit card\nholders and credit and debit card transactions. There is no guarantee that we will maintain PCI DSS compliance. Our failure to comply fully with PCI DSS in the future could violate\npayment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply\nfully also could subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability and could result in the suspension or loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Although we\ndo not store credit card information and we do not have access to our patients’ credit card information, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper\nuse of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit\ncard-related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback or refund rates at\nacceptable levels, credit and debit card companies may increase our transaction fees, impose monthly fines until resolved or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in\nour credit and debit card fees could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our service to offset the increase. The termination of our\nability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe have restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties,\nincluding loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOn September 26, 2023, we restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (the “Restated Periods”). The determination to restate the financial statements for the Restated Periods was made by our Audit Committee\nand our Board of Directors upon management’s recommendation following the identification of errors related to our method of accounting for the reacquisition of regional developer\nrights and transfer pricing adjustments for our VIEs. Our management, after consultation with our independent registered accountants, concluded that our previously issued financial\nstatements for the Restated Periods should no longer be relied upon. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 has been amended by Form\n10-K/A filed on September 26, 2023 to, among other things, reflect the restatement of our financial statements for the Restated Periods.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could materially adversely affect\nour financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the risk of\npotential stockholder litigation. If lawsuits are filed, we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of such litigation. Likewise, such events might cause\na diversion of our management’s time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, the\nrestatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.\nShort-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet may drive down the market price of our common stock and could result in class action lawsuits.\nShort selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short\nseller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares. Because it is in the short\nseller's best interests for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding an issuer, its business\nprospects, and similar matters which may create a negative depiction of the company. This information is often widely distributed, including through platforms that mainly serve as\nhosts seeking advertising revenue. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are thus susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap stocks can be particularly vulnerable to\nsuch short seller attacks.\nWe may be subject to short selling strategies that may drive down the market price of our common stock. In 2021, we were the target of negative allegations posted on an internet\nplatform designed to advise short sellers, which precipitated a decline in the\n26\nTable of Contents\nprice of our stock. Shortly thereafter, several plaintiffs' law firms announced investigations into potential securities laws violations based on these allegations. While we believe these\nallegations are without merit, and no litigation has been commenced to date regarding such allegations, we still face the potential (albeit a diminishing one, given the passage of time)\nfor litigation to be initiated against us. While we would vigorously defend against any such litigation, regardless of outcome, litigation can be costly and time-consuming, divert the\nattention of our management team, adversely impact our reputation and brand, and if a plaintiff claim were successful, could result in significant liability, all of which could harm our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price and our share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale or exchange.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nThese sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem\nappropriate. As of December 31, 2023, we had 14,751,633 outstanding shares of common stock and are authorized to sell up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. The trading\nvolume of shares of our common stock averaged approximately 136,520 shares per day during the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, sales of even small amounts of\nshares of our common stock by existing stockholders may drive down the trading price of our common stock.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of\nmoney available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware\nlaw. In addition, we have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our Board of\nDirectors. Under the terms of such indemnification agreements, we are required to indemnify each of our directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state\nof Delaware, if the basis of the indemnitee’s involvement was by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of our company or any of its subsidiaries or was\nserving at our request in an official capacity for another entity. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful\nthird-party claims and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nThe delayed filing of our quarterly report has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which\ncould adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3\nuntil one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are\neligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such\ntransaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nOur Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) is responsible for cybersecurity within our company, including information technology risks, controls, strategies and procedures. The\nCybersecurity Subcommittee of the Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity for our company and meets with the CTO at least quarterly to discuss the status of cybersecurity efforts\nas well as any security incidents. Cybersecurity Subcommittee materials are provided to the Audit Committee as well as the full Board of Directors. The Board of Directors believes\nthat a strong cyber strategy based on industry accepted best practices is vital to protect our business, customers and assets.\nA dedicated team of technology professionals works throughout the year to monitor all matters of risk relating to cybersecurity. We have begun our certification process for the\nglobally recognized International Organization for Standardization certification for Information Security Management Systems (ISO 27001) that we expect to achieve by the second\nquarter of 2024. Additionally, we operate and are compliant under the following provisions: HIPAA attestation for the HIPAA Security Rule and the Health Information Technology\nfor Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) Breach Notification requirements.\n27\nTable of Contents\nVendors that have access to our information are required to manage such information in accordance with laws and appropriate privacy and security standards. Standards are applied\non a per-contract basis and include requirements to have an information security program and report to us any incidents in which its confidential information or systems are\ncompromised. Depending on the nature of the vendors' access to our information, we monitor and evaluate the controls and governance established with the vendors ranging from a\ncontinuous cadence to at least quarterly.\nWe annually assess our cybersecurity programs against third-party requirements, including HIPAA and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). We test multiple aspects of cybersecurity\nregularly, including annual pen testing over our proprietary information systems and have historically tested annually and beginning 2024 will test semi-annually our technical\nrecovery and incident response procedures.\nWe maintain a robust privacy compliance program. Employees receive periodic email communications, which train them to detect and report malware, ransomware and other\nmalicious software and social engineering attempts that may compromise our information technology systems. In the first quarter of 2024, we will be implementing a best in class\nsecurity awareness training system and a quarterly training program for all employees.\nCurrently, we rely on an established major incident management and communication process to address any potential cybersecurity incidents. This established process includes the\nuse of third party partnerships to make available the distinct skill sets needed to assist in properly responding to any cybersecurity threat. We are in process of establishing defined\nresponse procedures to effectively address any cyber threat that may occur regardless of the safeguards in place that minimize the chance of a successful cyberattack. The response\nprocedures will be designed to identify, analyze, contain and remediate such cyber incidents expeditiously. These procedures and approach to safeguard our information and assets\nwill be continuously monitored by management and updated to evolve with the current cyber landscape in alignment with the ISO 27001 standard mentioned above.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe lease the property for our corporate headquarters and all of the properties on which we own or manage clinics. As of December 31, 2023, we leased 138 facilities in which we\noperate or intend to operate clinics. We are obligated under two additional leases for facilities in which we have ceased clinic operations.\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 16767 N. Perimeter Center Drive, Suite 110, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260. The term of our lease for this location expires on December 31,\n2025. The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial, accounting, treasury, marketing, operations, human resources, information systems support and\nlegal.\nWe are also obligated under non-cancellable leases for the clinics which we own or manage. Our clinics are on average 1,200 square feet. Our clinic leases generally have an initial\nterm of five years, include one to two options to renew for terms of five years, and require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance\ncharges and other operating costs.\nITEM 3.

[Reserved]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Information pertaining to fiscal year 2021 was\nincluded in our Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2021 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position\nand Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on September 26, 2023.\nOverview\nWe are a rapidly growing franchisor and operator of chiropractic clinics that uses a private pay, non-insurance, cash-based model. We seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic\ncare in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry. We delivered over 13.6 million patient visits in 2023, up from 12.2 million patient visits in\n2022, generating over $488.0 million and $435 million of system-wide sales, respectively, across our highly franchised network. We will continue the rapid and franchised focused\nexpansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and potentially abroad. We saw over 932,000 new patients in 2023, with approximately 36% of those new\npatients visiting a chiropractor for the first time. We are not only increasing our percentage of market share, but are expanding the chiropractic market.\nKey Performance Measures. We receive monthly performance reports from our system and our clinics, which include key performance indicators per clinic, including gross sales,\ncomparable same-store sales growth (“Comp Sales”), number of new patients, conversion percentage and member attrition. In addition, we review monthly reporting related to\nsystem-wide sales, clinic openings, clinic license sales and various earnings metrics in the aggregate and per clinic. We believe these indicators provide us with useful data with which\nto measure our performance and to measure our franchisees’ and clinics’ performance. System-wide Comp Sales include the sales from both company-owned or managed clinics and\nfranchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. While gross sales from franchised clinics are not recorded as\nrevenues by us, management believes the information is important in understanding the overall brand’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which we calculate\nand record royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.\nKey Clinic Development Trends. As of December 31, 2023, we and our franchisees operated or managed 935 clinics, of which 800 were operated or managed by franchisees and 135\nwere operated as company-owned or managed clinics. We and our franchisees opened 114 clinics during 2023, 104 franchised clinics and 10 company-owned or managed clinics.\nThis compares to 137 clinics opened in 2022, 121 franchised clinics and 16 company-owned or managed clinics. Of the 135 company-owned or managed clinics at December 31,\n2023, 65 were constructed and developed by us, and 70 were acquired from franchisees.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur current strategy is to grow through the sale and development of additional franchises. After evaluating options for improvement, during 2023 the board authorized management to\ninitiate a plan to re-franchise or sell the majority of our company-owned or managed clinics. This refined strategy will leverage our greatest strength – our capacity to build a\nfranchise – to drive long-term growth for both our franchisees and The Joint as a public company. We have created a robust framework for the re-franchising effort, organizing\nclinics into clusters, and generating comprehensive disclosure packets for marketing efficiency. We have given initial preference to existing franchisees and have received significant\ninterest to date. Our goal will be to generate significant proceeds that will provide us with value creating capital allocation opportunities. These opportunities could include, but are\nnot limited to, reinvestment in the brand and related marketing, continued investment in our IT platforms, the repurchase of RD territories, and/or a stock repurchase program.\nThe number of franchise licenses sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 55, compared with 75 and 156 licenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. We ended 2023 with 17 regional developers who were responsible for 51% of the 55 licenses sold during the year. This strong result reflects the power of the regional\ndeveloper program to accelerate the number of clinics sold, and eventually opened, across the country.\nWe believe that we continue to have a sound business concept and will benefit from the fundamental changes taking place in the manner in which Americans access chiropractic care\nand their growing interest in seeking effective, affordable natural solutions for general wellness. These trends join with the preference we have seen among chiropractic doctors to\nreject the insurance-based model to produce a combination that benefits the consumer and the service provider alike. We believe that these forces create an important opportunity to\naccelerate the growth of our network.\nDefault Under Credit Agreement\nOn September 8, 2023, JP Morgan Chase waived, on a one-time only basis, a default that occurred under the Credit Agreement. The default occurred as of the close of business on\nSeptember 6, 2023. The default resulted from our inability to deliver in a timely manner the financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30,\n2023 (the “2023 Q2 10-Q”). Our inability to produce and file the 2023 Q2 10-Q in a timely manner (which filing constitutes delivery to JP Morgan Chase of our financial statements)\nwas the result of the discovery of errors in the GAAP accounting treatment for re-acquired regional developer rights and for transfer pricing for our VIEs. JP Morgan Chase waived\nthis default until September 30, 2023. The filing of our 2023 Q2 10-Q on September 26, 2023 cured the default.\nRecent Events\nRecent events that may impact our business include unfavorable global economic or political conditions, such as the Ukraine War, the Israel-Gaza conflict, labor shortages, and\ninflation and other cost increases. We anticipate that 2024 will continue to be a volatile macroeconomic environment.\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs. In 2022 and 2023, clinics owned or managed by us or our franchisees were negatively impacted by labor\nshortages and wage increases, which increased our general and administrative expenses. Further, should we fail to continue to increase our wages competitively in response to\nincreasing wage rates, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our patient service to suffer. While we anticipate that these continued headwinds can be partially mitigated\nby pricing actions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to take such pricing actions. A continued increase in labor costs could have an adverse effect on our\noperating costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the increase in interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will continue to remain elevated may adversely affect patients' financial conditions, resulting in reduced\nspending on our services. While the impact of these factors continues to remain uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. These and other uncertainties with respect to these recent events could result in changes to our current expectations.\nSignificant Events and/or Recent Developments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023:\n• Comp Sales of clinics that have been open for at least 13 full months increased 4%.\n• Comp Sales for mature clinics open 48 months or more decreased 1%.\n30\nTable of Contents\n• System-wide sales for all clinics open for any amount of time grew 12% to $488.0 million.\nWe saw over 932,000 new patients in 2023, compared with 845,000 new patients in 2022, with approximately 36% of those new patients having never been to a chiropractor before.\nWe are not only increasing our percentage of market share, but expanding the chiropractic market. These factors, along with continued leverage of our operating expenses, drove\nimprovement in our bottom line.\nOn November 6, 2023, we discussed certain strategic initiatives with the Board of Directors and were authorized to initiate a plan to re-franchise the majority of our corporate-owned\nor managed clinics with plans to retain a small portion of high-performing clinics. Based on the timing and varied scope of the initiative, we are unable to estimate the financial\nimpact of such plans.\nIn October 2023, we entered into two separate letters of intent to sell two of our company-owned or managed clinics that were part of the approximately 10% of clinics identified for\nsale and classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023 for a combined total sales price of $185,000. The sales are expected to close during the first quarter of 2024, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nOn June 15, 2023, we entered into an agreement under which we repurchased the right to develop franchises in various counties in Wisconsin. The total consideration for the\ntransaction was $1.0 million. We carried an upfront regional developer fee liability balance associated with this transaction of $0.3 million, representing the unrecognized fee\ncollected upon the execution of the regional developer agreement. We accounted for the termination of development rights associated with unsold or undeveloped franchises as a\ncancellation, and the associated upfront regional developer fee liability was netted against the aggregate purchase price. We recognized the net amount of $0.7 million as a general\nand administrative expense on June 15, 2023.\nOn May 22, 2023, we entered into an Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreement under which we repurchased from the sellers three operating franchised clinics in California. We\noperate the franchises as company-managed clinics. The total purchase price for the transaction was $1,188,764, less $28,997 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total purchase\nconsideration of $1,159,767. Based on the terms of the purchase agreement, the acquisition has been treated as an asset purchase.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we constructed and developed 10 new corporate clinics.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new clinic sales, openings, closures, markets in which they are contained\nand related expenses, general economic conditions, cost inflation, labor shortages, consumer confidence in the economy, consumer preferences, competitive factors, and disease\nepidemics and other health-related concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSignificant Accounting Polices and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. We base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of significant accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.\nAcquisitions\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase\nprice over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. When an acquisition is accounted for in accordance with the acquisition of assets rather\nthan a business, goodwill is not recognized and instead, any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is allocated to certain assets on the basis of\nrelative fair values. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nand the related useful lives of the acquired assets, when applicable, as of the acquisition date.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and\nmember relationships, revenue growth rates, the period of time the acquired member relationships will continue to be used, anticipated member attrition rates, and discount rates used\nto determine\n31\nTable of Contents\nthe present value of estimated future cash flows. We engage third-party valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value associated with our acquisitions and related\nidentifiable intangible assets. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated\nto the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of re-acquired franchise rights and customer relationships. We amortize the fair value of re-acquired franchise rights over the remaining\ncontractual terms of the re-acquired franchise rights at the time of the acquisition, which range from one to ten years. The fair value of customer relationships is amortized over their\nestimated useful life which ranges from two to four years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of franchises treated as a business\ncombination under GAAP. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. As required, we perform an\nannual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its carrying value. No impairments of goodwill were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. We look primarily\nto estimated undiscounted future cash flows in the assessment of whether or not long-lived assets are recoverable. We record an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the\nasset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2023, intangible assets and property and equipment, net related to a closed clinic and asset\ngroups determined to not be recoverable with a total carrying amount of approximately $3.0 million was written down to $1.2 million. As a result, we recorded a noncash impairment\nloss of approximately $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, an operating lease ROU asset related to a closed clinic with\na total carrying amount of $0.2 million was written down to their fair value of zero. As a result, we recorded a noncash impairment loss of approximately $0.2 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based payments by recognizing compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We determine the estimated grant-\ndate fair value of restricted shares using the closing price on the date of the grant and the grant-date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. In order to\ncalculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding the components of the model, including risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield and\nexpected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation. We recognize compensation costs ratably over the period of service using the\nstraight-line method. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical and forecasted turnover, which is approximately 5%.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue through our company-owned and managed clinics and through royalties, franchise fees, advertising fund contributions, IT related income and computer\nsoftware fees from our franchisees.\nRevenues from Company-Owned or Managed Clinics. We earn revenue from clinics that we own and operate or manage throughout the United States. In those states where we own\nand operate the clinic, revenues are recognized when services are performed. We offer a variety of membership and wellness packages which feature discounted pricing as compared\nwith our single-visit pricing. Amounts collected in advance for membership and wellness packages are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the service is performed.\nAny unused visits associated with monthly memberships are recognized on a month-to-month basis. We recognize a contract liability (or a deferred revenue liability) related to the\nprepaid treatment plans for which we have an ongoing performance obligation. We recognize this contract liability, and recognize revenue, as the patient consumes his or her visits\nrelated to the package and we perform the services. If we determine that it is not subject to unclaimed property laws for the portion of wellness package that we do not expect to be\nredeemed (referred to as “breakage”), then we recognize breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights by the patient.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRoyalties and Advertising Fund Revenue. We collect royalties from our franchisees, as stipulated in the franchise agreement, equal to 7% of gross sales and a marketing and\nadvertising fee currently equal to 2% of gross sales. Royalties, including franchisee contributions to advertising funds, are calculated as a percentage of clinic sales over the term of\nthe franchise agreement. The revenue accounting standard provides an exception for the recognition of sales-based royalties promised in exchange for a license (which generally\nrequires a reporting entity to estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in the transaction price). The franchise agreement royalties, inclusive of\nadvertising fund contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to our performance obligation under the franchise agreement and are recognized as franchisee\nclinic level sales occur. Royalties and marketing and advertising fees are collected bi-monthly two working days after each sales period has ended.\nFranchise Fees. We require the entire non-refundable initial franchise fee to be paid upon execution of a franchise agreement, which typically has an initial term of 10 years. Initial\nfranchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. Our services under the franchise agreement include training of franchisees and\nstaff, site selection, construction/vendor management and ongoing operations support. We provide no financing to franchisees and generally offer no guarantees on their behalf. The\nservices we provide are highly interrelated with the franchise license and as such are considered to represent a single performance obligation.\nSoftware Fees. We collect a monthly fee from our franchisees for use of our proprietary chiropractic software, computer support, and internet services support. These fees are\nrecognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement.\nRegional Developer Fees\nWe have a regional developer program where regional developers are granted an exclusive geographical territory and commit to a minimum development obligation within that\ndefined territory. Regional developer fees are non-refundable and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the regional developer agreement and recognized as a decrease to\nfranchise and regional developer cost of revenues.\nIn addition, we pay regional developers fees, which are funded by the initial franchise fees collected from franchisees upon the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical\nterritory, and a royalty of 3% of sales generated by franchised clinics in their exclusive geographical territory. Fees related to the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical\nterritory are initially deferred as deferred franchise costs and are recognized as an expense in franchise cost of revenues when the respective revenue is recognized, which is generally\nover the term of the related franchise agreement. Royalties of 3% of gross sales generated by franchised clinics in their regions are also recognized as franchise cost of revenues as\nfranchisee clinic level sales occur, which is funded by the 7% royalties we collect from the franchisees in their regions. Certain regional developer agreements result in the regional\ndeveloper acquiring the rights to existing royalty streams from clinics already open in the respective territory. In those instances, the revenue associated from the sale of the royalty\nstream is recognized over the remaining life of the respective franchise agreements.\nLeases\nThe accounting guidance for leases requires lessees to recognize an ROU asset and a lease liability in the balance sheet for most leases. The lease liability is measured at the present\nvalue of the fixed lease payments over the lease term and the ROU asset is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the\nlessee’s initial direct costs. Certain leases include one or more renewal options, generally for the same period as the initial term of the lease. The exercise of lease renewal options is\ngenerally at our sole discretion and, as such, we typically determine that exercise of these renewal options is not reasonably certain. As a result, we do not include the renewal option\nperiod in the expected lease term and the associated lease payments are not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability. When available, we use the rate implicit\nin the lease to discount lease payments; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for substantially all of our leases. In such cases, we estimate our incremental\nborrowing rate as the interest rate we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term, with similar collateral as in the lease, and in a similar economic\nenvironment. We estimate these rates using available evidence such as rates imposed by third-party lenders in recent financings or observable risk-free interest rate and credit spreads\nfor commercial debt of a similar duration, with credit spreads correlating to our estimated creditworthiness.\nFor operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date it takes possession of\nthe leased property. Pre-opening costs are recorded as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments, such as percentage rentals based on location sales,\nperiodic adjustments for inflation, reimbursement of real estate taxes, any variable common area maintenance and any other variable\n33\nTable of Contents\ncosts associated with the leased property are expensed as incurred and are also included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated income statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for\nthe expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nWe record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making\nthis determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. It is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed\nwhen there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. Forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results.\nTherefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment.\nIn addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization\nof our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing temporary differences, the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax\nplanning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. Each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence;\nthis evaluation involves assumptions about future activity. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ from the amounts we have recorded.\nSignificant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions when we believe that the full amount of the associated\ntax benefit may not be realized. If we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established previously or pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be an effect on our\nincome tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe regularly assess the tax risk of our tax return filing positions, and we have identified $1.2 million and $1.3 million in uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nAccounting Standards Codification 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”), governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other\nclaims. We record an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the\npotential loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount\nwithin the range. Moreover, even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e., more than\nremote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us. Legal costs to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are\nexpensed as such costs are incurred.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial results encompasses our consolidated results and results of our two business segments: Corporate Clinics and Franchise\nOperations.\nTotal Revenues\nComponents of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n34\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nRevenues:\nRevenues from company-owned or managed clinics $ 70,718,880 $ 59,422,294 $ 11,296,586 19.0 %\nRoyalty fees 29,160,831 26,190,531 2,970,300 11.3 %\nFranchise fees 2,882,895 2,441,325 441,570 18.1 %\nAdvertising fund revenue 8,321,043 7,456,696 864,347 11.6 %\nSoftware fees 5,086,562 4,290,739 795,823 18.5 %\nOther revenues 1,526,145 1,450,725 75,420 5.2 %\nTotal revenues $ 117,696,356 $ 101,252,310 $ 16,444,046 16.2 %\nThe reasons for the significant changes in our components of total revenues were as follows:\nConsolidated Results\n• Total revenues increased by $16.4 million, primarily due to the continued expansion and revenue growth of our franchise base, continued same-store sales growth and\nexpansion of our corporate-owned or managed clinics portfolio.\nCorporate Clinics\n• Revenues from company-owned or managed clinics increased, primarily due to the expansion of our corporate-owned or managed clinics portfolio. As of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, there were 135 and 126 company-owned or managed clinics in operation, respectively.\nFranchise Operations\n• Royalty fees and advertising fund revenue increased due to an increase in the number of franchised clinics in operation during 2023, along with continued sales growth in\nexisting franchised clinics. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 800 and 712 franchised clinics in operation, respectively.\n• Franchise fees revenue increased due to the continued increase in active franchise licenses and the impact of accelerated revenue recognition resulting from the terminated\nfranchise license agreements, with 21 and 17 franchise license agreements terminated during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n• Software fees revenue increased due to an increase in our franchised clinic base and the related revenue recognition over the term of the franchise agreement as described\nabove.\n• Other revenues primarily consisted of merchant income associated with credit card transactions.\nCost of Revenues\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nCost of Revenues $ 10,546,558 $ 9,171,063 $ 1,375,495 15.0 %\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, the total cost of revenues increased due to an increase in regional developer royalties\nand sales commissions of $1.3 million and an increase in website hosting costs of $0.1 million.\n35\nTable of Contents\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nSelling and Marketing Expenses $ 16,541,990 $ 13,962,709 $ 2,579,281 18.5 %\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by an increase in advertising\nfund expenditures from a larger franchise base and increased local marketing expenditures from a larger company-owned or managed clinic base.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses $ 8,582,203 $ 6,646,622 $ 1,935,581 29.1 %\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to\ndepreciation expenses associated with the expansion of our company-owned or managed clinics portfolio.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses $ 81,466,088 $ 70,233,447 $ 11,232,641 16.0 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increases in the\nfollowing to support continued clinic count and revenue growth in both operating segments: (i) payroll and related expenses of $8.2 million; (ii) general overhead and administrative\nexpenses of $2.7 million; (iii) professional and advisory fees of $1.0 million primarily related to the accounting restatement; and (iv) software and maintenance expense of $0.4\nmillion; offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $1.1 million. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were flat at 69% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNet Loss on Disposition or Impairment\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nNet Loss on Disposition or Impairment $ 2,632,604 $ 410,215 $ 2,222,389 541.8 %\nNet loss on disposition or impairment increased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the\nimpairment charges of long-lived assets resulting from the planned sale or\n36\nTable of Contents\ndetermined closure of certain company-owned or managed clinics classified as held for sale and those classified as held and used that were determined to not be recoverable.\n(Loss) Income from Operations\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\n(Loss) Income from Operations $ (2,073,087) $ 828,254 $ (2,901,341) (350.3)%\nConsolidated Results\nConsolidated income from operations decreased by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the\nimpairment charges in the corporate clinics and increases in expenses from unallocated corporate segments discussed below.\nCorporate Clinics\nOur corporate clinics segment had loss from operations of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease in income of $2.6 million compared to income from\noperations of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to:\n• A $13.9 million increase in operating expenses primarily due to the increases in the following: (i) payroll-related expenses of $5.6 million due to a higher head count to\nsupport the expansion of our corporate clinic portfolio and general wage increases to remain competitive in the current labor market; (ii) depreciation and amortization\nexpense of $1.9 million primarily associated with the expansion of our company-owned or managed clinics portfolio; (iii) selling and marketing expenses due to increased\nlocal marketing expenditures by the company-owned or managed clinics of $1.9 million; (iv) general overhead and administrative expenses to support the expansion of our\ncorporate clinic portfolio of $2.3 million; and (v) an increase in impairment loss of $2.2 million; partially offset by\n• An increase in revenues of $11.3 million from company-owned or managed clinics primarily due to the expansion of our corporate-owned or managed clinics portfolio.\nFranchise Operations\nOur franchise operations segment had income from operations of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.0 million, compared to income from\noperations of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to:\n• An increase of $5.2 million in total revenues due to an increase in the number of franchised clinics in operation, along with continued sales growth in existing franchised\nclinics; partially offset by\n• An increase of $1.4 million in cost of revenues, primarily due to an increase in regional developer royalties and website hosting costs. An increase of $0.8 million in operating\nexpenses, primarily due to an increase in (i) selling and marketing expenses resulting from a larger franchise base of $0.8 million, (ii) payroll-related expenses of $1.0 million,\nand (iii) travel costs of $0.1 million; offset by a reduction in acquisition related expenses of $1.1 million.\nUnallocated Corporate\nUnallocated corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $3.3 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due an increase in (i) payroll related\nexpenses of $1.6 million, (ii) professional and advisory fees of $1.0 million primarily related to the accounting restatement, and (iii) general overhead and administrative expenses of\n$0.7 million primarily related to insurance and software and maintenance expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense\n37\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, Change from Percent Change\n2023 2022 Prior Year from Prior Year\nIncome tax expense $ 11,390,953 $ 68,448 $ 11,322,505 16,541.8 %\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the effective tax rates were 695.1% and 9.8%, respectively. The fluctuation in the effective rate was primarily attributable to state\ntaxes, including the change in rates, stock-based compensation and changes in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Please see Note 9, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe table below reconciles net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNon-GAAP Financial Data:\nNet (loss) income $ (9,752,197) $ 626,705\nNet interest 67,461 133,101\nDepreciation and amortization expense 8,582,203 6,646,622\nIncome tax expense 11,390,953 68,448\nEBITDA 10,288,420 7,474,876\nStock compensation expense 1,737,682 1,273,989\nAcquisition related expenses 873,214 2,356,049\nNet loss on disposition or impairment 2,632,604 410,215\nCosts related to restatement filings 380,221 —\nRestructuring Costs 72,880 —\nOther income related to the ERC (3,779,304) —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 12,205,717 $ 11,515,129\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net (loss) income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related expenses (which includes contract termination costs\nassociated with reacquired regional developer rights), stock-based compensation expense, bargain purchase gain, (gain) loss on disposition or impairment, costs related to restatement\nfilings, restructuring costs, and other income related to the ERC. The costs related to restatement filings of $0.4 million were incurred as of September 30, 2023 but were not included\nin the Q3 2023 Form 10-Q as a cost excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. However, as these costs are non-recurring, we have\nidentified them as an adjustment to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We have provided Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of financial performance\nbecause it is commonly used for comparing companies in our industry. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for operating profit as an indicator of our operating\nperformance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from other companies.\nWe believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial\nmeasures with other outpatient medical clinics, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating Adjusted\nEBITDA, in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference\nthat our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures\ncomputed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOur management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of\nAdjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. Some of these limitations include the\nfollowing:\n•. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n•. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n•. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\n•. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA\ndoes not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n•. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration; and\n•. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the (gain) loss on disposition or impairment, which represents the impairment of assets as of the reporting date. We do not consider this to\nbe indicative of our ongoing operations.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We\ncompensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. You should review the reconciliation of net (loss)\nincome to Adjusted EBITDA above and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and short-term bank deposits of $18.2 million. We generated $14.7 million of cash flow from operating activities in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. While unfavorable global economic or political conditions create potential liquidity risks, as discussed further below, we believe that our existing cash and cash\nequivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and investment needs for at\nleast the next 12 months.\nWhile the interruptions, delays and/or cost increases resulting from political instability and geopolitical tensions, economic weakness, inflationary pressures, increase in interest rates\nand other factors have created uncertainty as to general economic conditions for 2024, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient\naccess to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of\nour business. For 2024, we expect to use or redeploy our cash resources to support our business within the context of prevailing market conditions, which, given the ongoing\nuncertainties described above, could rapidly and materially deteriorate or otherwise change. Our long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate\ninitiatives, could be dependent on our ability to access additional funds through the debt and/or equity markets. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of\neconomic weakness, political unrest or war, or any other reason, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner and on favorable\nterms, if at all, and if obtained, it may be more costly or more dilutive. From time to time, we consider and evaluate transactions related to our portfolio and capital structure,\nincluding debt financings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, and other transactions. Given the ongoing uncertainties described above, the levels of our cash flows from\noperations for 2024 may be impacted. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain the capital necessary to meet our short and long-term\ncapital requirements.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased net income, net of non-cash charges, in the year ended December 31, 2023 of $13.9 million versus\n$8.4 million in the prior year period and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 versus $(0.2) million in the prior year\nperiod. The increase in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31,\n39\nTable of Contents\n2023 is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in accrued expenses of $0.8 million, mainly driven by accruals relating to the restatement and ERC consultants, (ii) an increase in\npayroll liabilities of $1.5 million, mostly due to the short-term incentive compensation accrual in the current year (without the comparable accrual as of December 31, 2022) and\npayroll cycle timing, (iii) an increase in deferred franchise cost of $0.4 million related to the commissions paid for the sale of franchise licenses during the year and (iv) an increase in\ndeferred revenue of $0.3 million related to the amounts collected for the sale of franchise license and membership and wellness packages sold during the year (which are recorded as\ndeferred revenue until the service is performed). These increases in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the decreases in (i) upfront regional developer fees of $0.6\nmillion, (ii) accounts payable of $1.4 million due to the general increase in operating expenses and timing of payments, and (iii) prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.3\nmillion, mainly driven by the general increase in operating expenses.\nCash provided by operating activities is subject to variability period over period as a result of the timing of collections and payments related to accounts receivable, accrued expenses,\nand other operating assets and liabilities. Royalties and other fees are collected from our franchisees semi-monthly, two working days after each sales period has ended.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.2 million and $17.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nthis included clinic acquisitions for $1.2 million and purchases of property and equipment for $5.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this included clinic acquisitions for\n$12.1 million, purchases of property and equipment for $5.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 million and $0.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, this included proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this included proceeds from the exercise of stock options of\n$0.4 million.\nThe following table summarizes our material contractual obligations at December 31, 2023 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in\nfuture periods:\nMaterial Contractual Cash Requirements\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\nTotal 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nOperating leases $ 16,694,145 4,424,754 4,052,720 2,753,979 2,026,045 1,202,912 2,233,735\nDebt under the\nCredit Agreement $ 2,000,000 — — — 2,000,000 — —\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 1, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for\ninformation regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements that may impact our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special\npurpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFinancial instruments held by us as of December 31, 2023 include cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings. A portion of our cash is affected by short-term interest rates,\nwhich are currently low. Given the low interest income generated from our cash, any reduction in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest income.\n40\nTable of Contents\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, the Revolver exposes us to market risk for changes in\ninterest rates. Given our short-term debt position as of December 31, 2023, the effect of a 10-basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our variable\ninterest expense.\nITEM 8.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of\nincome, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated March 7, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue growth rate utilized in the determination of the fair value of reacquired franchise rights and customer relationships for certain acquisitions\nAs described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company repurchased certain operating franchised clinics for a net purchase consideration of approximately $1.2\nmillion in May 2023. The acquisitions were treated as an asset purchase. As a result of the acquisitions, management was required to determine the estimated fair values of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed, including certain identifiable intangible assets. Management utilized third-party valuation specialists to assist in the preparation of the valuation of\ncertain identifiable intangible assets. Management exercised judgment to develop and select revenue growth rates in the measurement of the fair values of the reacquired franchise\nrights and customer relationships.\nWe identified the revenue growth rates utilized in the determination of the fair values of the reacquired franchise rights and customer relationships for certain acquisitions as a critical\naudit matter. The principal considerations for our determination included the subjectivity and judgment required to determine the revenue growth rates used in the fair value\nmeasurement of reacquired franchise rights and customer relationships for certain acquisitions. Auditing these revenue growth rates involved especially subjective auditor judgment\ndue to the nature and extent of audit effort required.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates by i) comparing to the historical performance using the audited prior year revenue, (ii) assessing the revenue growth\nrates against industry metrics, and (iii) comparing the actual post-acquisition net revenue to the forecast revenue.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nPhoenix, Arizona\nMarch 7, 2024\n43\nTable of Contents\nTHE JOINT CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 18,153,609 $ 9,745,066\nRestricted cash 1,060,683 805,351\nAccounts receivable 3,718,924 3,911,272\nDeferred franchise and regional development costs, current portion 1,047,430 1,054,060\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 2,439,837 2,098,359\nAssets held for sale 17,915,055 —\nTotal current assets 44,335,538 17,614,108\nProperty and equipment, net 11,044,317 17,475,152\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 12,413,221 20,587,199\nDeferred franchise and regional development costs, net of current portion 5,203,936 5,707,678\nIntangible assets, net 5,020,926 10,928,295\nGoodwill 7,352,879 8,493,407\nDeferred tax assets ($1.1 million and $1.0 million attributable to VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022) 1,031,648 11,928,152\nDeposits and other assets 748,394 756,386\nTotal assets $ 87,150,859 $ 93,490,377\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 1,625,088 $ 2,966,589\nAccrued expenses 1,963,009 1,069,610\nCo-op funds liability 1,060,683 805,351\nPayroll liabilities ($0.7 million and $0.6 million attributable to VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022) 3,485,744 2,030,510\nOperating lease liability, current portion 3,756,328 5,295,830\nFinance lease liability, current portion 25,491 24,433\nDeferred franchise fee revenue, current portion 2,516,554 2,468,601\nDeferred revenue from company clinics ($1.6 million and $4.7 million attributable to VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022) 4,463,747 7,471,549\nUpfront regional developer fees, current portion 362,326 487,250\nOther current liabilities 483,249 597,294\nLiabilities to be disposed of ($3.6 million attributable to VIEs as of December 31, 2023) 13,831,863 —\nTotal current liabilities 33,574,082 23,217,017\nOperating lease liability, net of current portion 10,914,997 18,672,719\nFinance lease liability, net of current portion 38,016 63,507\nDebt under the Credit Agreement 2,000,000 2,000,000\nDeferred franchise fee revenue, net of current portion 13,597,325 14,161,134\nUpfront regional developer fees, net of current portion 1,019,316 1,500,278\nOther liabilities 1,235,241 1,287,879\nTotal liabilities 62,378,977 60,902,534\nCommitments and contingencies (note 10)\nStockholders' equity:\nSeries A preferred stock, $0.001 par value;

(“The Joint”), which includes its variable interest entities (“VIEs”), and its wholly\nowned subsidiary, The Joint Corporate Unit No. 1, LLC (collectively, the “Company”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses,\nother (expenses) income, and income taxes that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best\nknowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates. For a discussion of significant estimates and judgments made in recognizing revenue, accounting\nfor leases, and accounting for income taxes, see Note 2, \"Revenue Disclosures,\" Note 9, \"Income Taxes,\" and Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Joint and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Joint Corporate Unit No. 1, LLC, which was dormant for\nall periods presented. The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations\n(“ASC 810”). Non-controlling interests represent third-party equity ownership interests in VIEs. All significant inter-affiliate accounts and transactions between The Joint and its\nVIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.\nComprehensive (Loss) Income\nNet (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income are the same for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNature of Operations\nThe Joint Corp., a Delaware corporation, was formed on March 10, 2010 for the principal purpose of franchising, developing, selling regional developer rights, supporting the\noperations of franchised chiropractic clinics, and operating and managing corporate chiropractic clinics at locations throughout the United States of America. The franchising of\nchiropractic clinics is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and various state authorities.\nThe following table summarizes the number of clinics in operation under franchise agreements and as company-owned or managed for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\nFranchised clinics: 2023 2022\nClinics open at beginning of period 712 610\nOpened during the period 104 121\nAcquired during the period — 2\nSold during the period (3) (16)\nClosed during the period (13) (5)\nClinics in operation at the end of the period 800 712\n50\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\nCompany-owned or managed clinics: 2023 2022\nClinics open at beginning of period 126 96\nOpened during the period 10 16\nAcquired during the period 3 16\nSold during the period — (2)\nClosed during the period (4) —\nClinics in operation at the end of the period 135 126\nTotal clinics in operation at the end of the period 935 838\nClinic licenses sold but not yet developed 132 197\nExecuted letters of intent for future clinic licenses 40 38\nVariable Interest Entities\nCertain states prohibit the “corporate practice of chiropractic,” which restricts business corporations from practicing chiropractic care by exercising control over clinical decisions by\nchiropractic doctors. In states which prohibit the corporate practice of chiropractic, the Company typically enters into long-term management services agreements (\"MSAs\") with\nprofessional corporations (“PCs”) that are owned by licensed chiropractic doctors, which, in turn, employ or contract with doctors who provide professional chiropractic care in its\nclinics. Under these management agreements with PCs, the Company provides, on an exclusive basis, all non-clinical services of the chiropractic practice. The Company has entered\ninto such management agreements with three PCs, including one in Kansas, in connection with the opening of company-managed clinics in August 2022. An entity deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE in its financial statements. An entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both of the following\ncharacteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of\nthe VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, these PCs were determined to be VIEs. Such PCs are VIEs, as\nfees paid by the PCs to the Company as its management service provider are considered variable interests because the fees do not meet all the following criteria: 1) The fees are\ncompensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services; 2) The decision maker or service provider does not hold other\ninterests in the VIE that individually, or in the aggregate, would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the VIE’s expected losses or receive more than an insignificant amount\nof the VIE’s expected residual returns; 3) The service arrangement includes only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services\nnegotiated at arm’s length. Additionally, the Company has determined that it has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of these PCs and\nhave an obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits which could potentially be significant to the PCs. Accordingly, the PCs are VIEs for which the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary and are consolidated by the Company.\nThe revenues of VIEs represent the revenues of Company-managed clinics in states that prohibit the corporate practice of chiropractic. The Company's involvement with VIEs affects\nits financial performance and cash flows primarily through amounts recorded in Revenues from company-owned or managed clinics and General and administrative expenses, which\nare principally comprised of payroll and related expenses, merchant card fees and insurance expense. The management fees/income provided by the MSAs are considered\nintercompany transactions and therefore eliminated upon consolidation of VIEs.\nThe VIEs’ total revenue was $41.5 million and $34.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VIEs' general and administrative expenses,\nexcluding the consolidated intercompany management fee, were $18.4 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe VIEs’ deferred revenue liability balance for amounts collected in advance for membership and wellness packages was $1.6 million and $4.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The VIEs’ payroll liability balance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The VIEs'\ndeferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The VIEs' liabilities to be disposed of as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was $3.6 million. The carrying amount of the other VIEs’ assets and liabilities was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, except for those\npreviously listed.\n51\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company continually monitors its\npositions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. As of the balance sheet date and periodically throughout the period, the Company has maintained\nbalances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has invested substantially all its cash in short-term bank deposits. The Company had no\ncash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash relates to cash that franchisees and company-owned or managed clinics contribute to the Company’s National Marketing Fund and cash that franchisees provide to\nvarious voluntary regional Co-Op Marketing Funds. Cash contributed by franchisees to the National Marketing Fund is to be used in accordance with the Company’s Franchise\nDisclosure Document with a focus on regional and national marketing and advertising. While such cash balance is not legally segregated and restricted as to withdrawal or usage, the\nCompany's accounting policy is to classify these funds as restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from franchisees for royalty and software fees. The Company records an allowance for credit losses as a reduction to its\naccounts receivables for amounts that the Company does not expect to recover. An allowance for credit losses is determined through assessments of collectability based on historical\ntrends, the financial condition of the Company’s franchisees, including any known or anticipated bankruptcies, and an evaluation of current economic conditions, as well as the\nCompany’s expectations of conditions in the future. Actual losses ultimately could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had no allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable.\nDeferred Franchise Costs and Regional Development Costs\nDeferred franchise and regional development costs represent commissions that are direct and incremental to the Company and are paid in conjunction with the sale of a franchise\nlicense or regional development rights. These costs are recognized as an expense, in franchise and regional development cost of revenues when the respective revenue is recognized,\nwhich is generally over the term of the related franchise or regional developer agreement.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost or for property acquired as part of franchise acquisitions at fair value at the date of closing. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over estimated useful lives, which is generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or\nthe estimated useful life of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; major renewals and improvements are capitalized. When items of property or\nequipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.\nCapitalized Software\nThe Company capitalizes certain software development costs, including costs to implement cloud computing arrangements that is a service contract. These capitalized costs are\nprimarily related to software used by clinics for operations and by the Company for the management of operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are\nexpensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct, are capitalized as assets in progress until the software is\nsubstantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades\nand enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Internally developed software is recorded as part of property and equipment.\nMaintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to\nfive years. Implementation costs incurred in connection with a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract are included in prepaid expenses in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company leases property and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company leases its corporate office space and the space for each of the company-owned or\nmanaged clinic in the portfolio. The Company recognizes a right-of-use\n52\nTable of Contents\n(\"ROU\") asset and lease liability for all leases. Certain leases includeo ne or more renewal options, generally for the same period as the initial term of the lease. The exercise of lease\nrenewal options is generally at the Company’s sole discretion and, as such, the Company typically determines that exercise of these renewal options is not reasonably certain. As a\nresult, the Company does not include the renewal option period in the expected lease term and the associated lease payments are not included in the measurement of the ROU asset\nand lease liability. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for\nsubstantially all of its leases. In such cases, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate it would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments\nover a similar term, with similar collateral as in the lease, and in a similar economic environment. The Company estimates these rates using available evidence such as rates imposed\nby third-party lenders to the Company in recent financings or observable risk-free interest rate and credit spreads for commercial debt of a similar duration, with credit spreads\ncorrelating to the Company’s estimated creditworthiness.\nFor operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date it takes\npossession of the leased property. Pre-opening costs are recorded as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments, such as percentage rentals based on\nlocation sales, periodic adjustments for inflation, reimbursement of real estate taxes, any variable common area maintenance and any other variable costs associated with the leased\nproperty are expensed as incurred and are also included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated income statements.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of re-acquired franchise rights and customer relationships. The Company amortizes the fair value of re-acquired franchise rights over the\nremaining contractual terms of the re-acquired franchise rights at the time of the acquisition, which generally range from one to nine years. The fair value of customer relationships is\namortized over their estimated useful life of two to four years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of franchises. Goodwill and\nintangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and more frequently if a triggering event occurs that makes it more likely\nthan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below carrying value. As required, the Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth\nquarter or more frequently if a triggering event occurs. No impairments of goodwill were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. The\nCompany looks primarily to estimated undiscounted future cash flows in its assessment of whether or not long-lived assets are recoverable. The Company records an impairment loss\nwhen the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2023, certain long-lived asset groups classified as held and\nused were determined to not be recoverable. The carrying values of these asset groups included fixed assets of $3.0 million that were written down to $1.2 million. During the year\nended December 31, 2022, an operating lease ROU asset related to a closed clinic with a total carrying amount of approximately $0.2 million was written down to zero. As a result,\nthe Company recorded a noncash impairment loss of approximately $1.8 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn connection with the planned sale of certain company-owned and managed clinics, the Company reclassified $4.9 million of net property and equipment, $3.4 million of intangible\nassets, net, $1.1 million of goodwill and $9.2 million of ROU assets to Assets held for sale and reclassified $10.2 million of lease liability and $3.6 million of deferred revenue from\nCompany clinics to Liabilities to be disposed of in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Long-lived assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the\nlower of their carrying value or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $0.7 million to adjust the carrying value of the\ndisposal group to fair value less cost to sell during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the sale of two company-managed clinics to franchisees, the Company reclassified $288,192 of property and equipment and $359,807 of ROU assets to Assets\nheld for sale and reclassified $428,593 of ROU liability and $54,351 of deferred revenue from company clinics to Liabilities to be disposed of in the consolidated balance sheet as of\nJune 30, 2022. Long-lived assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less estimated\n53\nTable of Contents\ncosts to sell. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $79,400 to adjust the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. One of the two clinics was sold during August 2022, and the second clinic was sold in October 2022.\nAdvertising Fund\nThe Company has established an advertising fund for national or regional marketing and advertising of services offered by its clinics. The monthly marketing fee is2 % of clinic\nsales. The Company segregates the marketing funds collected which are included in restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheets. As amounts are expended from the fund, the\nCompany recognizes a related expense. Such costs are included in selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated income statements.\nCo-Op Marketing Funds\nSome franchises have established regional Co-Ops for advertising within their local and regional markets. The Company maintains a custodial relationship under which the Co-Op\nMarketing Funds collected are segregated and used for the purposes specified by the Co-Ops’ officers. The Co-Op Marketing Funds are included in restricted cash on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue primarily through its company-owned and managed clinics and through royalties, franchise fees, advertising fund contributions, IT related income\nand computer software fees from its franchisees.\nRevenues from Company-Owned or Managed Clinics. The Company earns revenues from clinics that it owns and operates or manages throughout the United States. Revenues are\nrecognized when services are performed. The Company offers a variety of membership and wellness packages which feature discounted pricing as compared with its single-visit\npricing. Amounts collected in advance for membership and wellness packages are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the service is performed. Any unused visits\nassociated with monthly memberships are recognized on a month-to-month basis. The Company recognizes a contract liability (or a deferred revenue liability) related to the prepaid\ntreatment plans for which the Company has an ongoing performance obligation. The Company derecognizes this contract liability, and recognizes revenue, as the patient consumes\nhis or her visits related to the package and the Company transfers its services. If the Company determines that it is not subject to unclaimed property laws for the portion of wellness\npackage that it does not expect to be redeemed (referred to as “breakage”) then it recognizes breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights by the patient.\nRoyalties and Advertising Fund Revenue. The Company collects royalties, as stipulated in the franchise agreement, equal to 7% of gross sales, and a marketing and advertising fee\ncurrently equal to 2% of gross sales. Royalties, including franchisee contributions to advertising funds, are calculated as a percentage of clinic sales over the term of the franchise\nagreement. The revenue accounting standard provides an exception for the recognition of sales-based royalties promised in exchange for a license (which generally requires a\nreporting entity to estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in the transaction price). As the franchise agreement royalties, inclusive of advertising\nfund contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to the Company’s performance obligation under the franchise agreement, such sales-based royalties are\nrecognized as franchisee clinic level sales occur. Royalties are collected semi-monthly, two working days after each sales period has ended.\nFranchise Fees. The Company requires the entire non-refundable initial franchise fee to be paid upon execution of a franchise agreement, which typically has an initial term of1 0\nyears. Initial franchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. The Company’s services under the franchise agreement include\ntraining of franchisees and staff, site selection, construction/vendor management and ongoing operations support. The Company provides no financing to franchisees and offers no\nguarantees on their behalf. The services provided by the Company are highly interrelated with the franchise license and as such are considered to represent a single performance\nobligation. Renewal franchise fees, as well as transfer fees, are also recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement.\nSoftware Fees. The Company collects a monthly fee from its franchisees for use of its proprietary chiropractic software, computer support and internet services support. These fees\nare recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement.\nCapitalized Sales Commissions. Sales commissions earned by the regional developers and the Company’s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a\nfranchise agreement with a franchisee. These costs are deferred and\n54\nTable of Contents\nthen amortized as the respective franchise fees are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement.\nUpfront Regional Developer Rights Fees\nThe Company has a regional developer program where regional developers are granted an exclusive geographical territory and commit to a minimum development obligation within\nthat defined territory. Upon granting of the exclusive rights to develop a territory, a regional developer will pay an upfront fee to the Company. Upfront regional developer fees\nrepresent consideration received from a vendor to act as the Company’s agent within an exclusive territory. The upfront regional developer rights fee is accounted for as a reduction of\ncost of revenues, in franchise and regional development cost of revenues, to offset the respective future commissions paid to the regional developer. The fees are ratably recognized\nover the term of the related regional developer agreement.\nRegional developers receive fees which are funded by the initial franchise fees collected from franchisees upon the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical territory and\na royalty of 3% of sales generated by franchised clinics in their exclusive geographical territory. Initial fees related to the sale of franchises within their exclusive geographical\nterritory are initially deferred as deferred franchise costs and are recognized as an expense in franchise cost of revenues when the respective revenue is recognized, which is generally\nover the term of the related franchise agreement. Royalties of 3% of sales generated by franchised clinics in their regions are also recognized as franchise cost of revenues as\nfranchisee clinic level sales occur. This 3% fee is funded by the 7% royalties we collect from the franchisees in their regions. Certain regional developer agreements result in the\nregional developer acquiring the rights to existing royalty streams from clinics already open in the respective territory. In those instances, fees collected from the sale of the royalty\nstream is recognized as a decrease to franchise and regional developer cost of revenues over the remaining life of the respective franchise agreements.\nRegional Developer Rights Contract Termination Costs\nFrom time to time, subject to the Company’s strategy, regional developer rights are reacquired by the Company, resulting in a termination of the contract. The termination costs to\nreacquire the regional developer rights are recognized at fair value, less any unrecognized upfront regional developer fee liability balance, as a general and administrative expense in\nthe period in which the contract is terminated in accordance with the contract terms and are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are advertising and marketing expenses incurred by the Company, primarily through advertising funds. The Company expenses production costs of commercial\nadvertising upon first airing and expenses the costs of communicating the advertising in the period in which the advertising occurs. Advertising expenses were $6.8 million and $5.2\nmillion, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach known as the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying\nthe statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the consolidated balance sheets to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities represent the future tax consequence for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The differences\nrelate principally to depreciation of property and equipment and treatment of revenue for franchise fees and regional developer fees collected. Tax positions are reviewed at least\nquarterly and adjusted as new information becomes available. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from\nall sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income\ninherently require significant judgment. To the extent it is considered more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be not recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the tax benefit or expense from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position\nwill be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits and expenses recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company\nhas identified $1.2 million and $1.3 million in uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest and penalties associated with tax positions are\nrecorded in the period assessed as general and administrative expenses.\nWith exceptions due to the generation and utilization of net operating losses or credits, as of December 31, 2023, the Company is no longer subject to federal and state examinations\nby taxing authorities for tax years before 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n55\nTable of Contents\n(Loss) Earnings per Common Share\nBasic (loss) earnings per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted (loss)\nearnings per common share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares including restricted stock and stock options.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet (loss) income $ (9,752,197) $ 626,705\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 14,688,115 14,488,314\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nUnvested restricted stock and stock options 247,102 379,779\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 14,935,217 14,868,093\nBasic (loss) earnings per share $ (0.66) $ 0.04\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share $ (0.65) $ 0.04\nPotentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per common share as the effect would be anti-dilutive were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nUnvested restricted stock — —\nStock options 89,152 89,152\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments by recognizing compensation expense based upon the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The Company\ndetermines the estimated grant-date fair value of restricted shares using the closing price on the date of the grant and the grant-date fair value of stock options using the Black-\nScholes-Merton model. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding the components of the model, including risk-free interest rate,\nvolatility, expected dividend yield and expected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation. The Company recognizes compensation\ncosts ratably over the period of service using the straight-line method. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical and forecasted turnover, which is approximately 5%.\nRetirement Benefit Plan\nEmployees of the Company are eligible to participate in a defined contribution retirement plan, the Joint Corp. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), under Section 401(k) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees may contribute their eligible compensation, not to exceed the annual limits set by the IRS. The 401(k) Plan allows the\nCompany to match participants’ contributions in an amount determined at the sole discretion of the Company. The Company matched participants’ contributions for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, up to a maximum of 4% of the employee’s eligible compensation. Employer contributions totaled $570,877 and $478,277, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. The Company records an accrual for a potential\nloss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a range of amounts,\nthe minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an\naccrual is not required, the Company provides additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of\nsuch litigation and other claims include\n56\nTable of Contents\npotential material adverse impacts on the Company. Legal costs to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as such costs are incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to significant estimates and assumptions include loss\ncontingencies, share-based compensations, useful lives and realizability of long-lived assets, deferred revenue and revenue recognition related to breakage, deferred franchise costs,\ncalculation of ROU assets and liabilities related to leases, realizability of deferred tax assets, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, and purchase price\nallocations and related valuations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities to provide greater disaggregation within their annual rate reconciliation, including new requirements to present reconciling\nitems on a gross basis in specified categories, disclose both percentages and dollar amounts, and disaggregate individual reconciling items by jurisdiction and nature when the effect\nof the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires disaggregating the annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, by federal (national), state,\nand foreign taxes, with separate presentation of individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities with a single\nreportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by this standard and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 on an interim and annual basis, including new\nrequirements to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure(s) of a\nsegment's profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment's\nprofit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and disclosures.\nNote 2: Revenue Disclosures\nCompany-Owned or Managed Clinics\nThe Company earns revenues from clinics that it owns and operates or manages throughout the United States. Revenues are recognized when services are performed. The Company\noffers a variety of membership and wellness packages which feature discounted pricing as compared with its single-visit pricing. Amounts collected in advance for membership and\nwellness packages are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the service is performed in accordance with the Company’s breakage policy, as discussed in Note 1,\"\nRevenue Recognition.\"\nFranchising Fees, Royalty Fees, Advertising Fund Revenue, and Software Fees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 800 franchised clinics in operation, 132 clinic licenses sold but not yet developed and 40 executed letters of intent for future clinic licenses. The\nfranchise arrangement is documented in the form of a franchise agreement. The franchise arrangement requires the Company to perform various activities to support the brand that do\nnot directly transfer goods and services to the franchisee, but instead represent a single performance obligation, which is the transfer of the franchise license. The intellectual property\nsubject to the franchise license is symbolic intellectual property as it does not have significant standalone functionality, and substantially all of the utility is derived from its\nassociation with the Company’s past or ongoing activities. The nature of the Company’s promise in granting the franchise license is to provide the franchisee with access to the\nbrand’s symbolic intellectual property over the term of the license. The services provided by the Company are highly interrelated with the franchise license and as such are considered\nto represent a single performance obligation.\nThe transaction price in a standard franchise arrangement primarily consists of (a) initial franchise fees, (b) continuing franchise fees (royalties), (c) advertising fees, and (d) software\nfees. Generally, the revenue accounting standard requires the reporting\n57\nTable of Contents\nentity to estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in the transaction price. However, the revenue accounting standard provides an exception, and it\nallows a reporting entity to recognize revenue for a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property only when (or as) the later of the\nfollowing events occurs: (i) the subsequent sale or usage occurs, or (ii) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated\nhas been satisfied (or partially satisfied). In accordance with the revenue accounting standard exception, royalty and advertising revenue are recognized when the franchisee's sales\noccur.\nThe Company recognizes the primary components of the transaction price as follows:\n• Initial and renewal franchise fees, as well as transfer fees, are recognized as revenue ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement\ncommencing with the execution of the franchise, renewal, or transfer agreement. As these fees are typically received in cash at or near the beginning of the contract term, the\ncash received is initially recorded as a contract liability until recognized as revenue over time.\n• The Company is entitled to royalties and advertising fees based on a percentage of the franchisee's gross sales as defined in the franchise agreement. Royalty and advertising\nrevenue are recognized when the franchisee's sales occur. Depending on timing within a fiscal period, the recognition of revenue results in either what is considered a contract\nasset (unbilled receivable) or, once billed, accounts receivable, on the consolidated balance sheet.\n• The Company is entitled to a software fee, which is charged monthly. The Company recognizes revenue related to software fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of\nthe franchise agreement.\nIn determining the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers, the Company exercises significant judgment with respect to collectability of the amount; however,\nthe timing of recognition does not require significant judgment as it is based on either the franchise term or the reported sales of the franchisee, neither of which requires estimation.\nThe Company believes its franchising arrangements do not contain a significant financing component.\nThe Company recognizes advertising fees received under franchise agreements as advertising fund revenue.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company believes that the captions contained on the consolidated income statements appropriately reflect the disaggregation of its revenue by major type for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. Other revenues primarily consist of merchant income associated with preferred vendor royalties associated with franchisees' credit card transactions.\nThe following table shows the Company's revenues disaggregated according to the timing of transfer of services:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue recognized at a point in time $ 109,726,899 $ 94,520,246\nRevenue recognized over time $ 7,969,457 $ 6,732,064\nTotal Revenue $ 117,696,356 $ 101,252,310\nRollforward of Contract Liabilities and Contract Costs\nChanges in the Company's contract liability for deferred revenue from company clinics during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n58\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Revenue\nfrom company clinics\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 5,235,745\nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year (4,553,086)\nNet increase during the year ended December 31, 2022 6,788,890\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 7,471,549\nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year (6,455,934)\nNet increase during the year ended December 31, 2023 3,448,132\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 4,463,747\nChanges in the Company's contract liability for deferred franchise fees during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nDeferred Revenue\nshort and long-term\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 15,375,151\nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year (2,250,471)\nNet increase during the year ended December 31, 2022 3,505,055\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 16,629,735\nRevenue recognized that was included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year (2,709,080)\nNet increase during the year ended December 31, 2023 2,193,224\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 16,113,879\nThe Company's deferred franchise and development costs represent capitalized sales commissions.

As of the acquisition date, the Company operates the franchises as company-managed clinics. The total purchase price for the\ntransaction was $1,188,764 to the seller less $28,997 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total purchase consideration of $1,159,767.\nBased on the terms of the purchase agreement, the 2023 CA Clinics Purchase has been treated as an asset purchase under GAAP as there were no outputs or processes to generate\noutputs acquired as part of these transactions. Under an asset purchase, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity. Cost is allocated to the individual assets\nacquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill.\nThe allocation of the total purchase price of the 2023 CA Clinics Purchase was as follows:\nProperty and equipment $ 313,995\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 317,662\nIntangible assets 1,004,513\nTotal assets acquired 1,636,170\nDeferred revenue (158,365)\nOperating lease liability - current portion (118,081)\nOperating lease liability - net of current portion (199,957)\nNet purchase consideration $ 1,159,767\nIntangible assets in the table above primarily consist of reacquired franchise rights of $0.7 million amortized over their estimated useful lives of six to seven years, customer\nrelationships of $0.1 million amortized over an estimated useful life of two years and assembled workforce of $0.2 million amortized over an estimated useful life of two years.\n2022 Acquisitions\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreement under which the Company repurchased from the seller four operating franchises in Arizona.\nThe Company operates the franchises as company-owned clinics. The total purchase price for the transaction was $5,761,256, less $70,484 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total\npurchase consideration of $5,690,772.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreement under which the Company repurchased from the seller one operating franchise in Arizona\n(collectively, including the May 19th purchase, the “AZ Clinics Purchase”). The Company operates the franchise as a company-owned clinic. The total purchase price for the\ntransaction was $1,205,667, less $13,241 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total purchase consideration of $1,192,426.\nBased on the terms of the purchase agreements, the AZ Clinics Purchase has been treated as a business combination under GAAP using the acquisition method of accounting, which\nrequires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at\n60\nTable of Contents\nthe date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe allocation of the total purchase price of AZ Clinics Purchase was as follows:\nProperty and equipment $ 241,511\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 912,937\nIntangible assets 3,689,100\nTotal assets acquired 4,843,548\nGoodwill 3,408,205\nDeferred revenue (455,317)\nOperating lease liability - current portion (128,516)\nOperating lease liability - net of current portion (784,722)\nNet purchase consideration $ 6,883,198\nIntangible assets in the table above consist of re-acquired franchise rights of $2,892,100, amortized over estimated useful lives of approximately four to eight years and customer\nrelationships of $797,000, amortized over estimated useful lives of two to three years. The fair value of re-acquired franchise rights are estimated using the multi-period excess\nearnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that\ncan be attributed to supporting assets, such as assembled workforce and working capital that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. The resulting cash flow, which is\nattributable solely to the primary asset acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. Customer relationships are\nalso calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method.\nThe valuation method involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily related to forecasted revenue growth rates, gross margin, contributory asset charges,\ncustomer attrition rates, and market-participant discount rates. These measures are based on significant Level 3 inputs not observable in the market. Key assumptions developed\nbased on the Company’s historical experience, future projections and comparable market data include future cash flows, long-term growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangible assets. The factors that contributed to the\nrecognition of goodwill included synergies and benefits expected to be gained from leveraging the Company’s existing operations and infrastructures, as well as the expected\nassociated revenue and cash flow projections. Goodwill has been allocated to the Company’s Corporate Clinics segment based on such expected benefits. Goodwill related to the\nacquisition is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes over 15 years. The Company completed the purchase price allocation during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nOn July 29, 2022, the Company entered into Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreements under which the Company repurchased from the sellers three operating franchises in North\nCarolina. The Company operates the franchises as company-managed clinics. The total purchase price for the transactions was $1,317,312, less $31,647 of net deferred revenue,\nresulting in total purchase consideration of $1,285,665.\nOn October 13, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreement under which the Company repurchased from the seller an operating franchise in North\nCarolina. The Company operates the franchise as a company-managed clinic. The total purchase price for the transaction was $761,384, less $5,108 of net deferred revenue, resulting\nin total purchase consideration of $756,276.\nOn October 24, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreement under which the Company repurchased from the seller an operating franchise in North\nCarolina (collectively, including the July 29th and October 13th purchases, the \"NC Clinics Purchase\"). The Company operates the franchise as a company-managed clinic. The total\npurchase price for the transaction was $1,391,112, less $9,262 of net deferred revenue, resulting in total purchase consideration of $1,381,850.\nOn December 23, 2022, the Company entered into Asset and Franchise Purchase Agreements under which the Company repurchased from the sellers six operating franchises and one\nundeveloped clinic in California (the “2022 CA Clinics\n61\nTable of Contents\nPurchase”). The Company operates the franchises as company-managed clinics. The total purchase price for the transactions was $1,965,755, less $70,628 of net deferred revenue,\nresulting in total purchase consideration of $1,895,127.\nBased on the terms of the purchase agreement, the NC and 2022 CA Clinics Purchases have been treated as asset purchases under GAAP as there were no outputs or processes to\ngenerate outputs acquired as part of these transactions. Under an asset purchase, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity. Cost is allocated to the individual\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill.\nThe allocation of the total purchase price of NC Clinics Purchase was as follows:\nProperty and equipment $ 198,236\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 521,222\nIntangible assets 3,544,456\nTotal assets acquired 4,263,914\nDeferred revenue (326,332)\nOperating lease liability - current portion (146,255)\nOperating lease liability - net of current portion (367,536)\nNet purchase consideration $ 3,423,791\nIntangible assets in the table above consist of reacquired franchise rights of $2,042,658 amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to nine years, customer relationships of\n$909,828 amortized over an estimated useful life of two to three years, and assembled workforce of $591,970 amortized over an estimated useful life of two years.\nThe allocation of the total purchase price of 2022 CA Clinics Purchase was as follows:\nProperty and equipment $ 677,518\nTenant improvement allowance 55,790\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 1,520,353\nIntangible assets 1,480,359\nTotal assets acquired 3,734,020\nDeferred revenue (215,555)\nOperating lease liability - current portion (200,877)\nOperating lease liability - net of current portion (1,422,461)\nNet purchase consideration $ 1,895,127\nIntangible assets in the table above primarily consist of reacquired franchise rights of $1,151,272 amortized over their estimated useful lives of six to seven years, customer\nrelationships of $20,531 amortized over an estimated useful life of two years, and assembled workforce of $308,556 amortized over an estimated useful life of two years.\nAssets Held for Sale\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into negotiations to sell one of its company-managed clinics in California to a franchisee for a total of $0.1 million. The Company executed an\nLOI with the buyer in October 2023 and the sale closed February 2024. This transaction did not represent a major strategic shift for the Company, and, therefore, it does not meet the\ncriteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. As a result, the results of this clinic are reported in the Company’s operating results and in its Corporate Clinics segment until the\nsale finalized in February 2024. Effective with the designation as held for sale in June 2023, the Company discontinued recording depreciation on property and equipment, net and\namortization of ROU assets for the clinic as required by GAAP. The Company also separately classified the related assets and liabilities of the clinics as held for sale in its\nDecember 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring Q3 2023, the Company committed to a plan to sell specific corporate owned or managed clinics making up under1 0% of the corporate clinic portfolio with an estimated fair\nvalue of $1.6 million. The clinics are in varying stages of sales negotiations with all of them expected to close within one year. The clinics identified to commit to sell during Q3 2023\ndid not\n62\nTable of Contents\nrepresent a major strategic shift and therefore, they do not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. As a result, the results of these clinics will continue to be\nreported in the Company’s operating results and in its Corporate Clinics segment until the sales are each finalized. Effective with the designation as held for sale in September 2023,\nthe Company discontinued recording depreciation on property and equipment, net, amortization of intangible assets, net and amortization of ROU assets for the clinics as required by\nGAAP. The Company also separately classified the related assets and liabilities of the clinics as held for sale in its December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.\nIn November 2023, the Company initiated a plan to re-franchise the majority of its corporate-owned or managed clinics with plans to retain a small portion of high-performing\nclinics. The clinics identified in the plan to re-franchise make up approximately 67% (excluding the clinics previously committed to sell during Q3 2023) of the corporate owned or\nmanaged clinic portfolio. The clinics are in varying stages of sales negotiations with 42 of them expected to close within one year with an estimated fair value of $29.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The clinics identified to commit to sell and expected to close within one year did not represent a major strategic shift because the clinics identified to commit to\nsell and expected to close within one year do not involve exiting a major line of business or exiting a major geographic area. As a result, the results of these clinics will continue to be\nreported in the Company’s operating results and in its Corporate Clinics segment until the sales are each finalized. Effective with the designation as held for sale in November 2023,\nthe Company discontinued recording depreciation on property and equipment, net, amortization of intangible assets, net and amortization of ROU assets for the clinics as required by\nGAAP. The Company also separately classified the related assets and liabilities of the clinics as held for sale in its December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.\nLong-lived assets that meet the criteria for the held for sale designation are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated cost to sell. As a result of its\nevaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale relative to the agreed upon sales prices or the clinics estimated fair values, the Company\nrecorded an estimated loss on disposal of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as Net loss on disposition or impairment in its consolidated income statement and a\nvaluation allowance included in assets held for sale on its consolidated balance sheet.\nThe principal components of the held for sale assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nProperty and equipment, net $ 4,887,220\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 9,193,496\nIntangible assets, net 3,351,430\nGoodwill 1,140,529\nValuation allowance (657,620)\nTotal assets held for sale $ 17,915,055\nLiabilities\nOperating lease liability, current and non-current $ 10,209,382\nDeferred revenue from company clinics 3,622,481\nTotal liabilities to be disposed of $ 13,831,863\nThe pre-tax income of the clinics designated as held for sale is $4.4 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the results of which\nexclude the allocation of overhead.\nNote 4: Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following:\n63\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOffice and computer equipment $ 4,169,576 $ 5,207,833\nLeasehold improvements 12,013,250 17,842,901\nInternally developed software 5,399,698 5,843,758\nFinance lease assets 151,396 151,396\n21,733,920 29,045,888\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (12,005,459) (12,675,085)\n9,728,461 16,370,803\nConstruction in progress 1,315,856 1,104,349\nProperty and Equipment, net $ 11,044,317 $ 17,475,152\nDepreciation expense was $5,117,723 and $4,092,669 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to finance lease assets was $30,279 and $55,572 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nConstruction in progress at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 principally related to development and construction costs for the Company-owned or managed clinics.\nNote 5: Fair Value Consideration\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt under the Credit Agreement. The carrying\namounts of its financial instruments, excluding the debt under the Credit Agreement, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s\ndebt under the Credit Agreement approximates fair value due to its interest rate being calculated from observable quoted prices for similar instruments, which is considered a Level 2\nfair value measurement.\nAuthoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an\nexit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes\nthe use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs\nthat reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis as Level 1, 2 or 3.\nThe Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment,\nand operating lease ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their carrying amount. However, on a periodic basis\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill), non-financial assets are assessed\nfor impairment. If the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the asset to its fair value, which is considered\nLevel 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe assets and liabilities resulting from the Acquisitions (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Assets Held for Sale) were recorded at fair values on a nonrecurring basis at the date of\nacquisition and are considered Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\n64\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, intangible assets related to a clinic planned for closure with a total carrying amount of approximately $0.1 million was written down to\nzero. The remaining life of the intangible assets related to the clinic extended through December 2025. However, the clinic closed at the end of its lease term in November 2023. The\nCompany considered the intangible assets fully impaired at that time as the ability to obtain economic benefits in the period the clinic remained open was unlikely. As a result, the\nCompany recorded a noncash impairment loss of approximately $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as Net loss on disposition or impairment in its consolidated\nincome statement.\nIn connection with the planned sale of certain company-owned and managed clinics, the Company reclassified $4.9 million of net property and equipment, $3.4 million of intangible\nassets, net, $1.1 million of goodwill and $9.2 million of ROU assets to Assets held for sale and reclassified $10.2 million of lease liability and $3.6 million of deferred revenue from\nCompany clinics to Liabilities to be disposed of in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Long-lived assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the\nlower of their carrying value or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The estimated fair value of the company-owned or managed clinics classified as Held for Sale (see Note 3,\nAcquisitions and Assets Held for Sale) were recorded at fair values on a nonrecurring basis and are based upon Level 2 inputs, which includes a potential buyer agreed upon selling\nprice or Level 3 inputs, which include historical and future expected financial performance of the clinic and historical acquisition trends based on previous reacquired franchise clinic\npurchases. The fair value measurement of the assets held for sale was recorded as $0.2 million based upon Level 2 inputs and $30.4 million based upon Level 3 inputs. As a result,\nthe Company recorded a valuation allowance of $0.7 million to adjust the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the planned sale or determined closure of certain company-owned and managed clinics, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.7 million included in the\nnet loss, disposition and impairment on the consolidated income statement for impairment of long-lived assets classified as held and used where the asset group was not determined to\nbe recoverable. The asset group was determined to be the clinic level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other\ngroups of assets and liabilities. The long lived assets fair values were determined by the following: Level 2 inputs where available, which included using a valuation multiple (e.g,\nprice per square foot) based on observable prices for comparable long lived assets; and Level 3 inputs, which included the multiple earnings approach using the Company's historical\nearnings trend data, comparable historical asset sales by the Company and franchisees that were not exact matches, and (for calculating the fair value of intangible assets specifically)\nthe Company’s historical experience, future projections and comparable market data include future cash flows, long-term growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates. The carrying\nvalues of these asset groups impaired to their fair value included fixed assets of $2.9 million that were written down to $1.2 million determined by the Level 3 inputs discussed above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, an operating lease ROU assets related to a closed clinic with a total carrying amount of 0$.2 million was written down to zero. The\nassociated operating lease liability had a life of 39 months at the time of impairment. However, the ROU asset was fully impaired due to the abandonment of the lease in 2022. The\nCompany considers the ROU asset as abandoned as it lacks the ability to sublease the underlying asset and obtain economic benefits. As a result, the Company recorded a noncash\nimpairment loss of approximately $0.2 million as Net loss on disposition or impairment in its consolidated income statement during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNote 6: Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nDuring 2023, the Company recognized $0.7 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million of reacquired franchise rights, customer relationships, and assembled workforce, respectively,\nfrom the acquisitions as disclosed in Note 3, \"Acquisitions.\" Intangible assets consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nAmount Amortization Value\nIntangible assets subject to amortization:\nReacquired franchise rights $ 7,385,830 $ 2,926,595 $ 4,459,235\nCustomer relationships 1,682,807 1,349,938 332,869\nAssembled workforce 440,844 212,022 228,822\n$ 9,509,481 $ 4,488,555 $ 5,020,926\n65\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nAmount Amortization Value\nIntangible assets subject to amortization:\nReacquired franchise rights $ 12,881,894 $ 4,755,286 $ 8,126,608\nCustomer relationships 4,330,365 2,352,500 1,977,865\nAssembled workforce 959,837 136,015 823,822\n$ 18,172,096 $ 7,243,801 $ 10,928,295\nThe following is the weighted average amortization period for the Company's intangible assets:\nAmortization (Years)\nReacquired franchise rights 5.9\nCustomer relationships 2.6\nAssembled workforce 2.0\nAll intangible assets 4.9\nAmortization expense related to the Company’s intangible assets was $3,434,201 and 2,498,390 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEstimated amortization expense for 2024 and subsequent years is as follows:\n2024 $ 1,500,619\n2025 1,100,700\n2026 958,290\n2027 565,521\n2028 454,120\nThereafter 441,676\nTotal $ 5,020,926\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:\nCorporate Clinic Segment\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nGoodwill, gross 8,548,401\nAccumulated impairment losses (54,994)\nGoodwill, net 8,493,407\n2023 acquisition —\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nGoodwill, gross 8,548,401\nAccumulated impairment losses (54,994)\nGoodwill reclassified to Held for sale (1,140,529)\nGoodwill, net 7,352,879\nNote 7: Debt\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., individually, and as Administrative Agent and\nIssuing Bank (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Lender”). The Credit Agreement\n66\nTable of Contents\nprovided for senior secured credit facilities (the \"Credit Facilities\") in the amount of $7,500,000, including a $2,000,000 revolver (the \"Revolver\") and $5,500,000 development line\nof credit (the \"Line of Credit\").

All\noutstanding principal and interest on the Revolver were due on February 28, 2022.\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Facilities (as amended, the “2022 Credit Facility”) with the Lender. Under the 2022 Credit Facility, the\nRevolver increased to $20,000,000 (from $2,000,000), the portion of the Revolver available for letters of credit increased to $5,000,000 (from $1,000,000), the uncommitted\nadditional amount increased to $30,000,000 (from $2,500,000) and the developmental line of credit of $5,500,000 was terminated. The Revolver will be used for working capital\nneeds, general corporate purposes and for acquisitions, development and capital improvement uses. At the option of the Company, borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility bear\ninterest at: (i) the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), which is the daily simple SOFR, plus 0.10%, plus 1.75%, payable on the last day of the selected interest\nperiod of one, three or six months, and on the three-month anniversary of the beginning of any six-month interest period, if applicable; or (ii) an Alternative Base Rate (ABR), plus\n1.00%, payable monthly. The ABR is the greatest of: (A) the prime rate (as published by the Wall Street Journal), (B) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate, plus 0.5%, and\n(C) the adjusted one-month term SOFR rate. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver on February 28, 2022 continued to bear interest at the rate selected under the Credit Facilities\nprior to the amendment until the last day of the interest period in effect, at which time, if not repaid, the amounts outstanding under the Revolver will bear interest at the 2022 Credit\nFacility rate. As a result of this refinance, $2,000,000 of current maturity of long-term debt has been reclassified to long-term as of December 31, 2022. The 2022 Credit Facility will\nterminate and all principal and interest will become due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the amendment (February 28, 2027). On January 17, 2024, the Company paid down\nthe outstanding balance on its Debt under the Credit Agreement of $2,000,000. As a result of this pay down, $2,000,000 of the long-term debt has been reclassified as current as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of\nrepresentations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; and certain\nfundamental changes such as a merger or sale of substantially all assets (as further defined in the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with\ncustomary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants\nwould result in a default under the Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with\naccrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets, including the assets in the Company’s\ncompany-owned or managed clinics. The Company intends to use the Revolver for general working capital needs. The interest rate on funds borrowed under the Revolver as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was 7.2%. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, and\n$2,000,000 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Credit Facilities and the 2022 Credit Facility, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $52,648 and $76,415, respectively. Interest expense\nand amortization expense related to debt issuance costs are being amortized to “Other expense, net” and was $207,555 and $129,118 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nNote 8: Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based awards under its 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The shares issued as a result of stock-based compensation transactions generally\nhave been funded with the issuance of new shares of the Company’s common stock.\nThe Company may grant the following types of incentive awards under the 2014 Plan: (i) non-qualified stock options; (ii) incentive stock options; (iii) stock appreciation rights; (iv)\nrestricted stock; and (v) restricted stock units. Each award granted under the 2014 Plan is subject to an award agreement that incorporates, as applicable, the exercise price, the term of\nthe award, the periods of restriction, the number of shares to which the award pertains, and such other terms and conditions as the plan committee determines. Awards granted under\nthe 2014 Plan are classified as equity awards, which are recorded in stockholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Through December 31, 2023, the Company\nhas granted under the 2014 Plan (i) non-qualified stock options; (ii) incentive stock options; and (iii) restricted stock. There were no stock appreciation rights and restricted stock\nunits granted under the 2014 Plan as of December 31, 2023.\nStock Options\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s closing price on the date of grant is the basis of fair value of its common stock used in determining the value of share-based awards. To the extent the value of the\nCompany’s share-based awards involves a measure of volatility, the Company uses available historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a period of time\ncorresponding to the expected stock option term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as the Company does\nnot have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. Accordingly, the expected\nlife of the options granted is based on the average of the vesting term, which is generally four years and the contractual term, which is generally ten years. The Company will\ncontinue to evaluate the appropriateness of utilizing such method. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant for periods\ncorresponding to the expected stock option term. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical and forecasted turnover, which is approximately 5%.\nThe Company did not grant options during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe information below summarizes the stock options activity:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nNumber of Exercise Remaining Aggregate Intrinsic\nShares Price Contractual Life Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 595,089 $ 9.72 5.9 $ 33,336,794\nGranted at market price —\nExercised (43,380) 8.86 $ 657,058\nExpired (2,795) 28.45\nCancelled (16,991) 24.96\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 531,923 $ 9.2 4.7 $ 3,797,904\nGranted at market price —\nExercised (25,623) 7.90 $ 205,191\nExpired (12,591) 13.07\nCancelled (7,375) 28.58\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 486,334 $ 8.88 3.7 $ 1,903,699\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 453,465 $ 7.34 3.5 $ 1,903,699\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 485,643 $ 8.83 3.7 $ 1,903,699\nThe aggregate fair value of the Company’s stock options vested during 2023 and 2022 was $407,166 and $631,512, respectively.\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs ratably over the period of service using the straight-line method.

As of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regard to future\nrealization of deferred tax assets in each reporting jurisdiction. A significant piece of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the\nthree-year period ended December 31, 2023. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth, in evaluating the\nneed for a valuation allowance. As a result, management has determined that it is more likely than not that The Joint Corp. will not realize its deferred tax assets as of December 31,\n2023, and has recorded a valuation allowance after consideration of any recorded deferred tax liabilities\nThe Joint Corp, without the VIE, has federal gross net operating loss carryforwards of $13.4 million and $21.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Federal tax\neffected of these net operating losses were $2.8 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. $8.3 million of the federal net operating loss is subject to a\n20-year carryforward, with a portion beginning to expire in 2036. $5.1 million of the federal net operating loss has an indefinite carryforward period.\nThe Joint Corp., without its consolidated VIEs, has various state net operating loss carryforwards. The determination of the state net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon\napportionment percentages and state laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. If such net operating loss carryforwards are not utilized,\nthey will begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Joint Corp. has research and development credits of $14,229 that will begin to expire in 2031 and $21,621 California AMT credits that do not expire.\nThe VIE's have net operating loss carryforwards of $0.2 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No federal net operating loss is subject to a 20 year\ncarryforward. $0.2 million of the federal net operating loss has an indefinite carryforward period.\nThe VIE's have various state net operating loss carryforwards. The determination of the state net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon apportionment percentages and state\nlaws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. If such net operating loss carryforwards are not utilized, they will begin to expire in 2036.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate applied to pre-tax accounting net income, compared to the income tax benefit in the consolidated income\nstatements:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\nExpected federal tax expense $ 344,139 21.0 % $ 145,982 21.0 %\nMeals and entertainment 31,057 1.9 % — — %\nState tax provision (benefit), net of federal benefit 163,657 10.0 % 41,660 6.0 %\nOther permanent differences 12,651 0.8 % 15,458 2.2 %\nChange in VA 10,849,714 662.1 % — — %\nStock compensation (2,030) (0.1)% (91,454) (13.2)%\nChange in tax rate 147,911 9.0 % (64,756) (9.3)%\nReturn to provision (153,254) (9.4)% — — %\nOther adjustments (2,892) (0.2)% 21,558 3.1 %\nExpense $ 11,390,953 695.1 % $ 68,448 9.8 %\nChanges in the Company’s income tax expense relate primarily to states taxes, change in valuation allowance, changes in tax rates, return-to-provision adjustments, as well as\nchanges in pre-tax income during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Disaster Tax\nRelief Act, enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the ERC for qualified wages paid from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and the credit was increased to 70% of qualified wages\nan eligible employer paid to employees during the extended period. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, further extended the ERC through\nDecember 31, 2021.\nIn October 2022, the Company filed an application with the IRS for the ERC. Employers are eligible for the credit if they experienced full or partial suspension or modification of\noperations during any calendar quarter because of governmental orders due to the pandemic or a significant decline in gross receipts based on a comparison of quarterly revenue\nresults for 2020 and/or 2021 with the comparable quarter in 2019. The Company’s ERC application was equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees during the period from\nJanuary 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 for a maximum quarterly credit of $7,000 per employee. In March 2023, the Company received notice and refunds from the IRS related to the\noverpayment of Federal Employment Tax plus interest in the amount of $4.8 million related to the ERC application. The $4.8 million ERC is subject to a 20% consulting fee. The\nCompany's eligibility remains subject to audit by the IRS for a period of five years.\nSince there are no generally accepted accounting principles for for-profit business entities that receive government assistance that is not in the form of a loan, an income tax credit or\nrevenue from a contract with a customer, we determined the appropriate accounting treatment by analogy to other guidance. We accounted for the ERC by analogy to International\nAccounting Standards (“IAS”) 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, of International Financial Reporting Standards.\nUnder an IAS 20 analogy, a business entity would recognize the ERC on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes the payroll expenses for which the grant\n(i.e., tax credit) is intended to compensate when there is reasonable assurance (i.e., it is probable) that the entity will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and the grant\n(i.e., tax credit) will be received.\nWe have accounted for the $3.8 million ERC, net of the consulting fee, for the year ended December 31, 2023 as other income on the Statement of Income when the Company was\nreasonably assured that the Company met all requirements of the ERC and the grant would be received. The ERC refund is not taxable; however, the credit is subject to expense\ndisallowance rules which increased income tax expense as a discrete item by $0.9 million, net of the consulting expense deduction, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 13: Related Party Transaction\nMr. Jefferson Gramm, Managing Partner of Bandera Partners LLC who is a beneficial holder of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock (approximately 27% as of\nDecember 31, 2023) was appointed to the Board of Directors effective as of January 2, 2024, to serve until the election and qualification of his successor at the 2024 Annual Meeting.\nIn December 2020, we sold two franchise licenses at $39,900 and $29,900 each (which reflects the $10,000 multi-unit discount for the second license per the Franchise Disclosure\nDocument) to Marshall Gramm, who is a family member of Mr. Jefferson Gramm. In April 2020 and 2021, we sold two franchise licenses at $39,900 and $29,900, respectively\n(which reflects the $10,000 multi-unit discount for the second license per the Franchise Disclosure Document), to a franchisee of which Mr. Jefferson Gramm is a 50% co-partner in\nthe business.\nThese transactions involved terms no less favorable to us than those that would have been obtained in the absence of such affiliation. Although we have no way of estimating the\naggregate amount of franchise fees, royalties, advertising fund fees, IT related income and computer software fees that these franchisees will pay over the life of the franchise\nlicenses, the franchisees affiliated with Mr. Gramm are subject to such fees under the same terms and conditions as all other franchisees. These franchisees affiliated with Mr. Gramm\npaid $124,275 and $92,767 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for such royalties and other fees.\nIn October 2020, Mr. Gramm loaned approximately $370,000 to an unaffiliated franchisee that owns and operateso ne franchise clinic. The loan is not secured by the assets of the\nbusiness and there are no foreclosure rights.\nNote 14: Subsequent Events\nOn January 17, 2024, the Company paid down the outstanding balance on its Debt under the Credit Agreement of $2,000,000.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n75\nTable of Contents\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required\nto be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date\ndue to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, described below.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control\nover financial reporting is the process designed under the Chief Executive Officer’s and the Chief Financial Officer’s supervision, and effected by our Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to\nlapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, it is\npossible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria\nset forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).\nAs disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, we previously identified material weaknesses as discussed\nbelow. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to (i) the accounting treatment in significant complex areas and (ii) the identification of uncertain tax positions. We did\nnot design and maintain effective controls over the accounting of complex areas, including accounting for revenue recognition and we did not design and maintain effective controls\nover the identification of uncertain tax positions.\nDuring 2023, management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included modifying internal controls to address completeness of documentation on uncertain\ntax positions, revenue and acquisition related transactions over adoptions of the appropriate respective accounting standards, specifically through the utilization of subject matter\nexperts to review conclusions over complex accounting policies.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded\nthe material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2023.Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that, based on their knowledge, the\nfinancial statements and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial\n76\nTable of Contents\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. BDO, USA, P.C. has issued an unqualified opinion on our\nfinancial statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by BDO, USA, P.C. an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in the\nattestation report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOther than the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nThe Joint Corp.\nScottsdale, Arizona\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The Joint Corp’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and\nour report dated March 7, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n77\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nPhoenix, Arizona\nMarch 7, 2024\nITEM 9B.
