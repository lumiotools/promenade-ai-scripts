Our solutions offer many integrated AI capabilities and cover digital marketing, knowledge management, contact center service, sales productivity, content lifecycle automation, and more.

Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the impact for foreign currency fluctuations or our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the tables provided below in this release. \n\nWe are unable to reconcile any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their directly comparable GAAP financial measures because the information which is needed to complete a reconciliation is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort. Additionally, we are unable to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on components of our income statement beyond revenues because the information which is needed to do so is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort. \n\nUpland defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, other expense (income), net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation costs, purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue and impairment of goodwill. \n\nUpland defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation expenses, purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, non-recurring provision for income tax, impairment of goodwill and the related tax effect of the adjustments above. \n\nUpland defines free cash flow as GAAP operating cash flow less purchases of property and equipment. \n\nUpland defines major accounts as accounts with greater than or equal to $25,000 in annual recurring revenue. \n\nUpland defines major expansions as existing customers who expanded the amount of annual recurring revenue under their contract by at least $25,000. \n\nUpland defines cash gross margin as product revenue less subscription and support cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. \n\nIn connection with periodic reviews of our business, we have decided to discontinue the availability of certain non-strategic product offerings and a limited number of non-strategic customer contracts (collectively referred to as “Sunset Assets”). \n\nOverage Charges are subscription and support revenues earned in addition to contractual minimum customer commitments as a result of the usage volume of services including text and e-mail messaging and third-party pass-through costs that exceed the levels stipulated in contracts with the Company. \n\nUpland defines Core Organic Growth Rate as the percentage change between two reported periods in subscription and support revenue, excluding subscription and support revenue from Sunset Assets and Overage Charges. We calculate our year-over-year Core Organic Growth Rate as though all acquisitions or dispositions closed as of the end of the latest period were closed as of the first day of the prior year period presented. Core Organic Growth Rate does not represent actual organic revenue generated by our business as it stood at the beginning of the respective period. \n\nCore Bookings and Core Churn exclude bookings and churn from Sunset Assets. \n\n**Forward-looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance, including our guidance related to future performance, and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements.

Our solutions offer many integrated AI capabilities and cover digital marketing, knowledge management, contact center service, sales productivity, content lifecycle automation, and more.

Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the impact for foreign currency fluctuations or our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the tables provided below in this release. \n\nWe are unable to reconcile any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their directly comparable GAAP financial measures because the information which is needed to complete a reconciliation is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort. Additionally, we are unable to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on components of our income statement beyond revenues because the information which is needed to do so is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort. \n\nUpland defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, other expense (income), net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation costs, purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue and impairment of goodwill. \n\nUpland defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation expenses, purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, non-recurring provision for income tax, impairment of goodwill and the related tax effect of the adjustments above. \n\nUpland defines free cash flow as GAAP operating cash flow less purchases of property and equipment. \n\nUpland defines major accounts as accounts with greater than or equal to $25,000 in annual recurring revenue. \n\nUpland defines major expansions as existing customers who expanded the amount of annual recurring revenue under their contract by at least $25,000. \n\nUpland defines cash gross margin as product revenue less subscription and support cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. \n\nIn connection with periodic reviews of our business, we have decided to discontinue the availability of certain non-strategic product offerings and a limited number of non-strategic customer contracts (collectively referred to as “Sunset Assets”). \n\nOverage Charges are subscription and support revenues earned in addition to contractual minimum customer commitments as a result of the usage volume of services including text and e-mail messaging and third-party pass-through costs that exceed the levels stipulated in contracts with the Company. \n\nUpland defines Core Organic Growth Rate as the percentage change between two reported periods in subscription and support revenue, excluding subscription and support revenue from Sunset Assets and Overage Charges. We calculate our year-over-year Core Organic Growth Rate as though all acquisitions or dispositions closed as of the end of the latest period were closed as of the first day of the prior year period presented. Core Organic Growth Rate does not represent actual organic revenue generated by our business as it stood at the beginning of the respective period. \n\nCore Bookings and Core Churn exclude bookings and churn from Sunset Assets. \n\n**Forward-looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Organization and Nature of Operations\nUpland Software, Inc. (“Upland,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, enables global businesses to work smarter with over 25 cloud\nsoftware products that help increase revenue, reduce costs, and deliver business value. Upland's solutions offer many integrated AI capabilities and cover\ndigital marketing, knowledge management, contact center service, sales productivity, and content lifecycle automation. Upland services over 10,000 customers\nranging from large global corporations and various government agencies to small and medium-sized businesses. The Company's customers operate in a wide\nvariety of industries, including financial services, consulting services, technology, manufacturing, media, telecommunications, government, insurance, non-\nprofit, healthcare, life sciences, retail, and hospitality.\nThrough a series of acquisitions and integrations, the Company has established a library of diverse software applications under the Upland brand that address\nspecific digital transformation needs. In addition to its strategy to increase core organic growth, Upland may pursue acquisitions within its cloud offerings of\ncomplementary technologies and businesses.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(“GAAP”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Upland Software, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively\nreferred to as “Upland”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. No material\nchanges have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies, in our Annual Report.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. In the opinion of management of the Company, the unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements, in all material respects, and include all\nadjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other period.\nThe financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include those related to revenue\nrecognition, deferred commissions, allowance for credit losses, stock-based compensation, contingent consideration, acquired intangible assets, impairment of\ngoodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, the useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swaps\nand income taxes. In accordance with GAAP, management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management\nbelieves are reasonable under the circumstances. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors;\nhowever, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nUpland is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its\nassets or liabilities as of November 7, 2024, the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change as new events occur and\nadditional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n7\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and the Company’s interest\nrate swaps. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are placed with high quality financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.\nThe Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts, and the Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash\nand cash equivalents. The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to a number of its customers and generally does not require collateral. To\nmanage accounts receivable credit risk, the Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and maintains current expected credit losses which\nconsiders such factors as historical loss information, geographic location of customers, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nNo individual customer represented more than 10% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or more than 10% of accounts receivable\nas of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements - Not Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public\nentities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities\nwith a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and\nreconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis.

ASU 2023-07 should be applied on a retrospective basis.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on its disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an\nannual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.\nASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective\nbasis, and retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\n3. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company recognizes financial instruments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets\nand liabilities. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair\nvalue measurements. The guidance also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.\nThese tiers include Level 1, defined as observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active\nmarkets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring\nan entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, accounts receivable, accounts payable, interest rate\nswaps, and debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value, primarily due to short\nmaturities.\n8\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024\n(unaudited)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds included in cash and cash equivalents $ 37,364 $ — $ — $ 37,364\nInterest rate swaps — 8,576 — 8,576\nTotal $ 37,364 $ 8,576 $ — $ 45,940\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds included in cash and cash equivalents $ 211,661 $ — $ — $ 211,661\nInterest rate swaps — 14,270 — 14,270\nTotal $ 211,661 $ 14,270 $ — $ 225,931\nMoney market funds included in cash and cash equivalents are highly-liquid investments and are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and active\nmarkets, therefore are categorized as Level 1.\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps are measured at the end of each interim reporting period based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted\nif necessary. As the fair value measure is based on the market approach, they are categorized as Level 2.\nDebt\nThe Company believes the carrying value of its long-term debt at September 30, 2024 approximates its fair value based on its variable interest rate feature and\ninterest rates currently available to the Company. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt, before debt discount, at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was $301.0 million and $482.1 million, respectively, based on valuation methodologies using interest rates currently available to the\nCompany which are Level 2 inputs.\n4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nChanges in the Company’s goodwill balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 353,778\nImpairment of goodwill (87,227)\nForeign currency translation adjustment 2,459\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 269,010\nAs a result of the decline of our stock price impacting our market capitalization during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we performed a quantitative\nimpairment evaluation, which resulted in a goodwill impairment of $87.2 million. Our quantitative goodwill impairment analysis applied two methodologies to\nestimate the Company’s fair value which were: a) a discounted cash flow method and b) a guideline public company method. The two methods indicated that\nthe fair value of the Company was less than its carrying value. The discounted cash flow method required significant judgments, including estimation of future\ncash flows, which is dependent on internally developed forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, and determination of our\nweighted average cost of capital. Under the guideline public company method, we estimated fair value based on a market multiple of revenues and earnings\nderived for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating characteristics as the Company. We will continue to evaluate Goodwill for\nimpairment and adjust as indicators arise.\nIntangible assets, net include the estimated acquisition-date fair values of customer relationships, marketing-related assets, and developed technology that the\nCompany recorded as part of its business acquisitions.\n9\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s intangible assets, net (in thousands):\nEstimated Useful Gross Accumulated Net Carrying\nLife (Years) Carrying Amount Amortization Amount\nSeptember 30, 2024: (unaudited)\nCustomer relationships 1-10 $ 360,045 $ 235,505 $ 124,540\nTrade name 1.5-10 9,636 8,010 1,626\nDeveloped technology 4-9 88,154 71,823 16,331\nFavorable Leases 6.3 274 119 155\nTotal intangible assets $ 458,109 $ 315,457 $ 142,652\nEstimated Useful Gross Accumulated Net Carrying\nLife (Years) Carrying Amount Amortization Amount\nDecember 31, 2023:\nCustomer relationships 1-10 $ 378,923 $ 222,436 $ 156,487\nTrade name 1.5-10 10,012 7,862 2,150\nDeveloped technology 4-9 94,103 70,582 23,521\nFavorable Leases 6.3 280 89 191\nTotal intangible assets $ 483,318 $ 300,969 $ 182,349\nManagement recorded no impairments of intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nThe Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that\nmight result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life.\nTotal amortization expense was $13.5 million and $40.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and $17.2 million\nand $53.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n5. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s income tax expense (benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 reflects its estimate of the\neffective tax rates expected to be applicable for the full years, adjusted for any discrete events that are recorded in the period in which they occur. The estimates\nare re-evaluated each quarter based on the estimated tax expense for the full year.\nThe income tax expense of $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is largely comprised of foreign\nincome taxes associated with our combined non-U.S. operations which is partially offset for nine months ended September 30, 2024 by the non-cash impact of\ndeferred taxes related to the goodwill impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe income tax benefit of $1.5 million and $3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, is primarily related to foreign\nincome taxes associated with our combined non U.S. operations , the reduction of uncertain tax position due to expiration of related statutes of limitation\nspecific to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and the non-cash impact of deferred taxes related to the goodwill impairment recorded during the first quarter\nof 2023 impacting the year-to-date balance. These tax benefits are offset by changes in deferred tax liabilities associated with amortization of United States tax\ndeductible goodwill and state taxes in certain states in which the Company does not file on a consolidated basis or have net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe Company historically incurred operating losses in the United States prior to 2021 and, given its cumulative losses and limited history of profits, has\nrecorded a valuation allowance against its United States net deferred tax assets, exclusive of tax deductible goodwill, at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. The company has also recorded valuation allowances in Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom to offset larger losses in those\njurisdictions.\nThe Company has reflected uncertain tax positions primarily within its long-term taxes payable and a portion within deferred tax assets for which the balance is\nimmaterial at September 30, 2024. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, several U.S. state jurisdictions and several\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years ending before December 31, 2020 and is no longer\nsubject to state and local or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ending before December 31, 2019, other than where cross-border\ntransactions extend the statute of limitations. U.S. operating losses generated in years prior to 2020 remain open to adjustment until the statute of limitations\ncloses for the tax year in which the net operating losses are utilized.\n10\n6. Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSenior secured loans (includes unamortized discount of $3,710 and $5,376 based on an imputed\ninterest rate of 6.7% and 7.6%, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) $ 297,290 $ 476,674\nLess current maturities (3,378) (3,172)\nTotal long-term debt $ 293,912 $ 473,502\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) which provided for (i) fully-drawn, 7 year, senior secured term loans (the\n“Term Loans”) and (ii) a $60 million, 5 year, revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”).\nThe Term Loans are repayable on a quarterly basis by an amount equal to 0.25% (1.00% per annum) of the aggregate principal amount of such loan. Any\namount remaining unpaid is due and payable in full on August 6, 2026. The Revolver matured August 6, 2024. No amounts were drawn on the Revolver at the\ntime of its maturity.\nOn August 15, 2024, the Company prepaid $175.0 million of the Term Loans and on September 30, 2024, prepaid an additional $2.0 million principal payment.\nAt the option of the Company, the Term Loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on (i) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus a margin of 2.75% or (ii)\nthe rate (not less than 0.00%) published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (CBA), or as otherwise determined in accordance with the Credit\nFacility (based on a period equal to 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or, if available and agreed to by all relevant Lenders and the Agent, 12 months or such period of less\nthan 1 month) plus a margin of 3.75%. The Base Rate for any day is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the\nFederal Funds Effective Rate (not less than 0.00%) in effect on such day plus ½ of 1.00%, and (iii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate for a one month interest\nperiod beginning on such day plus 1.00%. Accrued interest is paid quarterly or, with respect to Term Loans that are accruing interest based on the Federal\nFunds Effective Rate, at the end of the applicable interest rate period. At September 30, 2024, the floating interest rate was 9.1%.\nCovenants\nThe Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.\nInterest rate swaps\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to limit exposure to interest rate risk related to our debt, effectively\nconverting the entire balance of the Company's Term Loans from variable interest payments to fixed interest rate payments, based on an annualized fixed rate\nof 5.4%, for the 7-year term of debt. At the time the Company entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the Company designated all of the swaps as cash\nflow hedges and as such changes in fair value were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to interest expense, net when\nthe underlying transaction affected earnings.\nIn August 2023, the Company sold a portion of the notional amount of its interest rate swap assets back to the counterparties for $20.5 million. At that time, a\n$20.5 million gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the notional amount sold. That gain is being released to interest\nexpense, net as interest is accrued on the Company’s variable-rate debt over the remaining term of the Term Loans as a decrease to interest expense, net. In\nAugust 2024, the Company prepaid $175 million of the Term Loans and as a result, $9.0 million of the deferred gain was released to interest expense, net.\nIn August 2024, the Company de-designated all of the interest rate swaps in conjunction with the August 2024 debt prepayment. The amount remaining in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss at the de-designation date was $11.4 million and is being amortized to interest expense, net over the effective period of\nthe original interest rate swap agreements. Subsequent to the de-designation, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to interest\nexpense, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in the interest rate swaps fair value of $2.8 million was recognized in\ninterest expense, net.\n11\nThe impact of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on its condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized in Other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on interest rate swaps (3,580) $ 316 (2,917) $ 67\nAmounts reclassified from Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) to interest expense, net (10,848) (3,812) (13,790) (3,812)\nTotal Other comprehensive income (loss) on interest rate\nswaps $ (14,428) $ (3,496) $ (16,707) $ (3,745)\nCash interest costs averaged 6.9% and 5.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n7. Net Loss Per Share\nWe compute loss per share of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”) and Series A Preferred Stock , par value $0.0001 per share\n(“Series A Preferred Stock”) using the two-class method. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be\nallocated between Common Stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been\ndistributed. We consider our Series A Preferred Stock to be a participating security, as its holders are entitled to fully participate in any dividends or other\ndistributions declared or paid on our Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe following table sets forth the computations of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet Loss $ (1,733) $ (8,670) $ (109,302) $ (163,862)\nPreferred stock dividends and accretion (1,406) (1,344) (4,171) (3,988)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (3,139) $ (10,014) $ (113,473) $ (167,850)\nDenominator:\nWeighted–average common shares outstanding, basic\nand diluted 27,292,410 32,579,544 27,850,947 32,438,682\nNet loss per common share, basic and diluted $ (0.12) $ (0.31) $ (4.07) $ (5.17)\n12\nDue to the net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, basic and diluted loss per share were the\nsame. The Company uses the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share on our Series A Preferred Stock. The Company\napplies the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share on our stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock\nunits.\nPotential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be antidilutive. Performance-based\nrestricted stock units are considered dilutive when the related performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of\nthe performance period. All potential shares of common stock are antidilutive in periods of net loss. Potential shares of common stock not included in the\ncomputation of earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive or because the performance criterion was not met were as follows (in\nthousands):\nContingently issuable shares associated with outstanding performance-based restricted stock units (each, a “PSU”) were not included in the basic earnings per\nshare calculations for the periods presented, as the applicable vesting conditions had not been satisfied.\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options 103,561 151,718\nRestricted stock units 2,416,050 2,063,895\nPerformance restricted stock units 350,000 193,750\nSeries A Preferred Stock on an if-converted basis(1) 7,220,813 6,904,813\nTotal anti–dilutive common share equivalents 10,090,424 9,314,176\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock plus accumulated dividends totaled $126.4 million. The Series A Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $17.50 per share, as detailed in\n“Note 9. Mezzanine Equity”.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company has purchase commitments related to hosting services, third-party technology used in the Company's solutions and for other services the\nCompany purchases as part of normal operations. In certain cases these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment.\nLitigation\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings. The Company does not anticipate that any current or\npending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated balances sheets or condensed consolidated statements\nof operations.\n9. Mezzanine Equity\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn July 14, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Ulysses Aggregator, LP (the “Purchaser”), an\naffiliate of HGGC, LLC, to issue and sell at closing 115,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of\n$1,000 per share (the “Initial Liquidation Preference”) for an aggregate purchase price of $115.0 million (the “Investment”).\nOn August 23, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the closing of the Investment (the “Closing”) occurred, and the Series A Preferred Stock was issued to the Purchaser.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company incurred direct and incremental expenses of $4.6 million comprised of\ntransaction fees, and financial advisory and legal expenses which reduced the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nContemporaneous with the Closing Date, the Company and the Purchaser entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”)\nand the Company filed a Certificate of Designation (the “Certificate of Designation”) setting out the powers, designations, preferences, and other rights of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Closing. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,\nthe Purchaser has certain customary registration rights with respect to any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the Common Stock of the Company issuable\nupon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, including rights with respect to the filing of a shelf registration statement, underwritten offering rights and\npiggy back rights.\n13\nDividend Provisions\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s Common Stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights on the distribution of assets on any\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock has an Initial Liquidation Preference of $1,000 per share,\nrepresenting an aggregate Liquidation Preference (as defined below) of $1,000 upon issuance. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to the\ndividend at the rate of 4.5% per annum, within the first seven years after the Closing Date regardless of whether declared or assets are legally available for the\npayment. Such dividends shall accrue and compound quarterly in arrears from the date of issuance of the shares. The dividend rate will increase to 7.0% on the\nseven-year anniversary of the Closing Date. The dividend can be paid, in the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or dividend in kind by adding to the\nLiquidation Preference of each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. On June 7, 2023, the stockholders of the Company authorized, for purposes of\ncomplying with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(b) and (d), the issuance of shares of Common Stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount\nequal to or in excess of 20% of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Series A Preferred Stock (including upon the\noperation of anti-dilution provisions contained in the Certificate of Designation designating the terms of such Series A Preferred Stock). The Series A Preferred\nStock is also entitled to fully participate in any dividends paid to the holders of Common Stock in cash, in stock or otherwise, on an as-converted basis. The\nSeries A Preferred Stock had accrued unpaid dividends of $11.4 million as of September 30, 2024, representing 649,384 Common Stock shares upon\nconversion at $17.50 per share.\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of any Liquidation, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (1) the Initial\nLiquidation Preference per share plus any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Liquidation Preference”) or (2) the amount payable if\nthe Series A Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock will have distribution and liquidation rights senior to all other\nequity interests of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Liquidation Preference of the Series A Preferred Stock was $126.4 million.\nOptional Redemption\nOn or after the 7th anniversary of the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company has the right to redeem any outstanding shares of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock for a cash purchase price equal to 105% of the Liquidation Preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends as of the date of redemption.\nDeemed Liquidation Event Redemption\nUpon a fundamental change, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to require the Company to repurchase any or all of its Series A Preferred\nStock for cash equal to the greater of (1) 105% of the Liquidation Preference plus the present value of the dividend payments the holders would have been\nentitled to through the fifth anniversary of the issue date and (2) the amount that such Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive as if converted into\ncommon shares immediately prior to the fundamental change.\nA fundamental change (“Deemed Liquidation Event”) is defined as either the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or\nsubstantially all the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries to any third party or the consummation of any transaction, the result of which is\nthat any third party or group of third parties become the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the Company.\nVoting Rights\nThe Series A Preferred Stock will vote together with the common shares on all matters and not as a separate class (except as specifically provided in the\nCertificate of Designation or as otherwise required by law) on an as-converted basis. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect one\nmember of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) for so long as holders of the Series A Preferred Stock own in the aggregate at\nleast 5% of the shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect one non-\nvoting observer to the Board of Directors for so long as they hold at least 10% of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date of the\nissue date.\nConversion Feature\nThe Series A Preferred Stock may be converted, at any time in whole or in part at the option of the holder into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to\nthe quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Liquidation Preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends by the conversion price of $17.50 (the\n“Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the following events:\n• Stock splits and combinations\n• Tender offers or exchange offers\n• Distribution of rights, options, or warrants at a price per share that is less than the average of the last reported sale prices per share of Common Stock\nfor the ten consecutive trading days\n• Spin-offs and other distributed property\n14\n• Issuance of equity-linked securities at a price per share less than the conversion price\nAnti-Dilution Provisions\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has customary anti-dilution provisions for stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, sales of significant assets, and reorganization\nevents and recapitalization transactions or similar events, and weighted average anti-dilution protection, subject to customary exceptions for issuances pursuant\nto current or future equity-based incentive plans or arrangements (including upon the exercise of employee stock options).\n10. Stockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nThe common stock has a par value of 0.0001 per share. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote at all meetings of stockholders. The number of\nauthorized shares of common stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the\nholders of shares of capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company\nentitled to vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends, when, if and as declared by our board of directors, whenever funds are\nlegally available therefore, subject to the priority rights of any outstanding preferred stock.\nShare repurchase program\nIn September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Plan”) in the aggregate amount of up to $25 million\nthat allowed the Company to repurchase shares of its issued and outstanding Common Stock. The Share Repurchase Plan expired in May 2024 when the\nCompany had repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase. 6,453,805 total shares were repurchased under the Share Repurchase Plan from September\n2023 through its completion in May 2024.\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company’s net stock repurchases are subject to a 1 percent excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act. The excise tax is included as a\nreduction to accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated statements of equity. Total accrued excise tax of $0.2 million is included in total cost of shares\nrepurchased, excluded from average cost per share and excluded from total cash paid during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as the amount\nwas unpaid at period end.\nNo stock repurchases were made during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nrepurchased and subsequently retired 3,208,705 shares of Common Stock, for a total of $11.0 million cash paid under the Share Repurchase Plan.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Share Repurchase Plan was complete and no further amounts are available for share repurchases.\nTax Benefit Preservation Plan and Preferred Stock Purchase Rights\nEffective June 5, 2024, after approval of the Board and the Companys’ stockholders, the Company entered into the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan with\nBroadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC, as Rights Agent (the “2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan”). By adopting the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan,\nthe Company is seeking to protect its ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and other tax attributes to offset potential future income tax\nliabilities. The Company’s ability to use such NOLs and other tax attributes would be substantially limited if the Company experiences an “ownership change,”\nas defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is intended to make it more difficult for the Company to\nundergo an ownership change by deterring any person from acquiring 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of stock without the approval of the Board of\nDirectors.\nAs part of the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a “2024 Right”) for each outstanding\nshare of Common Stock payable as of June 15, 2024. 27,030,605 2024 Rights were issued to the holders of record of shares of Common Stock. The description\nand terms of the 2024 Rights are set forth in the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan. The 2024 Rights trade with, and are inseparable from, the Common Stock,\nand the record holders of shares of Common Stock are the record holders of the 2024 Rights. The 2024 Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date, as\ndefined in the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan.\nAfter the Distribution Date, each 2024 Right will be exercisable to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Series B Preferred”), at a purchase price of $15.25 per one one-thousandth of a share of\nSeries B Preferred, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2024 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan. Until a 2024 Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder\nthereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company by virtue of holding such Right, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to\nreceive dividends. The Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Series B Preferred issuable and the number of outstanding 2024 Rights to\nprevent dilution that may occur from a stock dividend, a stock split, a reclassification of the Series B Preferred or Common Stock or certain other specified\ntransactions. No adjustments to the Purchase Price of less than 1% are required to be made.\n15\nEach one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Preferred, if issued:\n• Will not be redeemable.\n• Will entitle holders to quarterly dividend payments of $0.001 per one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Preferred, or an amount equal to the\ndividend paid on one share of Common Stock, whichever is greater.\n• Will entitle holders upon liquidation either to receive $0.001 per one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Preferred, or an amount equal to the\npayment made on one share of Common Stock, whichever is greater.\n• Will have the same voting power as one share of Common Stock.\n• If shares of Common Stock are exchanged as a result of a merger, consolidation, or a similar transaction, will entitle holders to a per share payment\nequal to the payment made on one share of Common Stock.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income consists of two elements, net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items are recorded in the\nstockholders’ equity section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive income consists primarily\nof foreign currency translation adjustments for subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, unrealized translation losses on intercompany\nloans with foreign subsidiaries, and realized and unrealized gains on interest rate swaps.\nThe following table shows the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, (“AOCI”) in the stockholders’ equity\nsection of our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign currency translation adjustment $ (18,151) $ (19,947)\nUnrealized translation loss on intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries, net of taxes (862) (3,330)\nUnrealized gain on interest rate swaps, net of amounts reclassified into interest expense, net 11,353 14,270\nRealized gain on interest rate swap sale, net of amounts reclassified into interest expense, net 1,385 15,175\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (6,275) $ 6,168\nThe Company has intercompany loans that were used to fund the acquisitions of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the long-term nature of the loans, the unrealized\ntranslation gains (losses) resulting from re-measurement are recognized as a component of AOCI. The unrealized translation gains (losses) on intercompany\nloans with foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 is net of income tax expense of $3.2 million. The tax impact related to unrealized translation gains\n(losses) on intercompany loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.1 million expense and $0.3 million benefit, respectively. The\ntax impact related to unrealized translation gains (losses) on intercompany loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a $0.8 million\nbenefit and a $0.2 million provision, respectively. The income tax expense/benefit allocated to each component of other comprehensive income for all other\nperiods and components is not material. The Company reclassifies taxes from AOCI to earnings as the items to which the tax effects relate are similarly\nreclassified.\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies. Results of operations for foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States\ndollars (“USD”) using the average exchange rates on a monthly basis during the year. The assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries are translated into USD\nusing the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The related translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity in\nAOCI.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s stock-based compensation generally includes awards of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”).\nKey employees, officers and directors of the Company and its consultants or advisors are eligible to receive awards.\n16\nThe following table summarizes PSU and RSU activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average\nNumber of Units Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested restricted units outstanding as of December 31, 2023 1,858,847 $ 9.76\nGranted 2,142,687 4.12\nVested (1,050,597) 9.03\nForfeited (184,887) 8.71\nUnvested restricted units outstanding as of September 30, 2024 2,766,050 $ 5.73\nThe PSU and RSU activity table above includes 100,000 PSUs granted in 2023 and 250,000 PSUs granted in 2024 based on a 100% target payout.\nCompensation cost related to awards is based on the fair market value at the time of the grant. The fair value of the RSUs is determined based on the grant date\nfair value of the award. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized over the required service period of the grant. The PSUs vest upon the achievement of\nspecified market performance thresholds. The PSUs have a vesting condition that is tied to the Company’s total shareholder return based on the Company’s\nstock performance up to a maximum of 200% and 300%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained, for the\n2023 PSUs and 2024 PSUs, respectively. The fair value of PSUs is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for PSUs is\nrecognized over the requisite service period and is not subject to adjustment regardless of whether the PSUs meet the performance metric.\nThe range of significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model for the PSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as\nfollows:\nExpected volatility 74.6% - 62.06%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.4% - 4.0%\nRemaining performance period (in years) 2.73 - 3.08\nDividend yield —\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense from all awards in the following expense categories included in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of income (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ 199 $ 246 $ 584 $ 850\nResearch and development 470 608 1,714 1,911\nSales and marketing 398 429 1,156 1,563\nGeneral and administrative 2,356 4,077 8,624 13,868\nTotal $ 3,423 $ 5,360 $ 12,078 $ 18,192\n11. Revenue Recognition\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nthe Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when made available to the customers.\nWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of sales credits and allowances. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers,\nwhich are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue is recognized based on the following five step model in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:\n• Identification of the contract with a customer\n• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n• Determination of the transaction price\n17\n• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nPerformance obligations under our contracts consist of subscription and support, perpetual licenses, and professional services revenues within a single\noperating segment.\nSubscription and Support Revenue\nThe Company's software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual\nrights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the\ndate the Company's solution is made available to the customer. As our customers have access to use our solutions over the term of the contract agreement we\nbelieve this method of revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services provided. Our subscription contracts are generally 1 to 3\nyears in length. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or subscription and support revenue, depending on\nwhether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are\nrecognized as subscription and support revenue at the end of each month and are invoiced concurrently. Subscription and support revenue includes revenue\nrelated to the Company’s digital engagement application which provides short code connectivity for its two-way short message service (“SMS”) programs and\ncampaigns. As discussed further in the “Principal vs. Agent Considerations” section below, the Company recognizes revenue related to these messaging-related\nsubscription contracts on a gross basis.\nPerpetual License Revenue\nThe Company also records revenue from the sales of proprietary software products under perpetual licenses. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is\nrecognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. The majority of the Company’s products do not require significant\ncustomization.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services provided with subscription and support licenses and perpetual licenses consist of implementation fees, data extraction, configuration, and\ntraining. The Company’s implementation and configuration services do not involve significant customization of the software and are not considered essential to\nthe functionality. Revenue from professional services are recognized over time as such services are performed. Revenue for fixed price services are generally\nrecognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenue for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the\nservices are performed.\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of accounting. The Company has\ncontracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including professional services sold with either individual or multiple\nsubscriptions or perpetual licenses. For these contracts, the Company records individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct by allocating the\ncontract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”), of each distinct good or\nservice in the contract. We only include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant\nreversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nA contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and is recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is\nsatisfied. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of\nour contracts, historical standalone sales, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nThe Company evaluates whether it is the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis) for vendor reseller\nagreements and messaging-related subscription agreements. Where the Company is the principal, it first obtains control of the inputs to the specific good or\nservice and directs their use to create the combined output. The Company's control is evidenced by its involvement in the integration of the good or service on\nits platform before it is transferred to its customers, and is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers and having a level of\ndiscretion in establishing pricing. While none of the factors individually are considered presumptive or determinative, in reaching conclusions on gross versus\nnet revenue recognition, the Company places the most weight on the analysis of whether or not it is the primary obligor in the arrangement.\nGenerally, the Company reports revenue from vendor reseller agreements on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue,\nand expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenue. As the Company is primarily obligated in its messaging-related subscription contracts, has latitude in\nestablishing prices associated with its messaging program management services, is responsible for fulfillment of the transaction, and has credit risk, we have\nconcluded it is appropriate to record revenue on\n18\na gross basis with related pass-through telecom messaging costs incurred from third parties recorded as cost of revenue. Revenue provided from agreements in\nwhich the Company is an agent are immaterial.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. Billings\nscheduled to occur after the performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue recognition has occurred result in unbilled receivables, which are expected\nto be billed during the succeeding twelve-month period and are recorded in Unbilled receivables in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. A contract\nliability results when we receive prepayments or deposits from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as\nsubscription fees. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed. We recognize\ncontract liabilities as revenue upon satisfaction of the underlying performance obligations. Contract liabilities that are expected to be recognized as revenue\nduring the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in Deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded in Deferred revenue noncurrent on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been billed to or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and prepayments\nreceived from customers in advance for maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue when the\nservices are performed, and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to\ncustomers when services are performed and billed. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The\nterm between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the\nproducts or services are delivered to the customer.\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables represent amounts for which the Company has recognized revenue, pursuant to its revenue recognition policy, for software licenses\nalready delivered and professional services already performed, but invoiced in arrears and for which the Company believes it has an unconditional right to\npayment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unbilled receivables were $3.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force, and related payroll taxes, are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a\ncustomer. Deferred commissions and other costs for new customer contracts are capitalized upon contract signing and amortized on a systematic basis that is\nconsistent with the transfer of goods and services over the expected life of the customer relationships, which has been determined to be approximately 6 years.\nThe expected life of our customer relationships is based on historical data and management estimates, including estimated renewal terms and the useful life of\nthe associated underlying technology. Commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts, as\nsuch, deferred commissions related to renewals are capitalized and amortized over the estimated average contractual renewal term of 18 months. We utilize the\n'portfolio approach' practical expedient permitted under ASC 606-10-10-4, which allows entities to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar\ncharacteristics as the effects on the financial statements of this approach would not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. The\nportion of capitalized costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred commissions, current,\nand the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred commissions, net of current portion. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing\nexpenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commissions are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable consistent with the Company's long-lived assets policy. No indicators of impairment were\nidentified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAmortization of deferred commissions in excess of commissions capitalized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.9 million and\n$1.9 million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue represents either customer advance payments or billings for which the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria have not yet been met.\nDeferred revenue is mainly unearned revenue related to subscription services and support services. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrecognized $90.2 million and $2.0 million of subscription services and professional services revenue, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue\nbalances at the beginning of the period.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately $242.7 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations. We expect to\nrecognize revenue on approximately 70% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.\n19\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by geography and revenue generating activity, as it believes it best depicts how the nature,\namount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nRevenue by geography is based on the ship-to address of the customer, which is intended to approximate where the customers' users are located. The ship-to\ncountry is generally the same as the billing country. The Company has operations primarily in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Information\nabout these operations is presented below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nSubscription and support:\nUnited States $ 45,829 $ 49,884 $ 140,894 $ 152,287\nUnited Kingdom 8,185 9,371 25,657 28,205\nCanada 3,241 3,348 9,786 10,281\nOther International 6,516 7,359 20,016 22,597\nTotal subscription and support revenue 63,771 69,962 196,353 213,370\nPerpetual license:\nUnited States 501 409 2,072 1,786\nUnited Kingdom 100 222 255 514\nCanada 35 38 186 94\nOther International 470 825 1,793 1,923\nTotal perpetual license revenue 1,106 1,494 4,306 4,317\nProfessional services:\nUnited States 1,089 1,522 3,534 4,676\nUnited Kingdom 211 336 725 1,046\nCanada 139 225 473 684\nOther International 376 582 1,376 1,581\nTotal professional service revenue 1,815 2,665 6,108 7,987\nTotal revenue $ 66,692 $ 74,121 $ 206,767 $ 225,674\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.. In addition to historical information,\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and\nother factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nMoreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for\nus to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We\ncannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or\ncircumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made.

Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments\nwe may make.\nOverview\nWe enable global businesses to work smarter with over 25 cloud software products that help increase revenue, reduce costs, and deliver business value. Our\nsolutions offer many integrated AI capabilities and cover digital marketing, knowledge management, contact center service, sales productivity, and content\nlifecycle automation. We service over 10,000 customers ranging from large global corporations and various government agencies as well as small and medium-\nsized businesses. Our customers operate in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, consulting services, technology, manufacturing, media,\ntelecommunications, government, insurance, non-profit, healthcare, life sciences, retail and hospitality.\nThrough a series of acquisitions and integrations, we have established a library of diverse software applications under the Upland brand that address specific\ndigital transformation needs. Our revenue has grown from $149.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $297.9 million in the year ended December\n31, 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate of 15%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, foreign revenue as a percent of\ntotal revenue was 29% and 30%, respectively.\nTo support continued growth, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies and businesses. This may expand our product library, customer base,\nand market access resulting in increased benefits of scale.\n22\nTable of Contents\nKey Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures described below in “Results of Operations,” we regularly review the following key metrics and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions.\nCore Organic Growth Rate\nBeginning with the three months ended June 30, 2023, we began disclosing our Core Organic Growth Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Core\nOrganic Growth Rate as a key performance measure to assess our consolidated operating performance over time and for planning and forecasting purposes.\nCore Organic Growth Rate is the percentage change between two reported periods in subscription and support revenue, excluding subscription and support\nrevenue from Sunset Assets and Overage Charges, each as defined below. We calculate our year-over-year Core Organic Growth Rate as though all acquisitions\nor dispositions closed as of the end of the latest period were closed as of the first day of the prior year period presented. Core Organic Growth Rate does not\nrepresent actual organic revenue generated by our business as it stood at the beginning of the respective period.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our Core Organic Growth Rate was negative 2.3%.\nCore Organic Growth Rates are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or actual results that might have been achieved had certain\nSunset Asset classifications not been made or had certain acquisitions or dispositions been consummated on the first day of the prior year period presented. We\nbelieve that this metric is useful to management and investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance period-over-period along with evaluating\nthe growth of our business normalized for the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, as well as adjusting for the exclusion of non-core Sunset Assets and non-\ncommitted Overage Charges. For example, by including pre-acquisition revenue, Core Organic Growth Rate allows us to measure the underlying revenue\ngrowth of our business as of the end of the period presented, which we believe provides insight into our current performance.\nRelated Defined Terms\nIn connection with periodic reviews of our business, we have decided to discontinue the availability of certain non-strategic product offerings and a limited\nnumber of non-strategic customer contracts (collectively referred to as “Sunset Assets”). It is possible that during future periodic reviews of our business we\nmay determine to add additional non-strategic product offerings or non-strategic customer contracts to Sunset Assets or remove certain product offerings or\ncustomer contracts from the classification of Sunset Assets.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, net interest\nexpense, loss on debt extinguishment, net other expense, benefit from income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, purchase\naccounting deferred revenue discount and impairment of goodwill.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of\nthe periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet loss $ (1,733) $ (8,670) $ (109,302) $ (163,862)\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization expense 13,807 17,692 41,406 54,475\nInterest expense (income), net (2,337) 2,525 7,677 13,362\nOther expense (income), net 229 (103) 109 (911)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 530 (1,471) 1,193 (3,126)\nStock-based compensation expense 3,423 5,360 12,078 18,192\nAcquisition-related expense — 443 — 2,609\nNon-recurring litigation costs 24 277 152 427\nPurchase accounting deferred revenue discount 57 106 198 465\nImpairment of goodwill — — 87,227 128,755\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 14,000 $ 16,159 $ 40,738 $ 50,386\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for\nthe following reasons:\n• Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items that can\nvary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n• Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual\noperating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board\nof directors concerning our financial performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our\ncore operating performance;\n• Adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our\noperations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their\nGAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. The use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\n• Impairment of goodwill and depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized, which contribute to\nthe generation of revenue, will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;\nhowever, much of the depreciation and amortization relates to amortization of acquired intangible assets as well as the goodwill as a result of business\ncombination purchase accounting adjustments, which will not need to be replaced in the future;\n• Adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and\n• Other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA together with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics,\nnet loss and our other GAAP results.\n24\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table set forth our results of operations for the specified periods, as well as our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of\nrevenue.

Other income (expense), net recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 related primarily to\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations.\n31\nTable of Contents\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nBenefit from (provision for) income\ntaxes $ (530) $ 1,471 (136)% $ (1,193) $ 3,126 (138)%\nPercentage of total revenue (2)% 1% —% 1%\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nProvision for income taxes was $0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $1.5 million in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase in expense from income taxes of $2.0 million. The increase for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 related primarily to the foreign income taxes associated with our combined non-U.S. operations.\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $3.1 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the provision of $4.3 million. This increase was largely comprised of foreign taxes associated with our\ncombined non-U.S. operations, and was partially offset by the non-cash impact of deferred taxes related to the goodwill impairment recorded in the first quarter\nof 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operating activities, the raising of capital including sales of our Common Stock or our\nconvertible preferred stock, and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows from operating\nactivities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $59.7 million and $301.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Term Loans that mature\nAugust 6, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $236.6 million and $482.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our Term\nLoans. The $176.8 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due primarily to $11.0 million paid to\nrepurchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and $181.1 million in debt repayment which includes $177.0 million of prepayments made in the current\nquarter, offset by $14.9 million in cash flows from operations.\nOur cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $33.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and $34.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Our\nintent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our domestic\noperations. We do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $1.0 million and a working capital surplus of $169.6 million,\nrespectively.\nCredit Facility\nAs described in “Note 6. Debt—Credit Facility”, the Company has a Credit Facility which includes the fully drawn Term Loans as of September 30, 2024. The\nTerm Loans mature on August 6, 2026. The $60 million revolver under our Credit Facility expired in August 2024 with no amounts outstanding at the time of\nmaturity.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flow data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 14,898 $ 41,154\nNet cash used in investing activities (562) (1,034)\nNet cash used in financing activities (192,838) (48,745)\nEffect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash 1,682 (437)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents (176,820) (9,062)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 236,559 248,653\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 59,739 $ 239,591\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is significantly influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated\ngrowth of our business. Our working capital consists primarily of cash, receivables from customers, prepaid assets, unbilled professional services, deferred\ncommissions, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued expenses, lease liabilities, and deferred revenues. The volume of professional services\nrendered, the volume and timing of customer bookings and contract renewals, and the related timing of collections on those bookings and renewals, as well as\nthe timing of spending commitments and payments of our accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, all affect these account\nbalances.\nCash provided by operating activities was $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of\n$41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately $26.3 million driven by the $54.6 million decrease in net loss, and\noffset by the one-time $20.5 million cash gain on the sale of a portion of our interest rate swaps in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other changes\nin cash provided by operating activities were due to a decrease in non-cash interest expense, net related to the $9.0 million deferred gain that was released to\ninterest expense, net, upon the prepayment of $175 million of the Company’s debt in August 2024 as compared to the $2.8 million deferred gain that was\nreleased to interest expense, net upon prepayment of $35 million of the Company’s debt in August 2023 as well as changes in working capital for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 which include collections on accounts receivable, increases in prepaid and other current assets, payments of current\nliabilities and decreases in deferred revenue.\nA substantial source of cash is invoicing for subscriptions and support fees in advance, which is recorded as deferred revenue, and is included on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of booked fees for our software subscriptions and support, which is\namortized into revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. We assess our liquidity, in part, through an analysis of new subscriptions invoiced,\nexpected cash receipts on new and existing subscriptions, and our ongoing operating expense requirements.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nHistorically, our primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions of complementary technologies and businesses. As our business grows and evolves,\nwe expect our primary investing activities to continue to expand and refine our product library, customer base, and market access, as well as routine purchases\nof office equipment.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $0.6 million compared\nto $1.0 million of purchases of property and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in purchases of property and equipment\nwas related to a one-time purchase of office software during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nHistorically, our primary financing activities have consisted of capital raised to fund our acquisitions, proceeds from debt obligations incurred to finance our\nacquisitions, repayments and servicing of our debt obligations, share repurchases and share based employee payroll tax payment activity.\nCash used in financing activities was $192.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $48.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, an increase of $144.1 million of cash used due to $142.0 million in additional payments on the Company’s Term Loans in the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 over payments made in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an additional $7.7 million used for Common Stock\nrepurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases in cash used were offset by $5.6\nmillion less cash used in nine months ended\n33\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024 for payments for additional consideration to sellers of businesses than in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The\npreparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are\ndifferences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will\nbe affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate\nto the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements:\n• income taxes; and\n• goodwill and other intangibles.\nWe are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying value of\nour assets or liabilities as of November 7, 2024, the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change as new events occur\nand additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther Key Accounting Policies\nOur unaudited interim financial statements and other financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as presented herein and in\n“Item 1. Financial Statements” to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, reflect no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as set forth\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). Please refer to our Annual Report for a detailed description\nof our critical accounting policies that involve significant management judgment.\nWe evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are\nreasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions,\njudgments or conditions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, refer to “Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\n34\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks\nprimarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries\nwhere we conduct business. Any impact on our statement of operations is mitigated by having an offsetting liability in deferred revenue to partially or\ncompletely offset against the outstanding receivable if an account should become uncollectible. Our cash balances are kept in customary operating accounts, a\nportion of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and uninsured money market accounts. The majority of our cash balances in money\nmarket accounts are with the lender under our Credit Facility. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk\nexposures. We also have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our cash equivalents and variable rate indebtedness.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This objective is\naccomplished currently by making diversified investments, consisting only of money market mutual funds and FDIC insured institutional liquid deposit\naccounts.\nThe Company has floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to limit exposure to interest rate risk related to our debt with an annualized fixed rate of 5.4%\nthrough the maturity of the Term Loans. The total notional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $256.5 million at September 30, 2024. The\nCompany’s Term Loans have a floating interest rate of 9.1% based on the interest rate as described in “Note 6. Debt. The effective cash interest rate for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.9%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of $301.0 million under our Term Loans that mature August 6, 2026. Based on the Company’s\noutstanding balance of variable rate debt at September 30, 2024, a hypothetical change of 100 basis points could have resulted in a $1.5 million increase to total\ninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur customers are generally invoiced in the currency of the country in which they are located. In addition to the United States dollar, we incur a portion of our\noperating expenses in foreign currencies, including Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Indian Rupees, British pounds, Euros, and Israeli New Shekels and in\nthe future as we expand into other foreign countries, we expect to incur operating expenses in other foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to foreign\nexchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our international operations and our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. The effect\nof a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business could have resulted in a change in revenue of $4.6 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. We have not previously engaged in any currency hedging strategies. If we decide to hedge our foreign currency\nexchange rate exposure, we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience, unreasonable costs, or illiquid markets. As our international\noperations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe non-financial assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet\ndate. The related translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In\naddition, we have intercompany loans that are used to fund the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the long-term nature of these loans, the foreign\ncurrency gains (losses) resulting from remeasurement are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n35\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures\nas of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of December 31, 2023, management identified a material\nweakness in the design and operation of a management review control over prospective financial information used in the Company’s goodwill impairment\nassessment, and specifically, not sufficiently performing and documenting the reasonableness of significant assumptions used therein. Our remediation efforts\nwith respect to this material weakness are continuing, and we have determined that this material weakness is continuing as of September 30, 2024. As a result,\nour management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weakness, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly\nreport on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity\nwith GAAP.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has evaluated the material weakness described above and designed a\nremediation plan to enhance our internal control environment. To remediate the material weakness, we plan to enhance the design, including the precision, of\nmanagement’s review control over prospective financial information used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, the evaluation\nof significant assumptions utilized in the development of that prospective financial information. In addition, we will retain incremental evidence of the\nexecution of such procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the material weakness described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and\n15d- 15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns\nresulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of\nsuch limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes\nduring 2024 to the risk factors that were included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as shown below.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to properly remediate this material weakness or if we are\notherwise unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, material misstatements in our financial statements could\noccur and we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, the trading price of our common stock, and our ability to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a management review control over prospective financial\ninformation used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, not sufficiently performing and documenting the reasonableness of\nsignificant assumptions used therein. See Part I, Item 4 “Controls and Procedures” of this quarterly report for additional information about this material\nweakness and our remediation efforts.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that\na material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our\ncommon stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or regulatory investigations. We continue to evaluate and implement steps\nto remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will\nultimately have the intended effects. The material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the\nmanagement review control operates for a sufficient period of time and management concludes, through testing, that the control operates effectively. If we do\nnot successfully remediate the material weakness, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately\nreport our financial results, specifically potential goodwill impairments, which could cause our financial results to be materially misstated. In such case, we\nmay be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports, which could adversely affect investor\nconfidence in us, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the trading price of our common stock, and our ability to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nItem 5. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) or directors adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act).\nItem 6.
