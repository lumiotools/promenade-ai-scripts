Demand for these solutions is anticipated to accelerate along with coordinated General Semiconductor and Automotive market recovery through fiscal year 2025.\"\n\nThe transition to emerging chiplet and heterogeneous applications — which are enabling new levels of performance and transistor density — position Kulicke & Soffa for additional share gains within leading-edge logic. Beyond this emerging FTC solution which is supporting leading-edge assembly transitions; high-volume memory, automotive and LED applications are also requiring new assembly solutions which can deliver package-level transistor density improvements. These growing market needs are being directly supported through Kulicke & Soffa's portfolio of vertical wire, advanced dispense and advanced display solutions.\n\n**_Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * Net revenue of $706.2 million.\n  * Gross margin of 38.1%.\n  * Net loss of $69.0 million or $(1.24) per fully diluted share; non-GAAP net income of $1.6 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share.\n  * GAAP cash from operations of $31.0 million; Adjusted free cash flow of $14.9 million.\n  * The Company repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $151.0 million.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $577.1 million as of September 28, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * Net revenue of $181.3 million.\n  * Gross margin of 48.3%.\n  * Net income of $12.1 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share; non-GAAP net income of $18.5 million or $0.34 per fully diluted share.\n  * GAAP cash from operations of $31.6 million; Adjusted free cash flow of $29.2 million.\n  * The Company repurchased a total of 1.0 million shares of common stock at a cost of $42.7 million.\n\n\n\n**_First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Outlook_**\n\nThe Company currently expects net revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2025, ending December 28, 2024, to be approximately $165.0 million, +/- $10 million, GAAP diluted EPS to be approximately $1.45 +/- 10%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be approximately $0.28, +/- 10%. This outlook includes favorable claim/proceeds relating to cessation of business due to the cancellation of Project W - which was disclosed on March 11, 2024.\n\n_A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial outlook is provided in the financial tables included at the end of this press release._\n\n**_Earnings Conference Webcast_**\n\nA webcast to discuss these results will be held tomorrow, November 14, 2024, beginning at 8:00am EST. The live webcast link, supplemental earnings presentation, and archived webcast will be available at [__investor.kns.com__](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302313-1&h=1940446032&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.kns.com%2F&a=investor.kns.com). To access the audio-only portion of the live webcast, parties may call +1-877-407-8037 or internationally +1-201-689-8037.\n\nA replay will be available from approximately one hour after the completion of the call by calling toll-free +1-877-660-6853 or internationally +1-201-612-7415 and using the replay ID number of 13743544.\n\n**_Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results_**\n\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains the following non-GAAP financial results: income from operations, operating margin, net income, net margin, net income per fully diluted share and adjusted free cash flow. The Company's non-GAAP results exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, costs associated with restructuring and severance, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration cost, impairment relating to assets acquired through business combinations, long-lived asset impairment relating to business cessation or disposal, impairment relating to equity investments, income tax expense arising from discrete tax items triggered by acquisition, disposal of business (both via a sale or an abandonment), restructuring and significant changes in tax laws, gain/loss on disposal of business, as well as tax benefits or expenses associated with the foregoing non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP adjustments may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature, but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company's operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors' understanding of the Company's underlying operational performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results and the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors.\n\nManagement uses both U.S. GAAP metrics as well as non-GAAP metrics to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company's reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP items is meant to supplement, but not substitute for, GAAP financial measures or information. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results in combination with GAAP results provides better transparency to the investment community when analyzing business trends, providing meaningful comparisons with prior period performance and enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure discussed in this press release is contained in the financial tables at the end of this press release.\n\n**_About Kulicke & Soffa_**\n\nFounded in 1951, Kulicke & Soffa specializes in developing cutting-edge semiconductor and electronics assembly solutions enabling a smart and more sustainable future.

While existing die-to-wafer hybrid bonding capacity can enable significant I/O density – yield challenges, cost of ownership, and front-end processing requirements are limiting the adoption rate and market potential of existing hybrid solutions.\n\nThe CuFirst hybrid solution, utilizing the K&S APTURA FTC platform, addresses these production limitations and challenges. With the emerging CuFirst process, the copper interconnect is bonded first – leveraging the APTURA platform's FTC capability – then the dielectric (SiOx) connection is made once the device returns to room temperature. This CuFirst process is expected to support higher yields, lower infrastructure costs and better cost of ownership compared to conventional die-to-wafer hybrid bonding. In addition to CuFirst hybrid, the APTURA FTC system also supports traditional flux- and fluxless-based thermo-compression bonding (TCB), including the direct bonding of copper-to-copper pillars – down to an 8µm pitch. This system can also accommodate die-to-die, die-to-substrate, or die-to-wafer configurations comprehensively addressing a broad range of material handling and end-application requirements.\n\n\"Through ongoing R&D commitments and collaborations, we have become a critical enabler supporting the industry's transition to a chiplet ecosystem. Our TCB business has grown by ten times over the past four years, and industry momentum continues to accelerate,\" said Bob Chylak, Kulicke and Soffa's Chief Technology Officer.\n\nThe Company expects its leadership in FTC to further extend as the need for more complex assembly solutions continue to grow. During fiscal year 2025, K&S anticipates its TCB business will increase by 40-50% sequentially, driven by broadening adoption in leading-edge compute, optical, communications and industrial markets.\n\n**About Kulicke & Soffa**\n\nFounded in 1951, Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. specializes in developing cutting-edge semiconductor and electronics assembly solutions enabling a smarter and more sustainable future.
