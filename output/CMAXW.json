(NASDAQ: CMAX; CMAXW) (“CareMax” or the “Company”), a leading technology-enabled value-based care delivery system, today announced it has entered into an agreement to sell its management services organization and also announced a sale process for the Company’s core centers’ assets (collectively, the “Sale Transactions”). The Sale Transactions will be implemented pursuant to a prearranged chapter 11 plan supported and funded by 100 percent of CareMax’s current secured lenders (the “Prearranged Plan”). \n\nCareMax has entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Revere Medical (formerly known as Rural Health Group), pursuant to which Revere Medical will acquire the Medicare Shared Savings Program portion of the Company’s management services organization (the “MSO Business”) that supports care provided to approximately 80,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The sale of the MSO Business is anticipated to be consummated simultaneously with the consummation of CareMax’s Prearranged Plan. The Company intends to wind down the ACO REACH and Medicare Advantage portions of its management services organization. \n\nCareMax also announced that it has reached an agreement in principle on a “stalking horse” agreement with a third-party buyer for the Company’s operating clinic business (the “Core Centers’ Assets”). The closing of this sale is also anticipated to be consummated simultaneously with the consummation of CareMax’s Prearranged Plan. The Company intends to disclose the proposed terms of the stalking horse agreement and the potential purchaser in the coming days, when and if an agreement is finalized. \n\nThe stalking horse bid will be subject to an auction and, if an agreement with the stalking horse bidder is not finalized in the coming days, CareMax’s current secured lenders – who have been providing capital to the business for the past four months – will credit bid for the Core Centers Assets. The sale process is intended to ensure patient and doctor continuity and CareMax’s secured lenders are committed to supporting the business throughout this process. \n\nTo facilitate the foregoing, CareMax has initiated prearranged voluntary chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \"Court\"). CareMax has also filed customary motions with the Court, seeking authorization to maintain business-as-usual operations, including by: \n\n  * Continuing operations to ensure patients at its clinics continue to receive high-quality, value-based healthcare; \n  * Paying associated wages, including for its doctors and nurses, without interruption; and \n  * Paying the existing pre-petition claims of certain vendors that are critical to the health and safety of CareMax’s patients and critical to the operation of the Company's medical centers. \n\n\n\nThese motions, once approved, will help facilitate a smooth transition into the restructuring process and ensure the Company's medical centers and physicians can continue providing uninterrupted service to patients. \n\nSimultaneously, CareMax entered into a restructuring support agreement (the \"RSA\") with lenders holding 100 percent of the Company’s secured debt obligations. The RSA provides for, among other things, the lenders’ support for the Sale Transactions and the Prearranged Plan and the lenders’ agreement to provide CareMax with a $30.5 million debtor in possession financing facility to support CareMax’s operations through confirmation of the Prearranged Plan (the “DIP Financing”). \n\nThe Prearranged Plan, the Sale Transactions, the RSA, and the DIP Financing are subject to Court approval, as well as customary regulatory approval and closing conditions. CareMax anticipates that the Sale Transactions and Prearranged Plan will be consummated in early 2025. \n\nCareMax will continue to operate and maintain its commitment to providing high-quality patient care and services. The DIP Financing is expected to provide sufficient liquidity to support the Company's ongoing operations throughout the restructuring process. \n\nCarlos de Solo, Chief Executive Officer of CareMax, commented, “After a careful review of the Company’s strategic alternatives, we have determined that the transactions announced today are our best opportunity to protect the long-term value of the CareMax assets and ensure our patients, providers, and health plans can continue to rely on the comprehensive, coordinated care we provide. We are deeply appreciative of the outstanding team members across CareMax, whose hard work and commitment to our partners is resolute.” \n\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s court-supervised process, court filings, and information about the claims process can be found at [https://cases.stretto.com/CareMax](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcases.stretto.com%2FCareMax&esheet=54153963&newsitemid=20241117000726&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fcases.stretto.com%2FCareMax&index=1&md5=b71faa97c678e0ac73be84c9febe9eda), a website administered by CareMax’s claims agent, Stretto, Inc.

For a detailed discussion of the risk factors that could affect the Company's actual results, please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's reports filed with the SEC. All information provided in this press release is as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no duty to update or revise this information unless required by law, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nCertain financial information and data contained in this press release is unaudited and does not conform to Regulation S-X. Accordingly, such information and data may not be included in, may be adjusted in, or may be presented differently in, any periodic filing, information or proxy statement, or prospectus or registration statement to be filed by the Company with the SEC. Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Platform Contribution and margin thereof have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures of financial results are not GAAP measures of our financial results or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial results, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. \n\nThe Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating projected operating results and trends in and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. For this reason, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly labeled non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. \n\nA reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA and Platform Contribution to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below. \n\n**CAREMAX, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(in thousands, except share and per share data)** **(Unaudited)**

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN\nCareMax, Inc. (“CareMax” or the “Company”), formerly Deerfield Healthcare Technology Acquisitions Corp. (“DFHT”), is a\nDelaware corporation, which announced its initial public offering in July 2020 (the “IPO”) as a publicly traded special purpose\nacquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or\nsimilar business combination involving one or more businesses. CareMax provides high-quality, value-based care and chronic disease\nmanagement through physicians and health care professionals committed to the overall health and wellness continuum of care for its\npatients. As of June 30, 2024, the Company operated 50 centers and managed affiliated providers across 10 states that offer a\ncomprehensive suite of healthcare and social services, and a proprietary software and services platform that provides data, analytics,\nand rules-based decision tools/workflows for physicians across the United States.\nThe Business Combination and Acquisitions\nOn December 18, 2020, DFHT entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with\nCareMax Medical Group, L.L.C., a Florida limited liability company (“CMG”), and entities listed in the Business Combination\nAgreement, IMC Medical Group Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“IMC”), IMC Holdings, LP, a Delaware\nlimited partnership, and Deerfield Partners, L.P. The Business Combination (as defined below) closed on June 8, 2021 (the “Closing\nDate”), whereby DFHT acquired 100% of the equity interests in CMG and 100% of the equity interests in IMC, with CMG and IMC\nbecoming wholly owned subsidiaries of DFHT. Immediately upon completion (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the\nBusiness Combination Agreement and the related financing transactions (the “Business Combination”), the name of the combined\ncompany was changed to CareMax, Inc.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Business\nCombination, to CMG and its subsidiaries, and, for periods upon or after the completion of the Business Combination, to CareMax, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries.\nSubsequent to consummation of the Business Combination, primarily during the second half of 2021, the Company acquired Senior\nMedical Associates, LLC, Stallion Medical Management, LLC, Unlimited Medical Services of Florida, LLC, Advantis Physician\nAlliance, LLC, Business Intelligence & Analytics LLC, and three additional businesses.\nIn November 2022, the Company acquired the Medicare value-based care business of Steward Health Care System (“Steward Value\nBased Care”, and such transaction the “Steward Acquisition”). On May 6, 2024, Steward Health Care System LLC (“Steward Health\nCare System”) and certain of its affiliates commenced an in-court restructuring process through the filing of voluntary petitions for\nrelief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into or acquired certain contracts with affiliates of Steward Health Care System in connection with the\nSteward Acquisition. In June 2024, as part of these bankruptcy proceedings, Steward Health Care System moved to reject certain of\nsuch executory contracts. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for further information.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going\nconcern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of\nbusiness. The Company has generated recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since completion of the Business\nCombination, and believes that, absent the Company successfully taking certain measures to reduce operating expenses and/or divest\ncertain assets or businesses, as set forth below, the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows for the\nforeseeable future. The Company obtained a limited waiver of certain breaches of financial and administrative covenants under the\nCredit Agreement (as defined below) through August 15, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of\ncertain specified events, as further explained in Note 7, Debt and Related Party Debt. Further, as of June 30, 2024, the Company was in\nbreach of certain financial and administrative covenants (such as the failure to pay rent when it came due) and were in default under\ncertain of its lease agreements, as further explained in Note 12, Leases. Although the Company had $16.4 million in cash and cash\nequivalents and $97.5 million of accounts receivable, net, at June 30, 2024, absent the Company successfully implementing\nmanagement’s plans as set forth below, the Company believes it will not be able to comply with the minimum liquidity requirement and\nmaximum leverage ratio covenants contained in its Credit Agreement once the current limited waiver expires, nor will it be able to\ncomply with certain financial\n(6)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\ncovenants under certain of the Company’s leases. The Company has appointed a Chief Restructuring Officer and engaged external\nconsultants to provide it with restructuring and transactional services and related legal advice and assistance.\nTo address the Company’s capital needs, the Company is undergoing efforts to reduce operating expenses and pursuing various equity\nand debt refinancing and other strategic alternatives, including the sale of certain assets. If the Company is unable to successfully\nimplement its plans or receive adequate relief from its creditors and lessors, the Company would likely to restructure under Chapter 11\nof the US Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the Company has determined that substantial doubt exists regarding its ability to continue as\na going concern as of the date of this filing.\nThere is no guarantee that the Company will be able to implement its operational plans or raise additional equity or debt financing on\nacceptable terms, if at all. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been\nprepared on a going concern basis of accounting and these financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized impairment charges related to\ncertain asset groups and abandoned leases related to the triggering events that occurred as further described in Note 5, Goodwill and\nOther Intangible Assets, Note 6, Property and Equipment, and Note 12, Leases. The impairment analysis involved significant judgment\nand actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. We may be required to record additional impairment charges in the\nfuture.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn January 31, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s\nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every thirty shares of\nthe Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date automatically converted into one share of Class A Common\nStock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, stockholders of record\nwho otherwise would have been entitled to receive fractional shares were entitled to rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest\nwhole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted, based on a 1-for-30 split ratio, all issued and outstanding\nshares of the Company’s common stock, as well as the terms of warrants outstanding at the time of the effectiveness of the Reverse\nSplit. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of all\noutstanding stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. There was no change in the par value of our Common\nStock or Preferred Stock.\nReferences to number of shares of Class A Common Stock and per share data (except par value) in the financial statements and notes\nthereto for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.\nLong-lived Asset Impairments\nThe Company reviews recoverability of its long-lived assets, including other intangible assets, property and equipment, and right-of-use\nassets, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. During the three months\nended June 30, 2024, the Company performed an impairment assessment of its asset groups. The impairment assessment was triggered\nby the rejection by Steward Health Care System of certain contracts, as further explained in section The Business Combination and\nAcquisitions above. The impairment assessment was also triggered by the Company’s abandonment of a number of leased properties\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a decision to cease use of additional leased properties following June 30, 2024.\nBased on the results of these events and the impairment assessments, the Company recognized impairments of long-lived assets of\n$133.0 million, consisting of:\n• Property and equipment impairments and finance right-of-use asset abandonments of $25.2 million (Refer to Note 6,\nProperty and Equipment, for further information);\n• Operating right-of-use asset abandonments of $59.0 million (Refer to Note 12, Leases, for further information); and\n• Other intangible asset impairments of $48.8 million (Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for further\ninformation).\n(7)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation\nS-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts and operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated\nupon consolidation. Certain amounts in the prior year’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to\nconform to the current year presentation.\nThere is no comprehensive income (loss) so the statements of comprehensive income (loss) are not presented.\nSegment Financial Information\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews financial\noperating results on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company\nidentifies operating segments based on this review by its CODM and operates in and reports as a single operating segment. For the\nperiods presented, materially all of the Company’s long-lived assets were located in the United States, and all revenue was earned in the\nUnited States.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOther than the addition of the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets policy, there have been no changes to our significant accounting\npolicies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with\nthe SEC on March 18, 2024.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\nareas where significant estimates are used in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenues and related receivables\nfrom risk adjustments, costs of our services and related liabilities, purchase price allocations, including fair value estimates of\nintangibles and contingent consideration, the valuation and related impairment testing of long-lived assets, including goodwill and\nintangible assets, the valuation of derivative liabilities, and the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets, including\ninternally developed software. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the\ncarrying value of the asset to the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, which include\nthe amount and timing of the projected future cash flows. If the expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the\nasset, then the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying value is written down to fair value.\nFair value estimates used in the impairment review of long-lived assets are determined using a future cash flow model involving several\nassumptions. Changes in the Company’s assumptions could materially impact fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to our fair\nvalue estimates are: (i) projected cash flows and (ii) discount rates. These and other assumptions may change in the future based on\nspecific facts and circumstances. While the Company believes the assumptions used to estimate the future cash flows are reasonable,\nthere can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized. As a result, impairment charges that possibly would have\nbeen recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from estimates. The\nuse of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted cash flows, and therefore could change impairment determinations.\nAsset impairment charges are recognized based on the relative fair value of the long-lived assets. Asset impairment charges are\nrecognized in impairments of long-lived assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(8)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nEmerging Growth Company\nSection 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) exempts emerging growth companies from being\nrequired to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a\nSecurities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS\nAct provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-\nemerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended\ntransition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private\ncompanies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt\nthe new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements with another\npublic company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the\nextended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Additionally, as an\nemerging growth company, the Company is exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, as amended, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to evaluate and report on\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives\nand Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s\nOwn Equity, which is intended to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity,\nincluding convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or\nmodified retrospective adoption. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This guidance requires annual\nand interim disclosure of significant segment expenses that are provided to the CODM as well as interim disclosures for all reportable\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets. This guidance also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of\nhow the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources. This guidance is expected to improve financial reporting by providing additional information about a public company’s\nsignificant segment expenses and more timely and detailed segment information reporting throughout the fiscal period. The ASU is\neffective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this accounting\nstandard will have on its financial disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-\n09”). ASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information\non income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. The guidance will be applied on a\nprospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact that adoption of this accounting standard will have on its financial disclosures.\nNOTE 3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are presented net of the unpaid external provider costs. A right of offset exists when all of the\nfollowing conditions are met: 1) each of the two parties owed the other determinable amounts; 2) the reporting party has the right to\noffset the amount owed with the amount owed to the other party; 3) the reporting party intends to offset; and 4) the right of offset is\nenforceable by law. The Company believes all of the aforementioned conditions existed as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $44.5 million and $8.9 million of accounts receivable, which were expected to be\ncollected after twelve months, were included in other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(9)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company re-evaluated key assumptions and estimates and based on this analysis, the Company identified changes in estimates to\nrevenue, external provider costs, short-term and long-term accounts receivable, net, and risk settlement liabilities. Accordingly, the\nCompany recognized the following changes in prior year estimates in each respective period (in thousands):\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nIncrease (decrease) 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 8,475 $ (22,964)\nExternal provider costs (12,231) (1,736)\nShort-term and long-term accounts receivable, net (926) (21,228)\nRisk settlement liabilities (21,631) —\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the favorable net development was driven by favorable Medicare risk revenue settlements\nrelated to 2023, compared to prior accruals including reserves for risk revenues, and by favorable development in Medicare and\nMedicaid risk medical expenses relative to prior accruals and provisions for adverse deviation. For the six months ended June 30, 2023,\nthe developments related to the prior year dates of service were primarily driven by new, updated information regarding MSO\nmembership at one health plan, an unseasonably early flu season, and more current data from one Medicaid health plan.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nComposition of the Company’s revenues and accounts receivable balances for the payors comprising 10% or more of revenue was as\nfollows (n/a - indicates balance or activity that is less than 10%):\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended June 30, Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024\n2024 2023 2023\nPayor A 22% 20% 22% 26%\nPayor B 14% 14% 11% n/a\nPayor C 19% 19% 21% 22%\nPayor D n/a 11% 11% 12%\nPayor E 12% 11% 13% 16%\nPayor F n/a n/a 10% n/a\nShort-Term and Long-Term Accounts Receivable, net\nAs of June 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nPayor A n/a 10%\nPayor B n/a 10%\nPayor C n/a n/a\nPayor D n/a n/a\nPayor E n/a n/a\nPayor F 70% 54%\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s provision for credit losses was $2.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nNOTE 4. REINSURANCE\nThe Company purchases stop loss insurance on catastrophic costs to limit the exposure on patient losses. Premiums and policy\nrecoveries are reported in external provider costs in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe intent of the Company’s stop loss coverage is to limit the benefits paid for any individual patient. The Company’s stop loss limits\nare defined within each respective health plan contract or other third-party contract and range typically from $30,000 to $300,000 per\npatient per year. Premium expense incurred was $7.4 million and $15.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nrespectively and $6.2 million and $12.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Physicians under\ncapitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a\nmaximum amount on an annual basis. The Company monitors the financial performance and solvency of its stop loss providers.\nHowever, the Company remains financially responsible for health care services to its members in the event the health plans or other\nthird parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under stop loss contractual terms.\n(10)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nRecoveries recognized were $3.4 million and $11.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $6.3\nmillion and $10.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Estimated recoveries under stop loss policies\nare reported within accounts receivable, net, or risk settlement liabilities as the counterparty responsible for the payment of the claims\nand the stop loss is the respective health plan.\nNOTE 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe Company’s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, or on an interim basis if an event triggering\nimpairment may have occurred.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company identified a number of triggering events, including the reduction in the market value of the\nCompany’s Class A Common Stock, and the motion by Steward Health Care System to reject certain of the Company’s provider\ncontracts entered into or acquired as part of the Steward Acquisition. We estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit based on\nthe Company’s market capitalization. In addition, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment on an enterprise basis by comparing\nthe carrying value of its debt and equity to fair value. As a result of these analyses, the Company concluded that its fair value exceeded\nits carrying value and no goodwill impairment was identified. The Company estimates that a decrease of up to 30% in the estimated fair\nvalue of debt would not result in recognition of goodwill impairment.\nAs of March 31, 2024, our total shareholders’ equity exceeded our market capitalization. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of\nour single reporting unit primarily on the basis of the Company’s market capitalization after considering reasonable control premiums\nwhich could be expected in transactions with third-party market participants. Based on this analysis, no goodwill impairment was\nidentified.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company’s market capitalization was below its carrying value, which management believed to be a triggering\nevent requiring an interim goodwill impairment quantitative analysis. Accordingly, the Company performed a market capitalization\nreconciliation to further evaluate the Company’s estimated fair value balance as of June 30, 2023 and support the implied control\npremium. Based on the quantitative analysis performed, management concluded that the Company's estimated fair value exceeded its\ncarrying value by approximately $20 million, or 3.0%. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment was recorded during the three months\nended June 30, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2023, the economic uncertainty and market volatility resulting from the rising interest rate environment, the recent\nbanking crisis and other industry developments resulted in a decrease in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization.\nManagement believed such a decrease was a triggering event requiring an interim goodwill impairment quantitative analysis. The\nCompany performed a market capitalization reconciliation to evaluate the Company’s estimated fair value balance and support the\nimplied control premium. Based on the quantitative analysis performed, the Company’s estimated fair value as of March 31, 2023 was\nless than its carrying value as of March 31, 2023 by 17.9% or $98.0 million. The $98.0 million goodwill impairment charge has been\nreflected in goodwill impairment in the accompanying statements of operations during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s cumulative goodwill impairment was $617.2 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe following tables summarize the gross carrying amounts, accumulated amortization and net carrying amounts of intangible assets by\nmajor class (in thousands):\nImpairm Net\nGross Carrying Accumulated ent Carrying\nAmount Amortization Charges Value\nJune 30, 2024\nRisk contracts $ 102,070 $ (46,073) $ (23,550) $ 32,446\nProvider network 42,900 (10,044) (25,228) 7,628\nNon-compete agreements 4,170 (2,753) — 1,417\nTrademarks 1,862 (1,561) — 301\nOther 693 (323) — 370\nTotal $ 151,695 $ (60,754) $ (48,778) $ 42,163\n(11)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNet\nGross Carrying Accumulated Carrying\nAmount Amortization Value\nDecember 31, 2023\nRisk contracts $ 102,070 $ (39,394) $ 62,676\nProvider network 42,900 (6,980) 35,920\nNon-compete agreements 4,170 (2,343) 1,827\nTrademarks 1,862 (1,491) 371\nOther 693 (244) 449\nTotal $ 151,695 $ (50,452) $ 101,243\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. In June 2024, as part of their bankruptcy proceedings, Steward Health Care System moved to reject certain of its contracts\nwith the Company that were entered into or acquired as part of the Steward Acquisition, which served as a triggering event for the MSO\nasset group. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Going Concern, for further information.\nRecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the MSO asset group to the\nestimated undiscounted future cash flows. The carrying amount exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows and based on further\nassessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the underlying long-lived assets\nwithin the MSO asset group exceeded their fair values. The fair value of the intangible assets was determined using an excess earnings\nmodel. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded resulting impairment charges of $48.8 million in\nimpairment of long-lived assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were no other intangible asset\nimpairments recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\nIn addition, the Company reassessed useful lives of the intangible assets included in the MSO asset group, and accelerated amortization\nof $14.8 million will be recorded prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life of six months.\nAmortization expense totaled $5.2 million and $10.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $5.7\nmillion and $11.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLeasehold improvements $ 19,691 $ 19,200\nVehicles 2,614 2,892\nFurniture and equipment 11,747 12,765\nSoftware 3,634 3,865\nAssets under finance leases (1) — 18,552\nConstruction in progress — 5,074\nTotal 37,686 62,349\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (2) (16,267) (14,431)\nTotal Property and equipment, net $ 21,419 $ 47,918\n(1) Refer to Note 12, Leases, for information.\n(2) Includes accumulated amortization related to finance ROU assets of $1.1 million, $0.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nConstruction in progress primarily consists of leasehold improvements at the Company’s centers, which have not opened.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed a review of its underperforming centers and abandoned certain\nleased properties. This served as a triggering event for assessment for impairment of the Company’s long-lived asset groups. Refer to\nNote 1, Description of Business and Going Concern, for further information.\nRecoverability of the asset groups was evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset groups to their estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows. The carrying amount exceeded undiscounted future cash flows and, based on further assessment, an impairment\ncharge was recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the underlying long-lived assets exceeded their fair value,\nwhich was estimated using the cost recovery method.\nIn addition, the Company reassessed useful lives of its property and equipment held at the centers which the Company will cease using\nsubsequent to June 30, 2024, and adjusted the estimated useful lives to align with the remaining useful life of the\n(12)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\ncorresponding ROU asset where such assets were utilized. Accordingly, accelerated depreciation of $3.4 million will be recorded\nprospectively over the estimated remaining useful life of six months.\nAs a result of these analyses, the Company recorded non-lease related property and equipment impairment charges of $7.1 million and\nfinance lease abandonment charges of $18.1 million both within impairments of long-lived assets in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. There were no property and equipment impairments or lease\nabandonments recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\nDepreciation expense, including amortization related to finance lease ROU assets, totaled $1.4 million and $2.9 million for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.2 million and $2.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\nNOTE 7. DEBT AND RELATED PARTY DEBT\nCredit Agreement\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provided for an aggregate of up to $300.0\nmillion in term loans, comprised of (i) initial term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $190.0 million (the “Initial Term Loans”)\nand (ii) a delayed term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loans”). The Credit\nAgreement permits the Company to enter into certain incremental facilities subject to compliance with the terms, conditions and\ncovenants set forth therein. In May 2022, the Company drew $190.0 million of the Initial Term Loans and used approximately $121\nmillion of the net proceeds from this borrowing to repay its outstanding obligations under the credit agreement dated June 8, 2021, as\namended and recognized related debt extinguishment losses of $6.2 million.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur\nadditional indebtedness, liens or encumbrances, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions or sell certain\nassets, to make certain restricted payments or pay dividends, to enter into consolidations, to transact with affiliates and to amend certain\nagreements, subject in each case to the exceptions and other qualifications as provided in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement\nalso contains covenants that require the Company to satisfy a minimum liquidity requirement of $50.0 million, which may be decreased\nto $25.0 million if the Company achieves a certain adjusted EBITDA, and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio based on the\nCompany’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with de novo losses excluded from the calculation of such ratio\nfor up to 36 months after the opening of a de novo center, which maximum total leverage ratio was initially 8.50 to 1.00, commencing\nwith the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 and is subject to a series of step-downs. For the fiscal quarters ending September 30,\n2026 and thereafter the Company must maintain a maximum total leverage ratio no greater than 5.50 to 1.00.\nThe Credit Agreement contains embedded derivatives related to optional and mandatory prepayments, default interest and the impact of\npotential legislative changes. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract, and are carried at fair value when: (a) the\nembedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the\nhost contract; and (b) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument. The Company\nhas concluded that mandatory prepayment and default interest features within the Credit Agreement meet these criteria and, as such, are\nvalued separately and apart from the Credit Agreement and are recorded at fair value each reporting period. The value of such\nbifurcated derivatives was $0 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reflected in\nthe Change in fair value of derivative liabilities within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and the fair value of the\nderivatives as of June 30, 2024 is reflected in other current liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note\n10, Fair Value Measurements, for information about the valuation of the embedded derivatives.\nOn March 8, 2023 (the “Amendment Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to\nthe Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) provide for a new\nincremental delayed draw term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan B\nFacility”); (ii) revise the commitment expiration date for the Company’s existing $110.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan to forty-five\ndays following the Amendment Closing Date; (iii) extend the commencement of amortization payments on loans under the Credit\nAgreement from March 31, 2024 to May 31, 2025; (iv) reduce the amount of interest that the Company may elect to capitalize from\n4.00% to 3.50% beginning on the second anniversary of the execution date of the Credit Agreement, 3.00% beginning on the third\nanniversary of the execution date of the Credit Agreement, and 1.50% beginning on December 10, 2025; (v) increase the amount of the\nsuper-priority revolving credit facility that is permitted\n(13)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nto be added to the Credit Agreement to $45.0 million and provide that the entirety of such facility may be used for general corporate\npurposes; and (vi) amend the prepayment provisions of the Credit Agreement, including to have such provisions run as of the\nAmendment Closing Date.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Waiver and Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”). The\nThird Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) waive certain events of default under the Credit\nAgreement in the limited manner set forth therein through May 15, 2024 (the “Third Amendment Specified Period”), subject to an\nearlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events, (ii) increase the applicable margin rate by 2.00%\nduring the Third Amendment Specified Period, which additional interest the Company may elect to capitalize as principal amount on\nthe outstanding loans and (iii) modify certain covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, including, but not limited to, reducing the\nminimum liquidity requirement to $10 million during the Third Amendment Specified Period and providing for additional reporting to\nthe lenders.\nOn May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Fourth\nAmendment”). The Fourth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the waiver of certain events of\ndefault under the Credit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 17, 2024 (the “Temporary Waiver Period”),\nsubject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Fifth\nAmendment”). The Fifth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the Credit\nAgreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 24, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Sixth\nAmendment”). The Sixth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the Credit\nAgreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 28, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 28, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Seventh\nAmendment”). The Seventh Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the\nCredit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through July 8, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nRefer to Note 16, Subsequent Events, for information about the Extended Seventh and the Eighth Amendments the Company entered\ninto in July 2024.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company drew $0 and $65.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loans,\nrespectively.\nBased on the elections made by the Company, as of June 30, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest of Term SOFR\n(calculated as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website, plus the applicable\ncredit spread adjustment based on the elected interest period), plus an applicable margin rate of 11.00%. As permitted under the Credit\nAgreement, as amended, the Company elected to capitalize the full amount of interest as principal from March 15, 2024 through August\n15, 2024. As a result of this election, the cash interest component of the applicable margin increased by 2.00%.\nLoan and Security Agreement - Related Party Debt\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”), by and among\nSparta Merger Sub I Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Sparta Merger Sub II Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Sparta Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger LLC I”), Sparta Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (together with Merger LLC I, the “Guarantors”), Steward Accountable Care Network, Inc.\n(n/k/a as Steward Accountable Care Network, LLC) and Steward National Care Network, Inc. (n/k/a Steward National Care Network,\nLLC), as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), CAJ Lending LLC (“CAJ”) and Deerfield Partners L.P., as lenders (the “Lenders”), and CAJ, as\nadministrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”). Mr. Carlos A. de Solo, a director of the Company and the\nCompany’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.\n(14)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nAlberto de Solo, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Joseph N. De Vera, the Company’s\nSenior Vice President and Legal Counsel, have interests in CAJ.\nPursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders provided the Borrowers a term loan (the “Term Loan”) in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $35.5 million. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan to fund the payment for the estimated value of the\naccounts receivable attributable to Medicare value-based payments for the period between January 1, 2022 and the closing of the\nSteward Acquisition, minus the amount of such payments payable to the affiliate physicians of the acquired Steward entities (the\n“Financed Net Pre-Closing Medicare AR”).\nThe Term Loan bore fixed interest at a rate of 12.0% per annum. In addition, the Borrowers paid a facility fee equal to 3.0% of the\naggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, which was accounted for as a debt discount. Any additional interest (if applicable)\naccrued and owing during the term of the Loan and Security Agreement was paid-in-kind and capitalized to principal monthly in\narrears. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into in connection with the Steward Acquisition (the “Merger\nAgreement”), Sparta Holding Co. LLC agreed to pay the costs of financing the Financed Net Pre-Closing Medicare AR and, at the\nclosing of the Steward Acquisition, paid to the Borrowers $6.8 million, representing all scheduled payments of interest and fees from\nthe Steward Acquisition closing date up to and including November 30, 2023, which amount was then paid in advance by the\nBorrowers to the Lenders.\nIn October 2023, the Company paid off all outstanding indebtedness of $35.5 million due under the Loan and Security Agreement with\nthe proceeds of the MSSP payment from the federal government, and the Loan and Security Agreement was terminated.\nElevance Health\nIn October 2022, in connection with the collaboration agreement with Elevance Health (formerly known as Anthem) the Company\nentered into a promissory note for $1.0 million due in October 2032. This borrowing bears a fixed interest rate of 6.25% per annum.\nFinance Leases\nRefer to Note 12, Leases, for information about the Company’s finance leases.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIndebtedness under the Credit Agreement, weighted-average interest rate of\n15.2% during the six months ended June 30, 2024. $ 399,295 $ 377,340\nFinance lease obligations, interest averaging 13.5% and maturing at various\ndates through 2043 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 15,148 19,612\nOther 2,189 2,220\nLess: Unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs (11,528) (13,349)\n405,105 385,823\nLess: Current portion (403,321) (364,380)\nLong-term portion $ 1,785 $ 21,443\nFuture maturities of the indebtedness outstanding at June 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Amount\nRemainder of 2024 $ 214\n2025 3,700\n2026 4,333\n2027 392,309\n2028 769\nThereafter 160\nTotal $ 401,485\nIn the table above, the future maturities are presented consistent with the contractual terms. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance\nwith all of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended through the Seventh Amendment; however, without an\nadditional waiver, we do not expect to be in compliance during the subsequent quarterly testing dates. A breach of any of the covenants\nunder the Credit Agreement or the occurrence of other events specified in the Credit Agreement\n(15)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\ncould result in an event of default under the same and give rise to the lenders’ right to accelerate our debt obligations thereunder and\npursue other remedial actions under such agreement and/or trigger a cross default under our long-term leases. Accordingly, as of June\n30, 2024, the full balance of the outstanding indebtedness related to the Credit Agreement was classified as a current liability in our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet.\nRefer to Note 1, Description of Business and Going Concern, for going concern considerations.\nNOTE 8. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company’s 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) permits the grant of equity-based awards to officers, directors,\nemployees and other service providers.

Inherent in a\nMonte Carlo simulation are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend\nyield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility of select peer companies that matches the\nexpected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant\ndate for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent\nto their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized loss of less than $0.1 million related to the change in\nthe fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized a\nbenefit of $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities.\nCredit Agreement Embedded Derivatives\nFair value of the embedded derivatives contained in the Credit Agreement is estimated using the discounted cash flow model. This\ninvolves significant Level 3 inputs and assumptions including the probability of occurrence of the respective triggering events and our\nrisk-adjusted discount rate. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a benefit of $2.4 million\nand $0, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of the Credit Agreement embedded\n(17)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nderivatives. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized $0 in both periods related to the change in\nthe fair value of the Credit Agreement embedded derivatives.

LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating and finance lease agreements for centers and office space expiring at various times through\n2043, inclusive of renewal options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.

The Company ceased rent payments for these properties, which in most cases constituted\nevents of default under the related lease agreements. Upon an event of default, remedies available to our landlords generally include,\nwithout limitation, terminating such lease agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable\nfor all obligations under such lease agreement, including the difference between the rent under such lease agreement and the rent\npayable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the rent due for the balance of the term of such lease\nagreement, less proceeds from re-letting, if any. As a result of these defaults,\n(20)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nas of June 30, 2024, operating lease liabilities of $34.5 million were reclassified to current portion of operating lease liabilities, and\nfinance lease liabilities of $19.9 million were reclassified to current portion of third-party debt, net, in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nIn addition to the leases abandoned as of June 30, 2024, and as further explained in Note 1, Description of Business and Going\nConcern, the Company decided to cease use of additional leased properties following June 30, 2024. These leases were considered in\nthe long-lived asset impairment analyses, as well as through the Company assessing the remaining useful lives of these assets, as\nfurther described in Note 1, Description of Business and Going Concern. The Company recognized $59.0 million and $18.1 million of\nabandonment charges on operating and finance right-of-use assets, respectively, abandoned as of June 30, 2024, in impairment of long-\nlived assets in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, the Company identified certain additional operating leased properties, which it plans to abandon after June 30, 2024, and\nfor which no impairment was recorded. The Company reassessed remaining useful lives for these properties and the related accelerated\namortization of $13.1 million will be recorded prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life of six months.\nOther information related to lease agreements was as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 11.7 11.7\nFinance leases 18.8 19.3\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 8.79% 8.16%\nFinance leases 13.46% 13.46%\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of liabilities (in thousands)\nOperating cash flows for operating leases 5,028 12,605\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 1,317 1,310\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company was party to leases that have not yet commenced with aggregated estimated future lease payments of\napproximately $24.8 million, which are not reflected in the above tables.\nThe Company’s finance leases, two of the operating leases, and one lease that has not yet commenced, contain various covenants, that\nrequire the Company, among other things, to maintain minimum consolidated stockholder's equity of $100.0 million and a minimum\ncash balance of $25.0 million. In addition, these leases are subject to provisions that provide for a cross default in the event any of\ncovenant violations under the Company’s Credit Agreement or in the event that covenant violations occur in other lease agreements\nwith the same landlord.\nNOTE 13. INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense was $0.2 million and $0.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively and $0.2\nmillion and $0.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was (0.1)% and\n(0.2)%, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and (0.6)% and (0.3)% during the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023, respectively, based on the assessment of a full valuation allowance, excluding a portion attributable to the “naked\ncredit” deferred tax liability.\n(21)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCompliance\nThe health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. These laws and\nregulations include, but are not limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government healthcare program participation\nrequirements, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Recently, government activity has\nincreased with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse statutes and regulations by\nhealthcare providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs together\nwith imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services billed. Compliance with these\nlaws and regulations, specifically those related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, can be subject to government review and\ninterpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown and not yet asserted at this time. Management believes that the Company is in\nsubstantial compliance with current laws and regulations.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal actions, demands, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and\naudits, and other legal matters arising in the normal course of business. Except as described below, management has not identified any\nlegal actions during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 or 2023 that were deemed to be material.\nAs described above in Note 12, Leases, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company failed to make rent\npayments due pursuant to certain of its center leases on centers that the Company generally does not intend to operate, which resulted in\nan event of default under the terms of the related lease agreements. Landlords of certain of the Company’s leased centers for which the\nCompany failed to pay rent have filed lawsuits against the Company for default on the lease payments. During the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024, total lease liabilities related to such leases were classified as a current liability in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nNOTE 15. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe Company has Administrative Service Agreements (the “ASAs”) with Medical Care of NY, P.C., Medical Care of Tennessee, PLLC\nand Medical Care of Texas, PLLC (together, the “PCs”), which were established to employ healthcare providers to deliver healthcare\nservices to patients in New York, Tennessee, and Texas, and with Care Optical, LLC (“Care Optical”), which provides optometry\nservices in the state of Florida. The Company concluded that it has variable interest in the PCs and Care Optical on the basis of its\nASAs which provide for a management fee payable to the Company from the PCs and Care Optical in exchange for providing\nmanagement and administrative services which creates risk and a potential return to the Company. The PCs’ and Care Optical’s equity\nat risk, as defined by GAAP, is insufficient to finance their activities without additional support, and therefore, the PCs and Care\nOptical are considered to be VIEs.\nIn order to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the PCs and Care Optical, and, thus, is the PCs’ and\nCare Optical’s primary beneficiary, the Company considered whether it has (i) the power to direct the activities of PCs and Care Optical\nthat most significantly impacts their economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the PCs and Care Optical or the\nright to receive benefits from the PCs and Care Optical that could potentially be significant to them. The Company concluded that the\nmember and employees of the PCs and Care Optical have no individual power to direct activities of the PCs and Care Optical that most\nsignificantly impact their economic performance. Under the ASAs, the Company is responsible for providing services that impact the\ngrowth of the patient population of the PCs and Care Optical, the management of the respective population’s healthcare needs, the\nprovision of required healthcare services to those patients, and the PCs’ and Care Optical’s ability to receive revenue from health plans.\nIn addition, the Company’s variable interest in the PCs and Care Optical provides the Company with the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to them. The single members of the PCs and Care Optical are employees of the Company. Based on this\nanalysis, the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the PCs and Care Optical and therefore consolidates the balance\nsheet, results of operations and cash flow of the PCs and Care Optical.\nFurthermore, as a direct result of nominal initial equity contributions by the single members of the PCs and Care Optical, the financial\nsupport CareMax provides to the PCs and Care Optical (e.g. loans) and the provisions of the arrangements described above, the interest\nheld by the single member lacks economic substance and does not provide the member with the ability to\n(22)\nCAREMAX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nparticipate in the residual profits or losses generated by the PCs and Care Optical. Therefore, all income and expenses recognized by\nthe PCs and Care Optical are allocated to CareMax.\nThe following tables summarize the financial position and operations of the PCs and Care Optical (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal assets $ 1,032 $ 1,200\nTotal liabilities $ 12,092 $ 9,896\nThree Months Ended June Six Months Ended June 30, Three Months Ended June Six Months Ended June 30,\n30, 2024 2024 30, 2023 2023\nRevenue $ 1,101 $ 1,975 $ 580 $ 997\nOperating expenses $ 1,975 $ 3,702 $ 1,977 $ 3,691\nNOTE 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn July 8, 2024, the Company entered into an Extended Limited Waiver and Seventh Amendment to the certain Credit Agreement (the\n“Extended Seventh Amendment”). The Extended Seventh Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain\nevents of default under the Credit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through July 10, 2024, subject to an earlier\ntermination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nOn July 10, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Eighth\nAmendment”). The Eighth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, provide for a new $4.0 million term\nloan (the “Eighth Amendment Term Loan”), funded at the closing of the Eighth Amendment, and a new incremental delayed draw term\nloan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million, funded at the discretion of the Lenders (the loans thereunder, “Delayed\nDraw Term Loans” and, together with the Eighth Amendment Term Loan, the “Eighth Amendment Loans”). The Eighth Amendment\nLoans are to be repaid prior to all other loans previously made under the Credit Agreement and will mature on the earlier of April 10,\n2025 and the occurrence of certain liquidity events. The Eighth Amendment Loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to Term\nSOFR plus 13.00% and a fee of 6.50% per annum will accrue on the unused portion of the commitments, which interest and fee will\neach be payable by capitalizing and adding such amount to the outstanding balance of the Eighth Amendment Loans. The Lenders\nreceived an upfront fee of 3% of the total amount of commitments upon entry into the Eighth Amendment, which fee was capitalized\nand added to the outstanding balance of the Eighth Amendment Loans, and will earn an additional fee upon repayment or other\nsatisfaction of the Eighth Amendment Loans such that the minimum total cash return to the Lenders on amounts funded will equal\n130%. The Eighth Amendment requires that the Company continue to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity and operate within a\nmaximum variance to budget and that the Company use the net cash proceeds of any account receivables attributable to the Medicare\nShared Savings Program to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Eighth Amendment also extended the waiver\nof certain events of default under the Credit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through August 15, 2024, subject to an\nearlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\n(23)\nItem 2.

New factors may emerge, and it is not possible to predict all\nfactors that may affect our business and prospects.\nOur Business\nAs of June 30, 2024, CareMax operated 50 centers in Florida, New York, and Tennessee. CareMax offers a comprehensive range of\nmedical services, including primary and preventative care, specialist services, diagnostic testing, chronic disease management and\ndental and optometry services under global capitation contracts.\nCareMax’s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery is powered by its CareOptimize technology platform.\nCareOptimize is a purpose-built end-to-end technology platform that aggregates data and analyzes that data using proprietary\nalgorithms and machine learning to support more informed care delivery decisions and to focus care decisions on preventative chronic\ndisease management and the social determinants of health. CareMax believes that CareOptimize is designed to drive better outcomes\nand lower costs. CareMax has shifted from selling the CareOptimize platform to new outside customers for a software subscription fee\nand is instead focused on providing the software to affiliated practices of its managed services organization (“MSO”) to further improve\nfinancial, clinical and quality outcomes from the affiliated providers.\nCareMax’s centers offer 24/7 access to care through employed providers and provide a comprehensive suite of high-touch health care\nand social services to its patients, including primary care, specialty care, telemedicine, health & wellness, optometry, dental, pharmacy\nand transportation. CareMax’s differentiated healthcare delivery model is focused on care coordination with vertically integrated\nambulatory care and community-centric services. The goal of CareMax is to intercede as early as possible to manage chronic conditions\nfor its patient members in a proactive, holistic, and tailored manner to provide a positive influence on patient outcomes and a reduction\nin overall healthcare costs. CareMax focuses on providing access to high quality care in underserved communities.\nWhile CareMax’s primary focus is providing care to Medicare eligible seniors who are mostly 65+ (approximately 83% and 78% of\nrevenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, came from these patients), we also provide services to children\nand adults through Medicaid programs as well as through commercial insurance plans. Substantially all of the Medicare patients cared\nfor in CareMax’s centers are enrolled in MA plans which are run by private insurance companies and are approved by and under\ncontract with Medicare. With MA, patients get all of the same coverage as original Medicare, including emergency care, and most plans\nalso include prescription drug coverage. In many cases, MA plans offer more benefits than original Medicare, including dental, vision,\nhearing and wellness programs. We contract with nearly all national and most regional, local Medicare Advantage plans.\nIn addition to Medicare Advantage contracts, through our MSO we service other Medicare patients through a variety of value-based\ncontracts, such as Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) and ACO REACH.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn January 31, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s\nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every thirty shares of\nthe Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date automatically converted into one share of Class A Common\nStock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, stockholders of record\nwho otherwise would have been entitled to receive fractional shares were entitled to\n(26)\nrounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted, based on\na 1-for-30 split ratio, all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, as well as the terms of warrants outstanding at\nthe time of the effectiveness of the Reverse Split. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and the number\nof shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. There was no\nchange in the par value of our common stock or preferred stock.\nReferences to number of shares of Class A Common Stock and per share data (except par value) in the accompanying financial\nstatements and notes thereto for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.\nSteward Health Care Restructuring\nOn May 6, 2024, Steward Health Care System and certain of its affiliates commenced an in-court restructuring process through the\nfiling of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Texas. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into certain agreements with affiliates of Steward Health Care System\nin connection with the Steward Acquisition. In June 2024, as part of these bankruptcy proceedings, Steward Health Care System moved\nto reject certain of such contracts. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Going Concern, in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Report for further information.\nLong-lived Asset Impairments\nThe Company reviews recoverability of its long-lived assets, including other intangible assets, property and equipment, and right-of-use\nassets, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. During the three months\nended June 30, 2024, the Company performed an impairment assessment of its asset groups. The impairment assessment was triggered\nby the rejection by Steward Health Care System of certain contracts, as further explained in Steward Health Care Restructuring above.\nThe impairment assessment was also triggered by the Company’s abandonment of a number of leased properties during the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and a decision to cease use of additional leased properties following June 30, 2024.\nBased on the results of these events and the impairment assessments, the Company recognized impairments of long-lived assets of\n$133.0 million, consisting of:\n• Property and equipment impairments and finance right-of-use asset abandonments of $25.2 million (Refer to Note 6,\nProperty and Equipment, in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further\ninformation);\n• Operating right-of-use asset abandonments of $59.0 million (Refer to Note 12, Leases, in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Report for further information); and\n• Other intangible asset impairments of $48.8 million (Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further information).\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur Patients\nAs discussed above, the Company partners with Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance plans. While CareMax currently\nservices mostly Medicare patients, we also accept Medicare fee-for-service patients.\nJun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31,\nPatient Count as of* Jun 30, 2024\n2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024\nMedicare Advantage 37,000 39,500 93,500 95,500 102,500 107,000 111,500 107,000 104,000\nMedicare Government VBC — — 109,500 107,000 101,000 99,500 97,500 95,000 94,000\nMedicaid 29,500 31,500 33,500 33,500 30,500 28,500 25,500 31,000 22,000\nCommercial 21,500 22,000 22,000 34,500 38,500 38,000 36,000 17,000 16,500\nTotal Count 88,000 93,000 258,500 271,000 272,500 273,000 270,000 250,000 236,500\n* Figures may not sum due to rounding\nBecause CareMax accepts multiple insurance types, it uses a Medicare-Equivalent Member (“MCREM”) value in reviewing key factors\nof its performance. To determine the Medicare-Equivalent, CareMax estimates the amount of support typically\n(27)\nreceived by one Medicare patient as equivalent to the level of support received by three Medicaid or Commercial patients. This is due\nto Medicare patients on average having significantly higher levels of chronic and acute conditions that need higher levels of care. Due\nto this dynamic, a 3:1 ratio is applied to make year over year comparisons of total membership more comparable. The breakdown of\nmembership for MCREM is below:\nJun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30,\nMCREM Count as of* Jun 30, 2023\n2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024\nMedicare Advantage 37,000 39,500 93,500 95,500 102,500 107,000 111,500 107,000 104,000\nMedicare Government VBC — — 109,500 107,000 101,000 99,500 97,500 95,000 94,000\nMedicaid 9,900 10,600 11,100 11,200 10,100 9,500 8,400 10,300 7,400\nCommercial 7,100 7,300 7,400 11,400 12,900 12,700 11,900 5,700 5,500\nTotal Count 54,000 57,400 221,500 225,100 226,500 228,700 229,300 218,000 210,900\n* Figures may not sum due to rounding\nMedicare Advantage Patients\nAs of June 30, 2024, CareMax had approximately 104,000 MA patients of which 99% were in value-based agreements. Approximately\n37% of patients in the Medicare Advantage value-based care agreements were in full-risk contracts. This means CareMax has been\nselected as the patient’s primary care provider and is financially responsible for some or all of the patient’s medical costs. CareMax is\nattributed an agreed percentage of the premium the Medicare plan receives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n(“CMS”) (typically a substantial majority of such premium given the risk assumed by the Company). A reconciliation is performed\nperiodically and if premiums exceed medical costs paid by the MA plan, CareMax receives payment from the Medicare plan. If medical\ncosts paid by the Medicare plan exceed premiums, CareMax is responsible to reimburse the Medicare plan.\nMedicare Government Value-Based Care (“VBC”) Programs\nAs of June 30, 2024, CareMax had approximately 94,000 patients enrolled in Medicare Government VBC Programs, of which\napproximately 92% were in the MSSP and 8% were in the ACO REACH program. The MSSP is sponsored by the CMS. The MSSP\nallows participating Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) to receive a share of cost savings they generate in connection with the\nmanagement of costs and quality of medical services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. Payments to the ACO participants, if any, are\ncalculated annually and paid once a year by CMS on cost savings generated by the ACO participant relative to the ACO participants’\nCMS benchmark. Under the MSSP, the ACO must meet certain qualifications to receive the full amount of its allocable cost savings or\nthey either receive nothing or are responsible for shared losses. The MSSP rules require CMS to develop a benchmark for savings to be\nachieved by each participant if the participant is to receive shared savings. An ACO that meets the MSSP’s quality performance\nstandards will be eligible to receive a share of the savings to the extent its assigned beneficiary medical expenditures are below the\nmedical expenditure benchmark provided by CMS. A Minimum Savings Rate (“MSR”), which varies depending on the number of\nbeneficiaries assigned to the ACO, must be achieved before the ACO can receive up to a 75% share of the savings if quality\nperformance standards are met; the ACO is also responsible for 40% of the deficit. Once the MSR is surpassed, all the savings below\nthe benchmark provided by CMS will be shared with the ACO.\nMedicaid Patients\nAs of June 30, 2024, CareMax had approximately 22,000 Medicaid patients of which 100% were in value-based agreements.\nApproximately 91% of patients in the Medicaid value-based care agreements were in full-risk contracts. Using the MCREM metric, the\nlevel of support required to manage these Medicaid patients equates to that of approximately 7,400 Medicare patients. In Florida, most\nMedicaid recipients are enrolled in the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program.\nSimilar to the risk it takes with Medicare, CareMax is attributed an agreed percentage of the premium the Medicaid plan receives from\nFlorida’s Agency for Health Care Administration (“AHCA”) (typically a substantial majority of such premium given the risk assumed\nby the Company). A reconciliation is performed periodically and if premiums exceed medical costs paid by the Medicaid plan,\nCareMax receives payment from the Medicaid plan. If medical costs paid by the Medicaid plan exceed premiums, we are responsible to\nreimburse the Medicaid plan.\n(28)\nCommercial Patients\nAs of June 30, 2024, CareMax managed approximately 16,500 commercial patients of which 100% were under a value-based\nagreement that provided upside-only financial incentives for quality and utilization performance. Using the MCREM metric, the level\nof support required to manage these commercial patients equates to that of approximately 5,500 Medicare patients.\nCareMax cares for a number of commercial patients (less than 1% of the Company's total patients) for whom it is reimbursed on a fee-\nfor-service basis via their health plan in situations where it does not have a capitation relationship with that particular health plan.\nCareMax fee for-service revenue, received directly from commercial plans, on a per patient basis is typically lower than its per patient\nrevenue for at-risk patients based in part because its fee-for-service revenue covers only the primary care services that it directly\nprovides to the patient, while the risk revenue is intended to compensate it for the services directly performed by CareMax as well as\nthe financial risk that it assumes related to the third-party medical expenses of at-risk patients.\nContracts with Payors\nOur economic model relies on its capitated partnerships with payors which manage and market Medicare plans across the United\nStates. CareMax has established strategic value-based relationships with a number of different payors for Medicare Advantage patients,\nMedicaid patients, and ACA patients. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, our three largest payor relationships were Payor A,\nPayor C, and Payor B, which generated 20%, 19%, and 14%, of our revenue, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2023,\nour three largest payor relationships were Payor A, Payor C and Payor E, which generated 26%, 22% and 16% of our revenue,\nrespectively. These existing contracts and relationships with our national partners and their understanding of the value of the CareMax\nmodel reduces the risk of entering into new markets as CareMax typically seeks to have payor contracts in place before entering a new\nmarket. Maintaining, supporting, and growing these relationships, particularly as CareMax enters new markets, are critical to our long-\nterm success. We believe CareMax’s model is well-aligned with that of its payor partners - to drive better health outcomes for their\npatients, enhance patient satisfaction, and drive incremental patient and revenue growth. This alignment of interests helps ensure our\ncontinued success with our payor partners.\nEffectively Manage the Cost of Care for Our Patients\nThe capitated nature of our contracting with payors requires us to prudently manage the medical expense of our patients. Our external\nprovider costs are our largest expense category, representing 55% of our total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 and 53% of our total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Our care model focuses on leveraging the\nprimary care setting as a means of avoiding costly downstream healthcare costs, such as acute hospital admissions. Our patients retain\nthe freedom to seek care at emergency rooms or hospitals; we do not restrict their access to care. Therefore, we could be liable for\npotentially large medical claims should we not effectively manage our patients’ health. We utilize stop-loss insurance for our patients,\nprotecting us from medical claims in excess of certain levels.\nSeasonality to our Business\nDue to the large number of dual-eligible patients (meaning eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) we serve, the annual enrollment\nperiod does not materially affect our growth during the year. We typically see large increases in ACA patients during the first quarter as\na result of the ACA annual enrollment period (October to December). However, this is not a large portion of our business.\nOur operational and financial results will experience some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. This\nvariability is most notable in the following areas:\nPer-Patient Revenue\nThe revenue derived from our at-risk patients is a function of the percentage of premium we have negotiated with our payor partners, as\nwell as our ability to accurately and appropriately document the acuity of a patient. We experience some seasonality with respect to our\nper-patient revenue, as it will generally decline over the course of the year. In January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment\nfactor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to changes in per-patient revenue. As the year\nprogresses, our per-patient revenue declines as new patients join us, typically with less\n(29)\ncomplete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores), and patient mortality disproportionately impacts our\nhigher-risk (and therefore greater revenue) patients.\nExternal Provider Costs\nExternal Provider Costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses,\nsuch as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which can result in an increase in medical expenses\nduring these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-patient medical costs in the first and fourth quarters.\nMedical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period. Shorter periods will have lesser medical costs due to fewer\nbusiness days. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days\ncompared to another. We would also expect to experience an impact in the future should there be another pandemic such as COVID-19,\nwhich may result in increased or decreased total medical costs depending upon the severity of the infection, the duration of the\ninfection and the impact to the supply and availability of healthcare services for our patients.\nPayor Settlements\nAs it relates to our MSSP contracts, settlements from the prior year from the CMS typically take place during the fourth quarter of each\nyear, which results in variability of our accounts receivable, cash flow from operations, and cash balances throughout the year.\nInvestments in Centers\nWe have invested into de novo centers both within and outside of Florida. De novo centers require upfront capital and operating\nexpenditures, which typically are not fully offset by revenues in the near-term, as a result of which we expect a period of unprofitability\nin our de novo centers before they break even. Costs we incur prior to opening of a de novo center include (1) incremental payroll costs\nfrom employees specifically associated with the operational, contractual, physical, or regulatory infrastructure for de novo centers, prior\nto their opening; (2) legal costs directly associated with the de novo centers, incurred prior to their opening, which includes services\nsuch as execution of leases, health plan contracts and other agreements; (3) other expenses related to diligence, design, permitting, and\nother “soft costs” at new sites; and (4) rent and facility expenses prior to center opening. Once a de novo center opens, we incur post-\nopening losses, which consist of center-level operating losses recognized at a de novo center until the center breaks even. The de novo\npost-opening losses consist of revenue, external provider costs and cost of care allocated to the de novo center. During the six months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred de novo pre-opening costs and post-opening losses, on a combined basis, of $9.4 million\nand $11.6 million, respectively.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to our financial information which conforms with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”), management reviews a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate its\nbusiness, measure its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nCertain financial information and data contained in this Report is unaudited and does not conform to Regulation S-X. Accordingly, such\ninformation and data may not be included in, may be adjusted in, or may be presented differently in, any periodic filing, information or\nproxy statement, or prospectus or registration statement to be filed by the Company with the SEC. Some of the financial information\nand data contained in this Report, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Platform Contribution have not been prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. These non-GAAP measures of financial results are not GAAP measures of our financial results or liquidity and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial results, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of\nliquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures of\nfinancial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the\nCompany’s financial condition and results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for trend analyses and for\nbudgeting and planning purposes.\n(30)\nThe Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating\nprojected operating results and trends in and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of\nwhich present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in\nisolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s\nfinancial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about\nwhich expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for\nthese limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. You should review the\nCompany’s GAAP financial statements, which are included in this Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nBeginning with the Company’s Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2023, for all periods presented, the Company updated\nits calculation of the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA on a retrospective basis to no longer add back certain compensation costs for\nstay-on bonuses and duplicative salaries previously included within the Business Combination integration costs adjustment.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived\nassets, remeasurement of derivative and contingent earnout liabilities, goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation, Business\nCombination integration costs, acquisition and disposition related costs, income tax expense, and other income or expenses that are\nconsidered one-time in nature as determined by management.\nAdjusted EBITDA is intended to be used as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in\naccordance with GAAP. Management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measure with those of comparable companies, which\nmay present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded\nwhen calculating these measures. In addition, our presentations of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our\nfuture results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to\nother similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same\nfashion. Due to these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Y/Y Change 2024 2023 Y/Y Change\nNet loss $ (170,558) $ (32,376) $ (138,181) $ (213,966) $ (114,458) $ (99,507)\nInterest expense 20,376 13,197 7,179 40,131 23,908 16,224\nDepreciation and amortization 6,512 6,828 (315) 13,218 13,404 (187)\nImpairment of long-lived assets 132,990 — 132,990 132,990 — 132,990\nRemeasurement of derivative and contingent\n(2,355) 15,786 (18,141) 26 (21,456) 21,482\nearnout liabilities\nGoodwill impairment — — — — 98,000 (98,000)\nStock-based compensation 2,396 2,464 (68) 4,761 4,762 (1)\nBusiness Combination integration costs (1) 399 686 (287) 780 1,402 (622)\nAcquisition and disposition related costs (2) (669) 815 (1,484) 383 1,436 (1,053)\nOther (3) (421) (535) 114 (312) (722) 410\nIncome tax expense 177 177 — 354 355 (1)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (11,152) $ 7,042 $ (18,194) $ (21,634) $ 6,630 $ (28,265)\n(1) Represents initial costs to set up public company processes, incremental vendor expenses identified as temporary or duplicative and expected to be\nrationalized in the short term, and legal and professional expenses outside of the ordinary course of business, which are being incurred as part of the\nCompany’s efforts as it integrates the two privately held companies that were combined in the Business Combination.

We define our total at-risk patients as patients who have selected us as their\nprovider of primary care medical services as of the end of a particular period and for whom we take responsibility for at least some\ndegree of downside risk in capitated contracts. An at-risk patient remains active in our system until we are informed by the health plan\nthe patient is no longer active. As discussed above, CareMax calculates the amount of support\n(32)\ntypically received by one Medicare patient as equivalent to the level of support received by three Medicaid or Commercial patients.\nPlatform Contribution\nWe define Platform Contribution as gross profit plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation recognized within cost\nof care and other adjustments, as disclosed below. Gross profit is defined as revenue less the sum of (i) external provider costs; (ii) cost\nof care, including stock-based compensation, and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. We believe this metric best reflects the\neconomics of our care model as it includes all medical claims expense associated with our patients’ care as well as the costs we incur to\ncare for our patients at our centers. As a center matures, we expect the Platform Contribution from that center to increase both in terms\nof absolute dollars as well as a percentage of revenue. This increase will be driven by improving patient contribution economics over\ntime, as well as our ability to generate operating leverage on the costs of our centers. Our aggregate Platform Contribution may not\nincrease despite improving economics at our existing centers should we open new centers at a pace that skews our mix of centers\ntowards newer centers.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to Platform\nContribution:\nThree Months Ended\nJun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30,\n(in millions) 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024\nGross profit (a) $ 15.4 $ 14.8 $ 17.2 $ 17.1 $ 20.4 $ 12.0 $ (63.5) $ 1.5 $ (3.6)\nDepreciation and amortization 4.9 4.6 7.2 6.6 6.8 6.8 7.6 6.7 6.5\nStock-based compensation 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.0 1.3 1.2 0.1 0.7 0.7\nOther adjustments (b) 0.1 0.1 — — — 1.0 0.2 0.2 0.1\nPlatform Contribution $ 21.6 $ 20.6 $ 25.6 $ 24.7 $ 28.6 $ 21.1 $ (55.6) $ 9.1 $ 3.7\n(a) Gross profit reflects the reclassification of stock-based compensation expense previously included in corporate, general and administrative expenses, which\ndecreased gross profit by $1.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022, $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $1.2 million\nduring the three months ended December 31, 2022.\n(b) Other adjustments include incremental costs related to post-Business Combination integration initiatives and other one-time center-level costs. During the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024, other adjustments include $1.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of\nseverance costs related to center staff.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMedicare Risk-Based Revenue and Medicaid Risk-Based Revenue. Our Medicare and Medicaid risk-based revenue consists primarily of\ncapitation fees for medical services provided by us or managed by our MSO under a global capitation arrangement made directly with\nvarious MA payors. Capitation is a fixed amount of money per patient per month paid in advance for the delivery of health care\nservices, whereby we are generally liable for medical costs in excess of the fixed payment and are able to retain any surplus created if\nmedical costs are less than the fixed payment. A portion of our capitated revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the\nnumber of MA patients selecting us as their primary care provider. Our capitated rates are determined as a percentage of the premium\nthe MA plan receives from CMS for our at-risk members. Those premiums are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS\nand are based upon the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the patients enrolled. Medicare pays\ncapitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient.\nPayors with higher acuity patients receive more in premium, and those with lower acuity patients receive less in premium. Under the\nrisk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in\nsubsequent periods after the final data is compiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model, our capitation payments\nwill correlate with how our payor partners’ premiums change with CMS. Risk adjustment in future periods may be impacted by\nCOVID-19 and our inability to accurately document the health needs of our patients, which may have an adverse impact on our\nrevenue.\nFor Medicaid, premiums are determined by Florida’s AHCA and base rates are adjusted annually using historical utilization data\nprojected forward by a third-party actuarial firm. The rates are established based on specific cohorts by age and sex and geographical\nlocation. AHCA uses a “zero sum” risk adjustment model that establishes acuity for certain cohorts of patients quarterly, and depending\non the scoring of that acuity, may periodically shift premiums from health plans with lower acuity members to health plans with higher\nacuity members.\n(33)\nGovernment Value-Based Care Revenue. Government value-based care revenue consists primarily of revenue derived from the MSSP.\nThe MSSP is sponsored by the CMS. The MSSP allows ACOs to receive a share in cost savings they generate in connection with the\nmanaging of costs and quality of medical services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. Payments to ACO participants, if any, are\ncalculated annually and paid once a year by CMS on cost savings generated by the ACO participant relative to the ACO participants’\nCMS benchmark. Under the MSSP, an ACO must meet certain qualifications to receive the full amount of its allocable cost savings or\nthey either receive nothing or are responsible for shared losses. The MSSP rules require CMS to develop a benchmark for savings to be\nachieved by each ACO if the ACO is to receive shared savings. An ACO that meets the MSSP’s quality performance standards will be\neligible to receive a share of the savings to the extent its assigned beneficiary medical expenditures are below the medical expenditure\nbenchmark provided by CMS. A Minimum Savings Rate (“MSR”) must be achieved before the ACO can receive a share of the savings.\nOnce the MSR is surpassed, all the savings below the benchmark provided by CMS will be shared at a certain percentage with the\nACO. The MSR varies depending on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the ACO.\nOther Revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of professional capitation payments and pharmacy revenue. These revenues are a\nfixed amount of money per patient per month paid in advance for the delivery of primary care services only, whereby CareMax is not\nliable for medical costs in excess of the fixed payment. Capitated revenues are typically paid monthly to CareMax based on the number\nof patients selecting us as their primary care provider. Our capitated rates are fixed, contractual rates. Incentive payments for Healthcare\nEffectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) and any services paid on a fee-for-service basis by a health plan are also included in\nother revenue. Other revenue also includes ancillary fees earned under contracts with certain payors for the provision of certain care\ncoordination and other care management services. These services are provided to patients covered by these payors regardless of\nwhether those patients receive their care from our affiliated medical groups. Revenue for primary care service for patients in partial risk\nor upside-only contracts, pharmacy revenue and revenue generated from CareOptimize are reported in other revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nExternal Provider Costs. External provider costs include services at-risk patients utilize that are rendered by providers other than\nCareMax. These include claims paid by the health plan and estimates for unpaid claims. The estimated reserve for incurred but not paid\nclaims is included as a reduction to accounts receivable as we do not pay medical claims. Actual claims expense will differ from the\nestimated liability due to differences in estimated and actual patient utilization of health care services, the amount of charges, and other\nfactors. We typically reconcile our medical claims expense with our payor partners on a monthly basis and adjust our estimate of\nincurred but not paid claims if necessary. To the extent we revise our estimates of incurred but not paid claims for prior periods up or\ndown, there would be a correspondingly favorable or unfavorable effect on our current period results that may or may not reflect\nchanges in long term trends in our performance. We expect our medical claims expenses to increase in both absolute dollar terms as\nwell as on a PMPM basis given the healthcare spending trends within the Medicare population and the increasing disease burden of\npatients as they age.\nThe Company re-evaluated key assumptions and estimates and based on this analysis, the Company identified changes in estimates to\nrevenue, external provider costs, short-term and long-term accounts receivable, net, and risk settlement liabilities. Accordingly, the\nCompany recognized the following changes in prior year estimates in each respective period (in thousands):\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nIncrease (decrease) 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 8,475 $ (22,964)\nExternal provider costs (12,231) (1,736)\nShort-term and long-term accounts receivable, net (926) (21,228)\nRisk settlement liabilities (21,631) —\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the decreases were mostly driven by favorable development in provider costs from Medicare\nfull risk plans, partially offset by unfavorable development in provider costs from Medicaid full risk plans primarily from 2022 dates of\nservice. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the developments related to the prior year dates of service were primarily driven by\nnew, updated information regarding MSO membership at one health plan, an unseasonably early flu season, and more current data from\none Medicaid health plan.\nCost of Care. Cost of care includes the costs of additional medical services we provide to patients that are not paid by the plan. These\nservices include patient transportation, medical supplies, auto insurance and other specialty costs, like dental or vision. In some\ninstances, we have negotiated better rates than the health plans for these health plan covered services. In addition, cost\n(34)\nof care includes rent, utilities and facilities costs required to maintain and operate our centers, and compensation of the clinic and\nsupport staff.\nCost of care also includes distributions to affiliate IPA physicians and physician groups. Expenses from our physician groups that\ncontract with our MSO are consolidated with other clinical and MSO expenses to determine profitability for our at-risk and fee-for-\nservice arrangements. Physician group economics are not evaluated on an individual provider basis, as MSO related medical expenses\nare consolidated at the contract level.\nWe measure the incremental cost of our capitation agreements by starting with our center-level expenses, which are calculated based\nupon actual expenses incurred at a specific center for a given period of time and expenses that are incurred centrally and allocated to\ncenters on a ratable basis. These expenses are allocated to our at-risk patients based upon the number of visit slots these patients utilized\ncompared to the total slots utilized by all of our patients. All visits, however, are not identical and do not require the same level of effort\nand expense on our part. Certain types of visits are more time and resource intensive and therefore result in higher expenses for services\nprovided internally. Generally, patients who are earlier in their tenure with CareMax utilize a higher percentage of these more intensive\nvisits, as we get to know the patient and properly assess and document such patient’s health condition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses represent employee-related expenses, such as salaries, commissions and\nrelated benefits, including stock-based compensation for sales and marketing departments. These expenses also include marketing and\ncommunity relations related costs, such as radio and television advertising, events and promotional items.\nCorporate, General and Administrative Expenses. Corporate, general, and administrative expenses represent employee-related\nexpenses, such as salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation for support functions like finance, legal, human\nresources, and business developments. In addition, these expenses include corporate technology, third party professional services and\ncorporate occupancy costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments\nand consist of fixed asset depreciation and amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Impairment of long-lived assets includes impairments of intangible assets and property and\nequipment and ROU assets.\nNonoperating Income (Expenses)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest payments, paid-in-kind interest, amortization of debt issuance costs and\ndebt discount on our outstanding borrowings.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. Change in fair value of derivative liabilities consists of changes in fair value of the\npublic warrants and private placement warrants and Credit Agreement embedded derivatives.\nGain (Loss) on Remeasurement of Contingent Earnout Liabilities. Gain (loss) on remeasurement of contingent earnout liabilities\nconsists of changes in the fair value of contingent earnout liabilities.\nOther Income (Expenses), Net. Other income (expenses), net, consists of miscellaneous non-operating corporate expenses and income.\n(35)\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenue\nMedicare risk-based revenue $ 154,857 $ 155,486 $ (629) (0.4%)\nMedicaid risk-based revenue 22,865 30,054 (7,189) (23.9%)\nGovernment value-based care revenue 14,690 22,206 (7,516) (33.8%)\nOther revenue 6,215 16,694 (10,479) (62.8%)\nTotal revenue 198,627 224,440 (25,814) (11.5%)\nOperating expenses\nExternal provider costs 153,115 156,995 (3,880) (2.5%)\nCost of care 42,593 40,192 2,400 6.0%\nSales and marketing 1,378 3,327 (1,949) (58.6%)\nCorporate, general and administrative 14,780 20,849 (6,069) (29.1%)\nDepreciation and amortization 6,512 6,828 (315) (4.6%)\nImpairment of long-lived assets 132,990 — 132,990 100.0%\nTotal costs and expenses 351,368 228,191 123,177 54.0%\nOperating loss (152,741) (3,750) (148,991) (3,972.6%)\nNonoperating (expenses) income\nInterest expense (20,376) (13,197) (7,179) (54.4%)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities 2,355 434 1,921 442.8%\nLoss on remeasurement of contingent earnout liabilities — (16,220) 16,220 100.0%\nOther income, net 382 534 (153) (28.6%)\nTotal nonoperating expenses (17,639) (28,449) 10,809 38.0%\nLoss before income tax (170,381) (32,199) (138,182) (429.1%)\nIncome tax expense (177) (177) — 0.0%\nNet loss $ (170,558) $ (32,376) $ (138,182) (426.8%)\n* Figures may not sum due to rounding\nMedicare risk-based revenue. Medicare risk-based revenue was $154.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of\n$0.6 million, or 0.4%, compared to $155.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The slight decrease was driven primarily\nby a 10.6% increase in the total number of at-risk Medicare patients and a favorable net prior period development of approximately\n$9.0 million, offset by a 9.9% decrease in rates.\nMedicaid risk-based revenue. Medicaid risk-based revenue was $22.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of\n$7.2 million, or 23.9%, compared to $30.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was driven primarily by a\n27.1% decrease in the total number of at-risk Medicaid patients, partially offset by a 4.4% increase in rates.\nGovernment value-based care revenue. Government value-based care revenue was $14.7 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2024, a decrease of $7.5 million, or 33.8%, compared to $22.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is the\nresult of lower estimated MSSP shared savings, as compared to prior year, as well as unfavorable prior period development from\nlowering estimates related to prior period accruals.\nOther revenue. Other revenue was $6.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $10.5 million, or 62.8%,\ncompared to $16.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in partial risk revenue,\nas risk contracts are converted to full risk, and lower revenue from incentive-based programs.\nExternal provider costs. External provider costs were $153.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.9\nmillion, or 2.5%, compared to $157.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The slight decrease was driven by a favorable\nnet prior period development of approximately $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in claim costs and a 2.5% increase in the total\nnumber of at-risk patients.\nCost of care. Cost of care expenses were $42.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $2.4 million, or 6.0%,\ncompared to $40.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n(36)\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of\n$1.9 million, or 58.6%, compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is due to a reduction in our\nsales staff and marketing efforts in 2024 as compared to 2023, related to our initiative to reduce operating expenses.\nCorporate, general and administrative expenses. Corporate, general and administrative expenses were $14.8 million for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 29.1%, compared to $20.8 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2023. The increase is primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses related to our initiative to reduce operating expenses, partially\noffset by higher advisory and legal fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $6.5 million for the three months ended June\n30, 2024, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 4.6%, compared to $6.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets was $133.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, which\nincluded impairment of intangible assets, ROU assets and property and equipment. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Going\nConcern, in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further information.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $20.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $7.2 million, or 54.4%,\ncompared to $13.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was due to the increased borrowings and higher\nweighted-average interest rate. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Related Party Debt, in our condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Report for additional information on the borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities. The Company recorded a gain on fair value of derivative liabilities of $2.4 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $1.9 million, or 442.8%, compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended June\n30, 2023. This increase was driven by the reduction in the fair value of the Credit Agreement embedded derivatives during the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024.\nLoss on remeasurement of contingent earnout liabilities. We recorded a loss on remeasurement of contingent earnout liabilities related\nto Steward Acquisition of $16.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by the increase in the market value of the\nCompany’s Class A Common Stock from March 31, 2023 to June 30, 2023. There was no activity during the three months ended June\n30, 2024 due to the contingent earnout consideration being reclassified into additional paid-in-capital as of June 30, 2023.\nOther income, net.

The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in partial risk revenue,\nas risk contracts are converted to full risk, and the impact of lower revenue from incentive based programs.\nExternal provider costs. External provider costs were $334.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $66.4\nmillion, or 24.8%, compared to $267.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by an\nincrease in claim costs and a 9.2% increase in the total number of at-risk patients, partially offset by the favorable net prior period\ndevelopment of $12.0 million. In addition, external provider costs recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023, were\nimpacted by unfavorable net prior period development of $21.2 million mainly due to more current membership data received during\nthat period.\nCost of care. Cost of care expenses were $85.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.8%,\ncompared to $78.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase is due to increases in pharmacy costs, partially offset\nby a reduction in headcount and payroll related costs in the current period, as compared to the prior period.\n(38)\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of\n$2.7 million, or 37.4%, compared to $7.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

We have used these funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist of salaries and labor, benefits and other employee-\nrelated costs, product and supply costs, third-party customer service, billing and collections and logistics costs, capital expenditures\nincluding patient equipment, center and office lease expenses, insurance premiums, acquisitions, and debt service.\nOur future capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including patient volume, revenue growth rates, the pace and scale of our\nexpansion in new and existing markets and any future acquisitions. Many of our capital expenditures are made in advance of patients\nbeginning service. Certain operating costs are incurred at the beginning of the equipment service period and during initial patient set up.\nWe may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, in addition to cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities in\nconnection with operating or growing our business, including debt financing that\n(39)\nmay be available to us from certain health plans for each new center that we open under the terms of our agreements with those health\nplans. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf additional capital is unavailable when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and\nadversely affected.\nRefer to Note 1, Description of Business and Going Concern, to the condensed consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere\nin this Report for details regarding our going concern considerations. As a result of our recent financial performance and current\nprojections, we do not expect to be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum liquidity covenants specified in the\nCredit Agreement or with financial covenants on certain lease agreements for the twelve months from the date of issuance of the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Report. As a result, the indebtedness outstanding under the\nCredit Agreement, and certain operating and finance lease liabilities related to agreements with which we were in default, were\nclassified as current within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Facilities\nCredit Agreement\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provided for an aggregate of up to $300\nmillion in term loans, comprised of (i) initial term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $190 million (the “Initial Term Loans”)\nand (ii) a delayed term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $110 million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loans”). The Credit\nAgreement permits the Company to enter into certain incremental facilities subject to compliance with the terms, conditions and\ncovenants set forth therein. In May 2022, the Company drew $190.0 million of the Initial Term Loans and used approximately $121.0\nmillion of the net proceeds from this borrowing to repay its outstanding obligations under Existing Credit Agreement and recognized\nrelated debt extinguishment losses of $6.2 million.\nThe Credit Agreement contains embedded derivatives related to optional and mandatory prepayments, default interest and the impact of\npotential legislative changes. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract, and are carried at fair value when: (a) the\nembedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the\nhost contract; and (b) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument. The Company\nhas concluded that certain embedded derivatives within the Credit Agreement meet these criteria and, as such, are valued separate and\napart from the Credit Agreement and are recorded at fair value each reporting period.\nIn March 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment amended the\nCredit Agreement to, among other things, (i) provide for a new incremental delayed draw term loan B facility in an aggregate principal\namount of $60.0 million; (ii) revise the commitment expiration date for the Company’s existing $110.0 million Delayed Draw Term\nLoan to forty-five days following the Amendment Closing Date, (iii) extend the commencement of amortization payments on loans\nunder the Credit Agreement from March 31, 2024 to May 31, 2025; (iv) reduce the amount of interest that the Company may elect to\ncapitalize from 4.00% to 3.50% beginning on the second anniversary of the execution date of the Credit Agreement, 3.00% beginning\non the third anniversary of the execution date of the Credit Agreement, and 1.50% beginning on December 10, 2025; (v) increase the\namount of the super-priority revolving credit facility that is permitted to be added to the Credit Agreement to $45.0 million and provide\nthat the entirety of such facility may be used for general corporate purposes; and (vi) amend the prepayment provisions of the Credit\nAgreement, including to have such provisions run as of the Amendment Closing Date.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur\nadditional indebtedness, liens or encumbrances, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions or sell certain\nassets, to make certain restricted payments or pay dividends, to enter into consolidations, to transact with affiliates and to amend certain\nagreements, subject in each case to the exceptions and other qualifications as provided in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement\nalso contains covenants that require the Company to satisfy a minimum liquidity requirement of $50.0 million, which may be decreased\nto $25.0 million if the Company achieves a certain adjusted EBITDA, and maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio based on the\nCompany’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with de novo losses excluded from the calculation of such ratio\nfor up to 36 months after the opening of a de novo center, which maximum total leverage ratio will initially be 8.50 to 1.00,\ncommencing with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 and is subject to a series of step-downs. For the fiscal quarters ending\nSeptember 30, 2026 and thereafter the Company must maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio no greater than 5.50 to 1.00.\n(40)\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Third Amendment Effective Date”), the Company entered into a Waiver and Third Amendment to Credit\nAgreement (the “Third Amendment”) among us, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders party thereto and Jefferies\nFinance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Third Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other\nthings, (i) waive certain events of default under the Credit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through May 15, 2024 (the\n“Third Amendment Specified Period”), subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events;\n(ii) increase the applicable margin rate by 2.00% during the Third Amendment Specified Period, which additional interest we may elect\nto capitalize as principal amount on the outstanding loans; and (iii) modify certain covenants contained in the Credit Agreement,\nincluding, but not limited to, reducing the minimum liquidity requirement to $10 million during the Third Amendment Specified Period\nand providing for additional reporting to the lenders.\nOn May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Fourth\nAmendment”). The Fourth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the waiver of certain events of\ndefault under the Credit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 17, 2024 (the “Temporary Waiver Period”),\nsubject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Fifth\nAmendment”). The Fifth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the Credit\nAgreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 24, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Sixth\nAmendment”). The Sixth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the Credit\nAgreement in the limited manner set forth therein through June 28, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nOn June 28, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Seventh\nAmendment”). The Seventh Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to extend the waiver of certain events of default under the\nCredit Agreement in the limited manner set forth therein through July 8, 2024, subject to an earlier termination of the waiver upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there was no remaining availability under the Delayed Draw Term Loans.\nBased on the elections made by the Company, as of June 30, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest of Term SOFR\n(calculated as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website, plus the applicable\ncredit spread adjustment based on the elected interest period) plus an applicable margin rate of 11.00%. As permitted under the Credit\nAgreement, the Company elected to capitalize 6.00% of the interest as principal amount. As a result of this election, the cash interest\ncomponent of the applicable margin increased by 0.50%. Amortization payments under the Credit Agreement are payable in quarterly\ninstallments, commencing on May 31, 2025, in aggregate principal amounts equal to 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal\namount of Initial Term Loans and Delayed Draw Term Loans. All amounts owed under the Credit Agreement are due in May 2027.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended\nthrough the Seventh Amendment.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”), by and among\nSparta Merger Sub I Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Sparta Merger Sub II Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Sparta Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger LLC I”), Sparta Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (together with Merger LLC I, the “Guarantors”), Steward Accountable Care Network, Inc.\n(n/k/a as Steward Accountable Care Network, LLC) and Steward National Care Network, Inc. (n/k/a Steward National Care Network,\nLLC), as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), CAJ Lending LLC (“CAJ”) and Deerfield Partners L.P., as lenders (the “Lenders”), and CAJ, as\nadministrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”). Mr. Carlos A. de Solo, a director of the Company and the\nCompany’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alberto de Solo, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating\nOfficer, and Mr. Joseph N. De Vera, the Company’s Senior Vice President and Legal Counsel, have interests in CAJ.\n(41)\nPursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders provided the Borrowers a term loan (the “Term Loan”) in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $35.5 million. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan to fund the Financed Net Pre-Closing Medicare\nAR acquired in connection with the Steward Acquisition.\nThe Term Loan bore an interest rate at 12.0% per annum. In addition, the Borrowers paid a facility fee equal to 3.0% of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the Term Loan.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement matured on the earlier of November 30, 2023, or three business days after the Borrowers receive\npayment for the Financed Net Pre-Closing Medicare AR from the federal government. In October 2023, the Company paid off all\noutstanding indebtedness of $35.5 million due under the Loan and Security Agreement with the proceeds of the MSSP payment from\nthe federal government, and the Loan and Security Agreement was terminated.\nElevance Health Collaboration Agreement\nIn connection with our collaboration agreement with Elevance Health, Elevance Health has agreed to provide debt financing of up to\n$1.0 million for each new center opened in partnership with Elevance Health.\nIn October 2022, in connection with the Elevance Health Collaboration Agreement we entered into a promissory note for an amount of\n$1.0 million, due in October 2032. Funds received from Elevance Health pursuant to the aforementioned promissory note will be used\nto finance costs of one new center that was opened in partnership with Elevance Health.\nFinance Leases\nWe lease certain of our center facilities under non-cancelable finance lease agreements. Refer to Note 12, Leases, in the notes to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for additional information, including the schedule of remaining lease payments. The\nremaining duration of such leases ranges from 19 to 20 years.\nThe Company’s finance leases, two of the operating leases, and one lease that has not yet commenced, contain various covenants, that\nrequire the Company, among other things, to maintain minimum consolidated stockholder's equity of $100.0 million and a minimum\ncash balance of $25.0 million. Refer to Note 12, Leases, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information\nregarding events of default on certain of our leases.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (48,114) $ (43,263)\nNet cash used in investing activities (794) (5,234)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (189) 61,477\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $48.1 million, an increase of\n$4.9 million, as compared to $43.3 million used in operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase is\nprimarily the result of the disbursement of a MSSP surety bond payment of $7.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024\n(none in 2023).\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million and $5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, driven by investments in leasehold improvements and medical equipment for our centers.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.2 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which\nconsisted of payments related to financed equipment purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $61.5 million during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023, driven mainly by the $62.0 million drawn on our Delayed Draw Term Facility, net of the related\ndiscount and issuance costs.\n(42)\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under the Credit Agreement and operating and finance leases for our centers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2024, or 2023, other than operating or finance leases which have not\nyet commenced.\nJOBS Act\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial\naccounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective\nor do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial\naccounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the\nrequirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt\nout of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for\npublic or private companies, as an emerging growth company, we can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies\nadopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our consolidated financial statements with a public company which is\nneither an emerging growth company, nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period,\ndifficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOther than as noted below, there have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates presented in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the\ncarrying value of the asset to the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, which include\nthe amount and timing of the projected future cash flows. If the expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the\nasset, then the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying value is written down to fair value.\nFair value estimates used in the impairment review of long-lived assets are determined using a future cash flow model involving several\nassumptions. Changes in the Company’s assumptions could materially impact fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to our fair\nvalue estimates are: (i) projected cash flows and (ii) discount rates. These and other assumptions may change in the future based on\nspecific facts and circumstances. While the Company believes the assumptions used to estimate the future cash flows are reasonable,\nthere can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized. As a result, impairment charges that possibly would have\nbeen recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from estimates. The\nuse of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted cash flows, therefore, could change impairment determinations.\nAsset impairment charges are recognized based on the relative fair value of the long-lived assets. Asset impairment charges are\nrecognized in impairments of long-lived assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company identified triggering events as of June 30, 2024 and evaluated its long-lived assets for impairments. Fair value of the\nCompany's assets groups was determined based on a discounted cash flow method. Based on the assessment performed, the Company\nrecognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $133.0 million.\nInterim Goodwill Assessment\nThe Company’s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, or on an interim basis if an event triggering\nimpairment may have occurred. The Company identified triggering events as of June 30, 2024 and tested goodwill for\n(43)\nimpairment. Fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit was based on the Company’s market capitalization. Based on this\nanalysis, no goodwill impairment was identified.\nThe Company estimates that a decrease of 1% in the value of the Company’s Class A common stock would not result in recognition of\ngoodwill impairment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this\nReport, for additional information.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information\notherwise required under this item.\n(44)\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that\nwe file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nUnder supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in internal control\nover financial reporting described below.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weaknesses described further below, our management has performed additional analyses,\nreconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nthis Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for\nthe periods presented.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis.\nAs previously disclosed in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of the Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the following material weaknesses were identified as of December 31, 2023: We lack a sufficient\ncomplement of professionals with the appropriate level of knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and\ndisclose accounting matters commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements as a public company. This material\nweakness contributed to the Company not designing and maintaining formal controls to analyze, account for and disclose complex\ntransactions, including the accounting for financial instruments and contingent earnout liabilities. These material weaknesses resulted\nin:\n• the restatement of the Company’s previously filed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December\n31, 2020, as well as the quarterly condensed consolidated financial information for the 2020 interim period ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 related to derivative warrant liabilities, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption,\nadditional paid-in-capital, retained earnings/(deficit), fair value adjustment on derivative warrant liabilities, earnings per\nshare and the related disclosures;\n• the restatement of the Company’s previously filed quarterly condensed consolidated financial information for the 2021\ninterim periods ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 related to goodwill, contingent earnout liabilities, additional\npaid-in capital, retained earnings/(deficit), gain/(loss) on remeasurement of earnout liabilities, earnings per share and the\nrelated disclosures; and\n• the restatement of the Company’s previously filed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December\n31, 2021, as well as the quarterly condensed consolidated financial information for the 2021 interim period ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and the 2022 interim periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 related to\nother current assets and other assets.\nSubsequent to the evaluation performed as of December 31, 2023, management identified an additional material weakness as the\nCompany did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for revenue and accounts receivable transactions,\nincluding controls to validate the terms of the underlying revenue and accounts receivable transactions were appropriately recorded.\nThis material weakness, which was determined to have existed as of December 31, 2023, resulted in immaterial misstatements in\nrevenue, external provider costs, accounts receivable, net, and risk settlement liabilities as of and for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, and the quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2022,\nJune 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\n(45)\nThese material weaknesses could result in misstatements of substantially all accounts or disclosures that would result in a material\nmisstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nRemediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses\nSince identifying the material weaknesses previously disclosed in Item 9A of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023, management has developed a remediation plan and implemented measures to address the underlying causes of each material\nweakness. Our efforts to date included the following:\n• We engaged an external advisor to assist in evaluating and documenting the design and operating effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n• In 2022, we hired a Vice President of Financial Reporting and Technical Accounting and a Chief Accounting Officer, both\nwith technical public company accounting and financial reporting experience.\n• We enhanced access to accounting training, literature, research materials and documents for our finance and accounting\ndepartments.\n• During the second and third quarters of 2023, we performed a financial statement risk assessment and identified areas\nwhere new key controls are needed, or existing controls needed to be enhanced.\n• During the second and third quarters of 2023, we designed and implemented controls to address the entity level and\nfinancial reporting risks identified, including those involving accounting for complex transactions, including financial\ninstruments and contingent earnout liabilities.\n• During the second and third quarters of 2023, together with our external advisor, we designed a formal testing program to\nevaluate the design and operating effectiveness of key controls and began executing the formal testing program.\n• During the third and fourth quarters of 2023, our external advisor performed key control testing consistent with our formal\ntesting program.\nWith respect to the additional material weakness related to the accounting for revenue and accounts receivable transactions, we are still\ndeveloping our remediation plan, which will include (i) evaluating the staffing level, skills and qualification of personnel responsible\nfor accounting for these transactions, (ii) enhancement of the design of our existing control activities and processes for revenue\nrecognition and (iii) improving the detailed review process of our revenue recognition models.\nAlthough we have implemented controls as of June 30, 2024 related to the previously identified material weaknesses, the controls have\nnot been in place and operating effectively for a sufficient period to evaluate if the material weaknesses have been remediated.\nAlthough no assurance can be made that such remediation will occur, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified, we\nbelieve we are making progress toward achieving the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee\noversight. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting, which may necessitate additional changes to the design and implementation of controls.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n(46)\nPART II. – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, CareMax may be involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Although the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, CareMax is not currently a party to\nany legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to CareMax, are believed to, either individually or taken together,\nhave a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition, except as set forth in\n“Litigation” of Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report.\nRegardless of the outcome, litigation has the potential to have an adverse impact on CareMax because of defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the principal risks that we believe to be material to our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nOur rights under existing agreements could be impaired as a result of bankruptcy proceedings brought by Steward Health Care\nSystem.\nIn connection with the closing of the Steward Acquisition, CareMax and Steward Health Care Network, Inc. (“SHCN”) entered into an\nexclusive access agreement pursuant to which SHCN is required to exclusively make its participating provider network available to\nCareMax for the provision of services to MA members under MA risk agreements for an initial period of ten years, with a ten-year\nautomatic renewal term, unless either party provides 180 days’ notice prior to the expiration of the initial term of its decision not to\nrenew. In connection with the access agreement and other ancillary agreements, SHCN delegated its rights, duties and obligations with\nrespect to MA risk contracting to CareMax, including, without limitation, SHCN’s right to enforce certain exclusivity provisions in its\nagreements with participating providers. For a period of two years following the date of the Steward Acquisition, SHCN is\ncontractually obligated to remove any participating provider from its network who terminates its provider agreement contract with\nCareMax. Further, CareMax entered into exclusive direct participating provider agreements with Steward Health Care System’s captive\nphysician practices for an initial term of ten years with a ten-year automatic renewal term unless either party provides 180 days’ notice\nprior to the expiration of the initial term of its decision not to renew.\nOn May 6, 2024, Steward Health Care System and certain of its affiliates commenced an in-court restructuring process through the\nfiling of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Texas. In June 2024, as part of these bankruptcy proceedings, Steward Health Care System moved to reject certain of the\nexecutory contracts between Steward Health Care System and/or its affiliates and CareMax and/or its affiliates, including, but not\nlimited to, the exclusive access agreement and employed provider participating provider agreements and other ancillary agreements.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court grants Steward Health Care Network’s motion to reject the executory contracts, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, in particular with respect to the MSO.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 5. Other Information\nSecurities trading plans of Directors and Executive Officers\n(47)\nDuring the last fiscal quarter, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the\nadoption and termination of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” each as defined in Item\n408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
