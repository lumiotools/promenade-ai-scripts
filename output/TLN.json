Our fleet continued to run well this quarter, which is reflected in our year-to-date results. We are raising and narrowing our 2024 guidance ranges and reaffirming guidance for 2025,” said Talen President and Chief Executive Officer Mac McFarland.\n\n“Progress at the AWS data center campus is accelerating with our acquisition of TeraWulf’s minority share of the Nautilus JV, enabling the campus to access power more quickly and easily. We are obviously disappointed with the FERC’s recent decision on the Susquehanna ISA. That said, we are moving forward with AWS on commercial solutions,” McFarland continued. “We continue to execute on our share repurchase program, which has a remaining capacity of $1.2 billion.”\n\n**Summary of Financial and Operating Results (Unaudited)**\n\n**(Millions of Dollars Unless Otherwise Stated)**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---|---|---|---  \nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Stockholders| $| 168| $| (77| )| $| 916  \nAdjusted EBITDA| 230| 224| 606  \nAdjusted Free Cash Flow| 97| 146| 262  \nTotal Generation (TWh) (a)| 10.8| 10.9| 27.1  \nCarbon-Free Generation| 43| %| 44| %| 49| %  \nOSHA TRIR (b)| 0.4| 1.1| 0.3  \nFleet EFOF (c)| 3.1| %| 5.0| %| 2.4| %  \n  \n__________________  \n---  \n(a)| Aggregate generation is net of station use consumption, where applicable, and includes volumes produced by Susquehanna in support of Nautilus operations.  \n(b)| OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (“OSHA TRIR”) is the number of recordable incidents x 200,000 / total number of manhours worked. Only includes Talen-operated generation facilities (i.e., excludes Conemaugh and Keystone).  \n(c)| Fleet Equivalent Forced Outage Factor (“Fleet EFOF”) is the percentage of a given period in which a generating unit is not available due to forced outages and forced de-rates. Represents all generation facilities, including our portion of partially-owned facilities.  \n  \nFor the third quarter 2024, Talen reported GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Stockholders of $168 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $230 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $97 million.\n\nCompared to the same quarter last year, GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Stockholders was $245 million higher, primarily driven by (i) higher recognized unrealized hedge gains due to lower forward prices as of September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, and (ii) an increase in the net gain of the nuclear facility decommissioning trust from stronger investment returns due to improved equity markets and declining interest rates.\n\nCompared to the same quarter last year, Adjusted EBITDA was $6 million higher primarily due to strong PJM generation fleet performance driven by improved spark spreads and accrued Nuclear PTC revenue, despite the absence of earnings from the ERCOT generation portfolio that was sold in March 2024.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow, which was $49 million lower compared to the same quarter last year, included higher pension plan contributions and accelerated nuclear fuel purchases.\n\nAdditionally, for the third quarter 2024, Talen’s fleet continued to run reliably and safely, with a Fleet EFOF of 3.1% and an OSHA TRIR of 0.4. Total generation was 10.8 TWh, with 43% contributed from carbon-free nuclear generation at our Susquehanna nuclear facility.\n\nGiven the impacts of fresh start accounting and the implementation of the plan of reorganization in the second quarter 2023, our financial position and results of operations for year-to-date 2024 are not comparable to our financial position or results of operations for year-to-date 2023.\n\n**Raising and Narrowing 2024 Guidance; Reaffirming 2025 Guidance**\n\n**(Millions of Dollars)**| **_Range_**  \n---|---  \n2024E Adjusted EBITDA| $750 – $780  \n2024E Adjusted Free Cash Flow| $265 – $285  \n  \n**(Millions of Dollars)**| **_Range_**  \n---|---  \n2025E Adjusted EBITDA| $925 – $1,175  \n2025E Adjusted Free Cash Flow| $395 – $595  \n  \nTalen is raising and narrowing the 2024 guidance ranges and reaffirming the 2025 guidance ranges.\n\n**Update on Share Repurchase Program**\n\nSince the start of 2024, Talen has repurchased approximately 14% of its outstanding shares for a total of $952 million, with $1.2 billion of remaining repurchase capacity through year-end 2026. All share repurchase amounts are excluding transaction costs.\n\nDuring the third quarter 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $117.64 per share. These repurchases included shares purchased from our largest shareholder.\n\n**Index Inclusion**\n\nAfter uplisting to the NASDAQ Global Select Market and based on their respective methodologies, Talen became eligible to join several equity indices, which could drive substantial institutional and passive stock demand. During the third quarter 2024, Talen was added to the S&P Total Market Index, S&P Completion Index, CRSP Total Market Index, and CRSP Small Cap Index. These additions led to passive index funds acquiring more than six million shares of Talen common stock.\n\nOn November 6, 2024, MSCI announced Talen will be added to the MSCI USA Small Cap Index, effective after market close on November 25, 2024. Talen may qualify for additional value, growth, and / or sector-related indices, leading to further demand for our shares.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nTalen is focused on maintaining net leverage below our target of 3.5x net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA, along with ample liquidity. As of November 8, 2024, Talen had total available liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion, comprised of $557 million of unrestricted cash and $700 million of available capacity under its revolving credit facility. Talen’s current net leverage ratio, utilizing the midpoint of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance and net debt balance as of November 8, 2024, is approximately 2.1x.\n\n**Update on Hedging Activities**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, including the impact of the Nuclear PTC, Talen had hedged approximately 100% of its expected generation volumes for the balance of 2024, 64% for 2025 and 18% for 2026. The Company’s hedging program is a key component of its comprehensive fiscal policy and supports the objective of increasing cash flow stability while maintaining upside optionality.\n\n**Earnings Call**\n\nThe Company will hold an earnings call on Thursday, November 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. EST (9:00 a.m. CST).

Generally, non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions readers of these materials not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures, but to also consider them along with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to: (i) assist in comparing operating performance and readily view operating trends on a consistent basis from period to period without certain items that may distort financial results; (ii) plan and forecast overall expectations and evaluate actual results against such expectations; (iii) communicate with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts, and the broader financial community concerning our financial performance; (iv) set performance metrics for the Company’s annual short-term incentive compensation; and (v) assess compliance with our indebtedness.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is computed as net income (loss) adjusted, among other things, for certain: (i) nonrecurring charges; (ii) non-recurring gains; (iii) non-cash and other items; (iv) unusual market events; (v) any depreciation, amortization, or accretion; (vi) mark-to-market gains or losses; (vii) gains and losses on the nuclear facility decommissioning trust (“NDT”); (viii) gains and losses on asset sales, dispositions, and asset retirement; (ix) impairments, obsolescence, and net realizable value charges; (x) interest expense; (xi) income taxes; (xii) legal settlements, liquidated damages, and contractual terminations; (xiii) development expenses; (xiv) noncontrolling interests; and (xv) other adjustments. Such adjustments are computed consistently with the provisions of our indebtedness to the extent that they can be derived from the financial records of the business. Pursuant to TES’s debt agreements, Cumulus Digital contributes to Adjusted EBITDA beginning in the first quarter 2024, following termination of the Cumulus Digital credit facility and associated cash flow sweep.\n\nAdditionally, we believe investors commonly adjust net income (loss) information to eliminate the effect of nonrecurring restructuring expenses, and other non-cash charges, which vary widely from company to company and from period to period and impair comparability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of the financial statements to evaluate our operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to such items described above. These adjustments can vary substantially from company to company and period to period depending upon accounting policies, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\n**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_**\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow, a key non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful metric utilized by our chief operating decision makers to evaluate cash flow activities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is computed as Adjusted EBITDA reduced by capital expenditures (including nuclear fuel but excluding development, growth and (or) conversion capital expenditures), cash payments for interest and finance charges, cash payments for taxes (excluding income taxes paid from the NDT), and pension contributions.\n\nWe believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to determine a company’s ability to meet future obligations and to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is widely used by investors to measure a company’s levered cash flow without regard to items such as ARO settlements; nonrecurring development, growth and conversion expenditures; and cash proceeds or payments for the sale or purchase of assets, which can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nPlease see below for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to “Net Income (Loss),” the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not intended to replace “Net Income (Loss),” a measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA / Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation_**\n\nThe reconciliations from “Net Income (Loss)” presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the periods were:\n\n**Successor**| **Predecessor**  \n---|---  \n**(Millions of Dollars)**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **May 18 through September 30, 2023**| **January 1 through May 17, 2023**  \nNet Income (Loss)| $|  168| $|  (76| )| $|  945| $|  (45| )| $|  465  \n**Adjustments**  \nInterest expense and other finance charges|  66|  68|  187|  101|  163  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense|  11|  (16| )|  192|  3|  212  \nDepreciation, amortization and accretion|  75|  66|  225|  94|  200  \nNuclear fuel amortization|  30|  47|  93|  72|  33  \nReorganization (gain) loss, net (a)|  —|  —|  —|  —|  (799| )  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative contracts|  (102| )|  84|  (58| )|  43|  63  \nNuclear decommissioning trust funds (gain) loss, net|  (67| )|  24|  (169| )|  (15| )|  (57| )  \nStock-based compensation expense|  8|  9|  24|  11|  —  \nLong-term incentive compensation expense|  3|  —|  19|  —|  —  \n(Gain) loss on asset sales, net (b)|  —|  —|  (885| )|  —|  (50| )  \nNon-cash impairments (c)|  —|  2|  —|  2|  381  \nOperational and other restructuring activities|  40|  4|  61|  30|  17  \nDevelopment expenses|  1|  5|  1|  7|  10  \nNon-cash inventory net realizable value, obsolescence, and other charges (d)|  2|  (2| )|  5|  1|  56  \nNoncontrolling interest|  (3| )|  (14| )|  (21| )|  (22| )|  (14| )  \nOther|  (2| )|  23|  (13| )|  21|  15  \n**Total Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **230**| **$**| **224**| **$**| **606**| **$**| **303**| **$**| **695**  \nCapital expenditures, net|  (55| )|  (48| )|  (135| )|  (71| )|  (96| )  \nInterest and finance charge payments|  (36| )|  (27| )|  (161| )|  (36| )|  (173| )  \nTax payments|  (1| )|  (2| )|  (3| )|  (3| )|  (5| )  \nPension contributions|  (41| )|  (1| )|  (45| )|  (2| )|  (3| )  \n**Total Adjusted Free Cash Flow**| **$**| **97**| **$**| **146**| **$**| **262**| **$**| **191**| **$**| **418**  \n  \n_______________  \n---  \n(a)| See Note 2 in Notes to the Q3 2024 Financial Statements for additional information.  \n(b)| See Note 17 in Notes to the Q3 2024 Financial Statements for additional information.  \n(c)| See Note 8 in Notes to the Q3 2024 Financial Statements for additional information.  \n(d)| See Note 6 in Notes to the Q3 2024 Financial Statements for additional information.  \n  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA / Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation: 2024 Guidance_**\n\n**2024E**  \n---  \n**(Millions of dollars)**| **Low**| **High**  \nNet Income (Loss)| $|  735| $|  765  \nAdjustments  \nInterest expense and other finance charges|  240|  240  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense|  190|  190  \nDepreciation, amortization and accretion|  300|  300  \nNuclear fuel amortization|  120|  120  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative contracts|  60|  60  \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets|  (885| )|  (885| )  \nOther|  (10| )|  (10| )  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **750**| **$**| **780**  \nCapital expenditures, net| $|  (185| )| $|  (190| )  \nInterest and finance charge payments|  (240| )|  (240| )  \nTax payments (a)|  (5| )|  (5| )  \nPension contributions|  (55| )|  (60| )  \n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow**| **$**| **265**| **$**| **285**  \n  \n_______________Note: Figures include January - April contribution from the ERCOT generation fleet and are rounded to the nearest $5mm.(a) Excludes income taxes paid from the NDT.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA / Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation: 2025 Guidance_**\n\n**2025E**  \n---  \n**(Millions of dollars)**| **Low**| **High**  \nNet Income (Loss)| $|  190| $|  410  \nAdjustments  \nInterest expense and other finance charges|  215|  225  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense|  90|  110  \nDepreciation, amortization and accretion|  295|  295  \nNuclear fuel amortization|  105|  105  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative contracts|  30|  30  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **925**| **$**| **1,175**  \nCapital expenditures, net| $|  (195| )| $|  (205| )  \nInterest and finance charge payments|  (215| )|  (225| )  \nTax payments (a)|  (65| )|  (85| )  \nPension contributions|  (55| )|  (65| )  \n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow**| **$**| **395**| **$**| **595**  \n  \n_______________Note: Figures are rounded to the nearest $5mm.

Talen believes FERC erred and we are evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions. We believe this ISA amendment is just and reasonable and in the best interest of consumers. FERC’s decision will have a chilling effect on economic development in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Jersey.\n\nImportantly, the existing ISA allows for 300 megawatts of co-located load at Susquehanna, and development of the first phases of the Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) data center campus can proceed using those 300 megawatts while Talen continues to pursue approval of the amended ISA. \n\nContrary to the Commission’s ruling, Talen’s co-location arrangement with AWS is part of the solution to issues raised on November 1 at the FERC technical conference on large co-located load. It brings service to the customer quickly and without expensive transmission upgrades necessary to serve large-load demand. But our direct-connect configuration is just one of several commercial solutions to the demand of large loads, and we are exploring other solutions as we move forward. The data center economy will require an all-of-the-above approach to satisfy the increased demand, including co-location such as Talen’s arrangement with AWS, hybrids that co-locate primary power behind the meter while using grid power for back-up, and front-of-the-meter connections to utility transmission. Talen looks forward to the continued dialogue.\n\n**About Talen**\n\nTalen Energy ([NASDAQ: TLN](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_xJ8l1tT0tGJiajKcWjpVLvyV-cWtIi2_x4No4MHY8U3RdHFFkX8yNKd6eM-9KU9AYXtzpHQnVmqJMLIM5wEpSZ7r9DyvrAaFEVHUJpwl41yN1ZcAARgH2vYs_14NrBt)) is a leading independent power producer and energy infrastructure company dedicated to powering the future. We own and operate approximately 10.7 gigawatts of power infrastructure in the United States, including 2.2 gigawatts of nuclear power and a significant dispatchable fossil fleet. We produce and sell electricity, capacity, and ancillary services into wholesale U.S. power markets, with our generation fleet principally located in the Mid-Atlantic and Montana. Our team is committed to generating power safely and reliably, delivering the most value per megawatt produced and driving the energy transition. Talen is also powering the digital infrastructure revolution. We are well-positioned to capture this significant growth opportunity, as data centers serving artificial intelligence increasingly demand more reliable, clean power.
