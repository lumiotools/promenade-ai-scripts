Should you enter into any transactions, ensure that you have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such investments are appropriate for you. In this respect please note that:\n\n  * any investment in investment products involves substantial risks, which may vary depending on the nature of the Investment Product, and which are more particularly identified in the relevant Offering Document;\n  * the price and value of interests in the Investment Products can go down as well as up and so the return on your investment may vary. You may not get back the original amount invested and may lose all of your investment;\n  * past performance is not a guide to future performance. To the extent that this Website contains any indications as to future performance, such forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance;\n  * the value of investments in Investment Products may be affected by the price of underlying investments and changes in any relevant foreign exchange rates;\n  * to the extent an investment in a product includes an income component, any such income from the investment may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions and taxation arrangements;\n  * tax assumptions may change if the law changes, and the value of tax relief (if any) will depend upon your individual circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisers in order to understand any applicable tax consequences;\n\n\n\nThe above list of risk factors is not complete and you must refer to the relevant Offering Documents with respect to individual Investment Products available in the Document Library at the following address <https://www.ftglobalportfolios.com/DocumentLibrary.aspx>.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

Should you enter into any transactions, ensure that you have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such investments are appropriate for you. In this respect please note that:\n\n  * any investment in investment products involves substantial risks, which may vary depending on the nature of the Investment Product, and which are more particularly identified in the relevant Offering Document;\n  * the price and value of interests in the Investment Products can go down as well as up and so the return on your investment may vary. You may not get back the original amount invested and may lose all of your investment;\n  * past performance is not a guide to future performance. To the extent that this Website contains any indications as to future performance, such forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance;\n  * the value of investments in Investment Products may be affected by the price of underlying investments and changes in any relevant foreign exchange rates;\n  * to the extent an investment in a product includes an income component, any such income from the investment may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions and taxation arrangements;\n  * tax assumptions may change if the law changes, and the value of tax relief (if any) will depend upon your individual circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisers in order to understand any applicable tax consequences;\n\n\n\nThe above list of risk factors is not complete and you must refer to the relevant Offering Documents with respect to individual Investment Products available in the Document Library at the following address <https://www.ftglobalportfolios.com/DocumentLibrary.aspx>.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

Should you enter into any transactions, ensure that you have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such investments are appropriate for you. In this respect please note that:\n\n  * any investment in investment products involves substantial risks, which may vary depending on the nature of the Investment Product, and which are more particularly identified in the relevant Offering Document;\n  * the price and value of interests in the Investment Products can go down as well as up and so the return on your investment may vary. You may not get back the original amount invested and may lose all of your investment;\n  * past performance is not a guide to future performance. To the extent that this Website contains any indications as to future performance, such forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance;\n  * the value of investments in Investment Products may be affected by the price of underlying investments and changes in any relevant foreign exchange rates;\n  * to the extent an investment in a product includes an income component, any such income from the investment may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions and taxation arrangements;\n  * tax assumptions may change if the law changes, and the value of tax relief (if any) will depend upon your individual circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisers in order to understand any applicable tax consequences;\n\n\n\nThe above list of risk factors is not complete and you must refer to the relevant Offering Documents with respect to individual Investment Products available in the Document Library at the following address <https://www.ftglobalportfolios.com/DocumentLibrary.aspx>.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

In these uncertain times, factors can help investors remain grounded and rules-based, avoiding the pitfalls of excessive optimism and uncertainty - both of which appear to characterise 2024 so far.\n\nAmidst all-time market highs, geopolitical uncertainties, and the aftermath of the U.S. Presidential election, the need for a rules-based portfolio strategy becomes ever more critical. We hear the narratives and the pundits' discussions, but what are the factors telling us?\n\nDuring our call, we will:\n\n  * **Examine Market Returns from a Factor Perspective:** We’ll delve into the current and historical performance of factors, offering insights into their relevance in today’s market environment.\n  * **Identify Current Opportunities:** Discover the most appealing factors in the current landscape. Curious about where the true “value” lies? We have the answers.\n  * **Spotlight our Newest Factor-Based ETF:** A growth strategy from our “Strength Family” which may provide some timely exposure, to high-quality companies who have the highest three-year revenue and cash flow growth.\n  * **Recap Election-Year Dynamics and Stress the Importance of Rules-Based Portfolios:** Learn how a rules-based approach enables decisive action in uncertain or overly exuberant times.\n\n\n\n[Learn more](#)\n\n[Learn more](#)\n\nLearn more\n\nRegister Now\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n![](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300)\n\n#### Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n  * Sed ornare lorem vehicula, congue diam et, [lacinia nulla.](#)\n  * Donec varius volutpat convallis.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

Should you enter into any transactions, ensure that you have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such investments are appropriate for you. In this respect please note that:\n\n  * any investment in investment products involves substantial risks, which may vary depending on the nature of the Investment Product, and which are more particularly identified in the relevant Offering Document;\n  * the price and value of interests in the Investment Products can go down as well as up and so the return on your investment may vary. You may not get back the original amount invested and may lose all of your investment;\n  * past performance is not a guide to future performance. To the extent that this Website contains any indications as to future performance, such forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance;\n  * the value of investments in Investment Products may be affected by the price of underlying investments and changes in any relevant foreign exchange rates;\n  * to the extent an investment in a product includes an income component, any such income from the investment may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions and taxation arrangements;\n  * tax assumptions may change if the law changes, and the value of tax relief (if any) will depend upon your individual circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisers in order to understand any applicable tax consequences;\n\n\n\nThe above list of risk factors is not complete and you must refer to the relevant Offering Documents with respect to individual Investment Products available in the Document Library at the following address <https://www.ftglobalportfolios.com/DocumentLibrary.aspx>.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.

We believe this helps us stay ahead of the curve. As pioneers of both rules-based investing and a leader in thematic ETFs, we have been providing access to some of the largest megatrends via ETFs since 2006 - longer than any other provider.\n\n[Learn more about Thematic Investing](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/)\n\n![](/static//images/Target_Outcome_ETF_Background3x.png)![](/static//images/Mobile-Target-Outcome-Background3x.png)\n\nInvestment Ideas\n\n## Target Outcome ETFs®\n\nTarget Outcome ETFs are actively managed ETFs that seek to provide targeted exposure to an underlying reference asset. The ETF is set up to provide a predetermined investment outcome, equipped with a feature to remove some of the uncertainty associated with investing.\n\nThe Target Outcome Buffer Series ETFs are designed to help equity investors maintain a level of protection in down markets, by seeking to provide a defined downside buffer, over a specified Target Outcome Period. At the same time the strategy looks to take advantage of growth opportunities in up markets up to a predetermined cap. The cap and buffer are reset at the end of each Target Outcome Period. However, the funds may be held indefinitely, providing investors a potential buy and hold investment opportunity.\n\n[Learn more about Target Outcome ETFs](/uk/professional/Ideas-and-Insights/Investment-Ideas/Target-Outcome-ETFs/)\n\n## Latest U.S. Market and Economic Commentary\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Brian.crop.6f771a37-aabf-4aec-a233-d4c42e0a1256.png)Wesbury Weekly OutlookBrian WesburyChief Economist at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Economics&view=LIST)\n\n[![](/static//images/frames/Dave.crop.eec14a86-0a7f-4fd5-9abf-c087833d4a85.png)Market Minute with McGarelDave McGarelChief Investment Officer at First Trust Advisors L.P.](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights/?category=Markets&view=LIST&type=Commentary)\n\n[See all](/Ideas-and-Insights/Insights?category=Markets&view=LIST)\n\n## Insights\n\n![](/static/images/resized/Powering_AIs_Extreme_Energy_Demands_with_a_Renewable_Grid_17304_645x430.jpg)\n\nArticle | Thematic Investing\n\n### Powering AI's Extreme Energy Demands with a Renewable Grid\n\nWe explore the growing energy demands of AI and its impact on power grids worldwide.
