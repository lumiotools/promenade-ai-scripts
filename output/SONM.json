We are executing on a robust portfolio of design awards with tier-one carriers in North America, Australia and Europe, allowing us to tap into a vast and varied global market to provide reliable and rugged communication solutions to customers worldwide.\n\n\"We also made significant progress in Europe, an important part of our commercial outlook.

Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain material non-cash items and other adjustments, such as stock-based compensation.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including: one-time non-cash asset impairment costs as they do not reflect normal operations; non-cash equity grants made to employees at a certain price do not necessarily reflect the performance of our business at such time, and as such, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance; and non-cash depreciation and amortization are not considered a key measure of our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA: as a measure of operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and as a consideration in determining compensation for certain key employees.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: it does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; it does not reflect interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; and other companies in our industry may define and/or calculate this metric differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024**  \nNet loss | $ | (2,512 | ) | $ | (6,616 | )  \nImpairment of contract fulfillment assets | - | 3,217  \nDepreciation and amortization | 918 | 845  \nStock-based compensation | 373 | 472  \nInterest expense | - | 17  \nIncome taxes | 117 | 37  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (1,104 | ) | $ | (2,028 | )  \n  \n[*] Non-GAAP financial measure.

launched new rugged phone in Europe\n\nSan Diego, California--(Newsfile Corp. - November 13, 2024) - [**Sonim Technologies, Inc.**](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/X3NMAuRQjP) **(Nasdaq: SONM)** , a leading provider of mobility solutions that include ultra-rugged and rugged phones, connected devices, software, services and accessories designed to provide extra protection for users that demand more durability in their work and everyday lives, reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenues increased 30.4% sequentially to $15.0 million, from $11.5 million in the second quarter\n  * GAAP net loss for the quarter was $2.5 million, compared to $6.6 million, which included a $3.2 million impairment charge, in the second quarter\n  * Adjusted EBITDA[*]was negative $1.1 million, improved from negative $2.0 million in the second quarter 2024\n  * Ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.1 million, trade accounts receivable of $5.2 million, and inventory valued at $12.4 million\n  * Expanded new product launch activity with carriers and distributors in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Australia for Sonim's new portfolio of connected solutions and next-generation rugged devices\n  * Unveiled new XP400 smartphone and XP100 feature phone devices for the European and South African markets\n  * Launched new H700 5G rugged mobile hotspot device in Australia, the industry's first rugged Release 17 5G, Wi-Fi 7 mobile hotspot\n  * Launched new H500 5G rugged mobile hotspot with Verizon Wireless in North America, the industry's first rugged 5G millimeter wave mobile hotspot\n  * Secured a major device upgrade agreement with a leading Fortune 500 company in the food and beverage industry, strengthening Sonim's reputation as a reliable brand and partner for enterprise field workers\n\n\n\nPeter Liu, Sonim's Chief Executive Officer, said: \"Revenue grew in the third quarter as demand for our existing rugged smartphones increased and major global markets expand their adoption of our new rugged mobile phone and connected solutions devices, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. We are executing on a robust portfolio of design awards with tier-one carriers in North America, Australia and Europe, allowing us to tap into a vast and varied global market to provide reliable and rugged communication solutions to customers worldwide.\n\n\"We also made significant progress in Europe, an important part of our commercial outlook. We have expanded distribution and added key sales and marketing personnel to service customers needing a reliable new solution provider following the departure of a major rugged device provider.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.0 million, an increase from $11.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue increased due to higher demand for the Company's rugged phones.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million, or 28.2% of revenues, an increase from second quarter of 2024 gross profit of $3.0 million, or 25.8% of revenues. The improved gross margin reflected the Company's exit from lower margin white-label products and the launch of additional new products at top global carriers.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.6 million, a decrease from $9.4 million in the preceding quarter that included a charge of $3.2 million for impairment of contract fulfillment assets. Excluding the impairment charge, operating expenses increased $0.4 million due to higher legal expenses.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million, a decrease from a net loss of $6.6 million, which included a $3.2 million impairment charge, in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA* was negative $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to negative $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"The third quarter initiated sequential growth in our rugged mobile product lines after our strategic exit from a lower margin ODM business that accounted for approximately half of our revenue in 2023 and significant revenue in the first quarter of 2024,\" said Clay Crolius, Chief Financial Officer of Sonim.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Working Capital**\n\nSonim ended the third quarter of 2024 with $9.1 million in cash and equivalents and remained essentially debt free. Trade accounts receivable was $5.2 million and inventory was $12.4 million as the Company prepared for an additional new product launch with a tier one carrier.\n\n**About Sonim Technologies** Sonim Technologies is a leading U.S. provider of ultra-rugged and rugged mobile solutions, including phones, wireless internet data devices, accessories and software designed to provide extra protection for users that demand more durability in their work and everyday lives.

Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain material non-cash items and other adjustments, such as stock-based compensation.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including: one-time non-cash asset impairment costs as they do not reflect normal operations; non-cash equity grants made to employees at a certain price do not necessarily reflect the performance of our business at such time, and as such, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance; and non-cash depreciation and amortization are not considered a key measure of our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA: as a measure of operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and as a consideration in determining compensation for certain key employees.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: it does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; it does not reflect interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; and other companies in our industry may define and/or calculate this metric differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024**  \nNet loss | $ | (2,512 | ) | $ | (6,616 | )  \nImpairment of contract fulfillment assets | - | 3,217  \nDepreciation and amortization | 918 | 845  \nStock-based compensation | 373 | 472  \nInterest expense | - | 17  \nIncome taxes | 117 | 37  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (1,104 | ) | $ | (2,028 | )  \n  \n[*] Non-GAAP financial measure.

Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial\nmetric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain\nitems that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain material\nnon-cash items and other adjustments, such as stock-based compensation.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported\nGAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and\noverall results of operations for various reasons, including: one-time non-cash asset\nimpairment costs as they do not reflect normal operations; non-cash equity grants made to\nemployees at a certain price do not necessarily reflect the performance of our business at\nsuch time, and as such, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our\noperating performance; and non-cash depreciation and amortization are not considered a\nkey measure of our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA: as a measure of\noperating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and\nforecasts; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; in communications with our board of\ndirectors concerning our financial performance; and as a consideration in determining\ncompensation for certain key employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in\nisolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of\nthese limitations include: it does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for\ncapital expenditures or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash\nrequirements for, working capital needs; it does not reflect interest expense on our debt or\nthe cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; and other\ncompanies in our industry may define and/or calculate this metric differently than we do,\nlimiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective\nperiods (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nNet loss $ (2,512) $ (6,616)\nImpairment of contract fulfillment assets - 3,217\nDepreciation and amortization 918 845\nStock-based compensation 373 472\nInterest expense - 17\nIncome taxes 117 37\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (1,104) $ (2,028)\n[*] Non-GAAP financial measure. An explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are presented at the end of this press release.\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit\nhttps://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/229820\nSOURCE Sonim Technologies, Inc."
