This strategic move builds upon SRM’s existing media relationship with Suretone Pictures and underscores SRM’s commitment to delivering high-quality entertainment content across various platforms. SRM Media’s first acquisition, courtesy of its new Suretone Pictures partnership in the making, is Suretone Pictures’ critically acclaimed Western “The Kid,” a 2019 Western/Action film currently streaming on AMAZON Prime. The Kid is a reimagining of the Billy the Kid legend starring Ethan Hawke, Chris Pratt, and Dane DeHaan. Directed by Vincent D’Onofrio, the film has been praised for its powerful performances, stunning cinematography, and fresh take on a classic tale. This acquisition aligns with SRM Media’s vision to acquire and distribute compelling films and television content while leveraging SRM Entertainment’s expertise in merchandising and licensing to maximize IP value.\n\n**To view the trailer for “The Kid,” please visit:**[**www.srmentertainment.com**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0oYsd6Sh1811zeYoL_YBenqi07OsCBt2_JQC_WFTb3CLK6Eu6RvN-xnQoSFQ_MvcI_pjVJNjTUwMqAscQRaK9Z9_8xTlenM24gemTyekIQm0qI-zTl89lmu25eUqisvJgpmHfE2V20Ra2S1kapIQSA==)\n\n“The launch of SRM Media represents a significant step forward in our strategy to diversify and expand our entertainment offerings,” says Rich Miller, CEO of SRM Entertainment. \n\n“This is vertical integration at its best, and it presents endless possibilities for SRM. Our focus is on acquiring high-quality films like ‘The Kid’ that provide long-term, revenue streams. High-quality films, even with modest budgets, can generate returns long after their initial box office release, especially when they feature a well-known cast like ‘The Kid.’ These actors have dedicated followers who will seek out the film on streaming platforms like Amazon, where it will be available. Furthermore, the iconic characters and storyline present exciting opportunities for merchandise development, creating a synergistic relationship between our media and merchandise divisions. We believe this acquisition will deliver solid returns for years to come and generate significant value for our shareholders. Bringing Jordan Schur on board as an advisor is a major advantage for SRM as his decades of experience in the film industry, including his roles at Suretone Pictures and Mimran Schur Pictures, will be invaluable as we build our media division,” adds Miller.\n\n“I’m honored to be part of this exciting new chapter of SRM Media as we endeavor to bring Suretone Pictures various filmed content, library assets and present / future IP in an integrated fashion to SRM Entertainment,” says Schur. “The addition of ‘The Kid’ is a strong first step in our plans to expand SRM Media as it demonstrates a clear vision for the future activities of a natural exchange of commerce in both companies. By combining Suretone’s filmmaking expertise and endeavors with SRM’s business acumen, we are building a media powerhouse that will deliver compelling entertainment experiences and potential revenue drivers in various verticals for years to come. The launch of SRM Media with Suretone Pictures committed assistance represents a significant milestone in SRM Entertainment’s growth strategy towards expanding its media footprint. Suretone Pictures plans to continue making great efforts in its guidance for SRM towards its goal objectives to scale and build its media library through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, further solidifying its position in the entertainment industry, while also emboldening the growing partnership of Suretone Pictures and SRM Entertainment.”\n\nThis move comes amidst a resurgence of interest in Western films, with demand growing by 146% in the US between 2021 and 2023, according to Parrot Analytics. With “The Kid,” SRM Media is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and the growing importance of digital media in consumers’ lives. \n\nAs Miller notes, citing data from eMarketer, “Adults in the US now spend an average of 7 hours and 50 minutes per day consuming digital media, presenting a significant opportunity for streaming platforms like Amazon, where ‘The Kid’ will be available. SRM Media will leverage its established merchandising and licensing expertise to maximize the film’s value in a global entertainment merchandise market expected to reach $480.97 billion by 2028, according to Statista.”\n\nMiller adds, referencing the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, “With US households spending an average of $3,433 per year on entertainment, there’s a clear demand for engaging content like ‘The Kid.’ This acquisition under the guidance of Suretone Pictures positions SRM Media to tap into this lucrative market and deliver strong returns for shareholders. Having digital media as part of SRM’s portfolio of products should help deliver sizable growth in the near future.”\n\nAmazon has over 200 million Amazon Prime subscribers worldwide. This number has doubled since 2018. In the US alone, there are approximately 180 million Amazon Prime subscribers. This means that roughly 75% of all US Amazon shoppers are Prime members.\n\n**About SRM Entertainment, Inc.**\n\nSRM Entertainment designs, develops, and manufactures custom merchandise which includes toys and souvenirs for the world’s largest theme parks and other entertainment venues.

The initial transaction was closed on September 3, 2024 with the transfer of the first of several valuable film assets transferred by Suretone Pictures to SRM. SRM and Suretone Entertainment’s Suretone Pictures are engaged in far-reaching discussions to jointly create a new media company using certain assets of Suretone Pictures as the two companies intend to come together to build a multi-film asset and IP based library with an innovative plan towards distribution, merchandising and production. \n\nThe companies have set an agenda with a goal to merge Suretone Pictures’ assets into SRM in early to mid 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Jordan Schur, Suretone Pictures’ President, will initially join SRM as an advisor bringing several decades of movie and media experience to lead the endeavor as he looks to manage jointly controlled movie assets and content creation to drive the strategic media combination forward. Schur will guide the venture as he oversees various film-making endeavors, as well as spearhead movie acquisition and related merchandising efforts for the companies with Suretone Pictures’ film and tv industries partners.\n\nSRM and Suretone Entertainment recently completed their first media deal with SRM acquiring certain Suretone Pictures film assets. Under the agreement, these initial assets will become part of SRM’s media library, allowing SRM to own and exploit the initial film assets’ merchandising, licensing fees and revenue. SRM and Suretone view this transaction as the first stage in an overall larger transaction to join forces toward creating a valuable media franchise business. Further announcements on subsequent stages are expected shortly.\n\nJordan Schur commented, “I am pleased to announce this new endeavor of Suretone Pictures with SRM. The companies enjoy a powerful synergy together on current functions which complement overall goals on a combined agenda in operations to better compete in the current environment. I look forward to working with Rich Miller and the SRM team on our jointly controlled IP to bring in-demand entertainment content in films, tv and physical goods to an underserved independent global film and tv market.”\n\nJordan Schur, founder and chairman of Suretone Entertainment, serves as Suretone Picture’s President and enjoys a long-standing successful career as a media entrepreneur. Schur additionally co-founded Mimran Schur Pictures, a company engaged in the co-finance of partnering with major film studios on their film productions. Schur has been a major force in the music business as founder of the legendary Flip Records, while also serving as long-time President of Geffen Records, additionally merging MCA Records into Geffen during his tenure there.\n\nSchur founded Los Angeles-based Suretone Entertainment in 2006 as an independent full-service entertainment company which has consistently impacted culture in music, film, and television. Suretone Entertainment encompasses Suretone Records, Suretone Pictures, and Suretone Management, a multi-tiered company that has become a prominent figure in the landscape of the entertainment industries. Schur has played a pivotal role at several of the major film studios and major record companies since the early 2000s, variously driving market leading profitability in his ventures alongside major industry partners while jointly creating defining movements in entertainment culture with some of the more influential figures in film, music and Hollywood. \n\nSRM is engaged in the business of creating themed merchandise based on blockbuster movie franchises in providing services to the film industry. The new relationship with Suretone Pictures allows SRM to expand its activities in obtaining valuable proprietary movie and media assets that will create new opportunity in its existing business manufacturing lines.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Jordan Schur and Suretone Pictures to SRM. Our goal is to jointly scale a disruptive film, tv, media company with on-going production operations, while building a library of film and tv assets, coupled with other valuable IP we plan to jointly acquire. We believe we enjoy a competitive edge in our plans to develop and distribute our various entertainment content and physical goods in our joint efforts direct to consumers through our various distribution channels online, in theaters, VOD and streaming, while manufacturing goods to properly exploit the various merchandise rights ensconced in the media rights.
