(Company or ArriVent) (Nasdaq: AVBP), a clinical-stage company dedicated to accelerating the global development of innovative biopharmaceutical therapeutics, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent Company progress.\n\n“Our lead clinical program of firmonertinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is strongly advancing with encouraging potential to expand across EGFR mutant types. In September, we announced compelling monotherapy data for firmonertinib from our FURTHER study supporting rapid and robust anti-tumor activity across EGFR PACC mutations building on the strong activity observed in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations,” said Bing Yao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ArriVent. “Importantly, the high activity in tough to treat patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases or compound mutations points to firmonertinib as a promising candidate for front-line patients with PACC mutations. Collectively, the broad activity in EGFR PACC mutations, the high responses in the CNS, and consistent, manageable safety profile across trials reinforces the promise firmonertinib holds to address unmet needs across the spectrum of EGFR mutant NSCLC.”\n\nDr. Yao continued, “We expect several near-term catalysts for our firmonertinib program including initiating dose expansion for the combination study in classical EGFR mutant NSCLC with SHP2 inhibitor ICP-189 in the fourth quarter of the year, an update on the Phase 1b PACC study and plans for our potential registration study in the first half of 2025, and topline pivotal data from our global Phase 3 FURVENT study in front-line EGFR exon 20 mutant NSCLC in 2025. With our strong balance sheet and operating runway into 2026, we are well-positioned to execute across our near-term catalysts.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n**Firmonertinib**\n\n  * **Positive proof-of-concept data in EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC.** In September, ArriVent presented interim FURTHER Phase 1b clinical data for first-line firmonertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC during the Presidential Symposium at the 2024 annual World Conference on Lung Cancer and hosted a virtual webinar. In what we believe to be the first clinical dataset testing an EGFR inhibitor in a randomized defined population of EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC, firmonertinib demonstrated robust systemic and CNS anti-tumor activity with a manageable safety profile consistent with previous trials.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * **Dose expansion for SHP2 inhibitor combination.** Initiation of dose expansion cohort for the ongoing Phase 1b trial evaluating firmonertinib in combination with SHP2 inhibitor ICP-189 by InnoCare in patients with classical EGFR mutations expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * **EGFR PACC pivotal study plan.** Data from the FURTHER Phase 1b (NCT05364043) trial continues to mature for first-line firmonertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC. ArriVent expects to provide an update on EGFR PACC plans in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n  * **Selection of next-generation antibody drug conjugate (ADC) candidate.** ArriVent and its partner, Aarvik Therapeutics, Inc., continue to make progress, including initiating CMC activities, on selecting a multi-target multivalent ADC candidate for the treatment of solid tumors in the ARR-002 program, and expect to complete selection of a candidate that will be advanced into IND enabling studies in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\n  * **Top-line pivotal Phase 3 data in 2025.** Firmonertinib is currently being studied as a monotherapy in the pivotal, global Phase 3 FURVENT trial (NCT05607550) evaluating firmonertinib in previously untreated NSCLC patients whose tumors contain EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations with topline data expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $282.9 million, which is expected to fund operations into 2026. Net cash used in operations was $54.1 million and $40.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n  * Research and development expenses were $58.9 million and $44.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to increased headcount and clinical expense related to firmonertinib.\n\n\n  * General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million and $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to expenses related to expanding the infrastructure necessary for operating as a public company.\n\n\n  * Net loss was $59.9 million and $48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About ArriVent**\n\nArriVent is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development, and commercialization of differentiated medicines to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancers. ArriVent seeks to utilize its team’s deep drug development experience to maximize the potential of its lead development candidate, firmonertinib, and advance a pipeline of novel therapeutics, such as next-generation antibody drug conjugates, through approval and commercialization.\n\n**About****Firmo****nertinib**\n\nFirmonertinib (formerly furmonertinib) is an oral, highly brain-penetrant, and broadly active mutation-selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor active against both classical and uncommon EGFR mutations, including PACC and exon 20 insertion mutations. In March 2021, firmonertinib was approved in China for first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations and for patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation, otherwise known as EGFR classical mutations.\n\nFirmonertinib was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Firmonertinib was also granted U.S. FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR mutations or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations or HER4 mutations.\n\nFirmonertinib is currently being studied in a global Phase 3 trial for first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (FURVENT; NCT05607550) and in a global Phase 1b study, which includes a cohort evaluating firmonertinib in patients with EGFR PACC mutations (FURTHER; NCT05364043). In addition, firmonertinib is also being studied in a clinical combination study targeting advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR classical mutations, in partnership with Beijing InnoCare Pharma Tech Co., Ltd.\n\n**About EGFR mutant NSCLC**\n\nGlobally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women. NSCLC is the predominant subtype of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. Mutational activation of the EGFR is a frequent and early event in the development of NSCLC. EGFR mutations are divided into classical and uncommon. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are a group of uncommon EGFR mutations and constitute approximately 9% of all EGFR mutations. PACC mutations are another group of uncommon EGFR mutations and represent approximately 12% of all EGFR mutations. Patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbor uncommon EGFR mutations have significantly lower life expectancy with available therapies and represent an area of unmet medical need.\n\n**About EGFR PACC mutations**\n\nP-loop and αC-helix compressing (PACC) EGFR mutations are a distinct set of approximately 70 mostly missense activating mutations within the kinase domain of EGFR. They are similar to Exon 20 insertion mutations in narrowing the drug binding pocket to affect tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity. PACC mutations are diagnosed through commercially available NGS and most PCR tests. Patients with PACC mutations have limited treatment options, and there is no broadly utilized standard of care treatment for first-line PACC mutant patients.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes certain disclosures that contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, cash runway, estimates of our addressable market, activity of firmonertinib compared to available therapies, anticipated clinical milestones, including dose expansion of ICP-189 in combination with firmonertinib, the study plan for a pivotal study of firmonertinib in patients with NSCLC EGFR PACC mutations, top-line pivotal Phase 3 data for firmonertinib in previously untreated NSCLC patients whose tumors contain EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, and the selection of an ADC clinical candidate, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.

Importantly, these data add to the clinical body of evidence supporting firmonertinib as a potentially effective option across EGFR mutation types and lines of non-small cell lung cancer therapy.”\n\nDr. Xiuning Le, Associate Professor of Thoracic Head and Neck Medical Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center and the lead Principal Investigator added, “Treating lung cancer patients with EGFR uncommon mutation lung cancer, including PACC mutations and Exon 20 insertion mutations, remains a clinical challenge, as we need more potent and better tolerated EGFR inhibitors. These encouraging randomized data for firmonertinib suggest rapid and robust anti-tumor activity across PACC mutations which is similar to that observed for firmonertinib in exon 20 insertions. Moreover, the apparent high CNS activity points to firmonertinib as a promising potential new therapy for frontline patients with PACC mutations including those with CNS disease.”\n\n**Presidential Symposium Presentation Highlights** Current standards of care have improved outcomes for classical EGFR mutations but have been less effective against uncommon EGFR mutation types including PACC and Exon 20 insertion mutations which represent approximately 12% and 9% of NSCLC EGFR mutations, respectively. Firmonertinib, an oral, once-daily, highly brain-penetrant EGFR inhibitor with broad activity across EGFR mutations, was evaluated for interim clinical proof-of-concept data in first-line EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC as part of the Phase 1b FURTHER trial. **Select clinical activity and safety results from FURTHER interim data analysis include:**\n\n  * First clinical dataset from an EGFR inhibitor being tested in a randomized defined population of EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC\n  * Robust systemic and central nervous system (CNS) responses across patients observed as of June 20, 2024 (data cut): \n    * 81.8% at 240mg and 47.8% at 160mg overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR)\n    * 63.6% and 34.8% confirmed ORR by BICR at 240mg and 160mg dose levels, respectively. One unconfirmed partial response pending confirmation at each of the 160mg and 240mg dose levels.\n    * Median duration of response had not yet been reached; 90.9% (n = 20/22) patients with confirmed responses remain on study\n    * 46.2% (n = 6/13) CNS confirmed ORR by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by BICR in first-line patients with brain metastases at baseline\n  * Generally well-tolerated with a profile consistent with prior firmonertinib data \n    * Most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, stomatitis, and hepatic enzyme elevation\n    * No treatment discontinuation due to TRAEs was observed\n  * Firmonertinib showed promising dose-dependent activity in NSCLC patients across a broad range of EGFR PACC mutations in the first-line metastatic setting and includes CNS antitumor activity consistent with its high brain penetrance.\n\n\n\n**About ArriVent** ArriVent is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development, and commercialization of differentiated medicines to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancers.

Dr. Hohneker brings over 30 years of experience in biopharmaceutical leadership and drug development, previously serving as President and CEO of Anokion SA and holding leadership roles at Forma Therapeutics and Novartis AG. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Carisma Therapeutics and Curis, and private companies Sonata Therapeutics and Trishula Therapeutics. Dr. Hohneker serves on ArriVent’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee. In April 2024, ArriVent appointed Kristine Peterson to its Board of Directors. Ms. Peterson has served on the boards of multiple public biopharmaceutical companies, including Immunocore and ImmunoGen (recently acquired by Abbvie), and brings over 30 years of industry leadership experience having previously served as CEO of Valeritas and Company Group Chair of Johnson and Johnson for their worldwide biotech and oncology groups. Ms. Peterson serves on ArriVent’s Compensation Committee.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * As of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $298.7 million, which is expected to fund operations into 2026. Net cash used in operations was $37.7 million and $25.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n  * Research and development expenses were $38.8 million and $30.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to increased headcount and clinical expense related to firmonertinib.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $7.6 million and $4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to expenses related to expanding the infrastructure necessary for operating as a public company.\n  * Net loss was $39.3 million and $33.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About ArriVent** ArriVent is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development, and commercialization of differentiated medicines to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancers. ArriVent seeks to utilize its team’s deep drug development experience to maximize the potential of its lead development candidate, firmonertinib, and advance a pipeline of novel therapeutics, such as next-generation antibody drug conjugates, through approval and commercialization.\n\n**About****Firmo****nertinib** Firmonertinib (formerly furmonertinib) is an oral, highly brain-penetrant, and broadly active mutation-selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor active against both classical and uncommon EGFR mutations, including PACC and exon 20 insertion mutations. In March 2021, firmonertinib was approved in China for first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations and for patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation, otherwise known as EGFR classical mutations.\n\nFirmonertinib was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Firmonertinib was also granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations or HER4 mutations.\n\nFirmonertinib is currently being studied in a global Phase 3 trial for first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (FURVENT; NCT05607550) and in a global Phase 1b study, which includes a cohort evaluating firmonertinib in patients with EGFR PACC mutations (FURTHER; NCT05364043). In addition, firmonertinib is also being studied in a clinical combination study targeting advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR classical mutations, in partnership with Beijing InnoCare Pharma Tech Co., Ltd.\n\n**About EGFR mutant NSCLC** Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women. NSCLC is the predominant subtype of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. Mutational activation of the EGFR is a frequent and early event in the development of NSCLC. EGFR mutations are divided into classical and uncommon. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are a group of uncommon EGFR mutations and constitute approximately 9% of all EGFR mutations. PACC mutations are another group of uncommon EGFR mutations and represent approximately 12% of all EGFR mutations. Patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbor uncommon EGFR mutations have significantly lower life expectancy with available therapies and represent an area of unmet medical need.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release includes certain disclosures that contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
