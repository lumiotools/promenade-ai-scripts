(“NEXGEL” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: “NXGL”), a leading provider of ultra-gentle, high-water-content hydrogel products for healthcare and consumer applications, today announced record third quarter revenue of $2.94 million, an increase of 141% year-over-year and 104% sequentially.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Net Revenue was $2.94 million, compared to $1.22 million in Q3 2023 and $1.44 million in Q2 2024.\n  * Gross Profit Margin was 43.6%, compared to 28.2% in Q3 2023 and 28.5% in Q2 2024.\n  * Net loss was $754,000, compared to $552,000 in Q3 2023 and $979,000 in Q2 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $347,000 in Q3 2024, compared to $464,000 in Q3 2023 and $788,000 in Q2 2024.\n  * Cash as of September 30, 2024, was $1.10 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company closed on a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of $2 million. \n\n\n\n“The third quarter was yet another record quarter for the Company across all our key financial measures. Revenue increased 141% year-over-year and 104% sequentially, while gross margins were 43.6% and our Non-GAAP EBITDA loss improved to $347,000. Our significant growth was driven by approximately 100% sequential growth in both branded consumer products and contract manufacturing,” Adam Levy, NEXGEL’s Chief Executive Officer, commented. “As we head into the holiday season, we expect our year-over-year and sequential revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter and our quarterly Non-GAAP EBITDA loss to narrow even further. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, our first orders of SilverSeal® to Cintas will occur. To meet the high demand we are seeing, subsequent to the third quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet with the closing of $2 million in gross proceeds from a registered direct offering.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, revenue totaled $2.94 million, an increase of 141%, as compared to the third quarter 2023, and an increase of 104%, as compared to the second quarter 2024. The increase year-over-year and sequentially in overall revenues was primarily due to sales growth in branded consumer products and contract manufacturing.\n\nGross profit totaled $1.3 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to a gross profit of $344,000 for the third quarter 2023 and gross profit of $410,000 for the second quarter 2024. The increase of $956,000 in gross profit year-over-year was primarily due to the increase in branded consumer products. The increase of $890,000 in gross profit sequentially was primarily due to the increase in branded consumer products and contract manufacturing.\n\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 43.6% compared to a gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 of 28.2% and a gross profit margin of 28.5% for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nCost of revenues increased by $781,000, or 89.1%, to $1.66 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $877,000 for the third quarter 2023. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily aligned with sales of branded consumer products, as both Silly George and Kenkoderm were acquired after the comparable 2023 period.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.12 million, or approximately 118%, to $2.1 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $950,000 for the third quarter 2023. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to advertising, marketing, and Amazon fees, which increased $819,000.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, was approximately $347,000 as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $464,000 for the third quarter of 2023 and $788,000 for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter 2024 was $754,000 as compared to a net loss of $552,000 for the third quarter 2023, and a net loss of $979,000 for the second quarter 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $1.1 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company closed on a registered direct offering of $2 million. The use of proceeds for the financing is for working capital and the immediate requirement for additional inventory and marketing to meet the higher-than-expected demand for the Silly George brand products.\n\nAs of November 13, 2024, NEXGEL had 6,790,777 shares of common stock outstanding, which number does not include the 727,272 shares of common stock we anticipate issuing in connection with our recent offering.\n\n1. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure at the end of this release.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call****Date:** November 13, 2024**Time:** 4:30 P.M.

In the calculation of these measures, the Company excludes certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, tax impact of adjustments, other unusual items and discrete items impacting income tax expense.

The release and the attachments to this release provide a reconciliation of each of the Non-GAAP measures referred to in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered a substitute for the corresponding GAAP financial statements and investors should evaluate them carefully.

(“NEXGEL” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: “NXGL”), a leading provider of ultra-gentle, high-water-content hydrogel products for healthcare and consumer applications, today announced record third quarter revenue of $2.94 million, an increase of 141% year-over-year and 104% sequentially.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Net Revenue was $2.94 million, compared to $1.22 million in Q3 2023 and $1.44 million in Q2 2024.\n  * Gross Profit Margin was 43.6%, compared to 28.2% in Q3 2023 and 28.5% in Q2 2024.\n  * Net loss was $754,000, compared to $552,000 in Q3 2023 and $979,000 in Q2 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $347,000 in Q3 2024, compared to $464,000 in Q3 2023 and $788,000 in Q2 2024.\n  * Cash as of September 30, 2024, was $1.10 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company closed on a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of $2 million. \n\n\n\n“The third quarter was yet another record quarter for the Company across all our key financial measures. Revenue increased 141% year-over-year and 104% sequentially, while gross margins were 43.6% and our Non-GAAP EBITDA loss improved to $347,000. Our significant growth was driven by approximately 100% sequential growth in both branded consumer products and contract manufacturing,” Adam Levy, NEXGEL’s Chief Executive Officer, commented. “As we head into the holiday season, we expect our year-over-year and sequential revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter and our quarterly Non-GAAP EBITDA loss to narrow even further. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, our first orders of SilverSeal® to Cintas will occur. To meet the high demand we are seeing, subsequent to the third quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet with the closing of $2 million in gross proceeds from a registered direct offering.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, revenue totaled $2.94 million, an increase of 141%, as compared to the third quarter 2023, and an increase of 104%, as compared to the second quarter 2024. The increase year-over-year and sequentially in overall revenues was primarily due to sales growth in branded consumer products and contract manufacturing.\n\nGross profit totaled $1.3 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to a gross profit of $344,000 for the third quarter 2023 and gross profit of $410,000 for the second quarter 2024. The increase of $956,000 in gross profit year-over-year was primarily due to the increase in branded consumer products. The increase of $890,000 in gross profit sequentially was primarily due to the increase in branded consumer products and contract manufacturing.\n\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 43.6% compared to a gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 of 28.2% and a gross profit margin of 28.5% for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nCost of revenues increased by $781,000, or 89.1%, to $1.66 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $877,000 for the third quarter 2023. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily aligned with sales of branded consumer products, as both Silly George and Kenkoderm were acquired after the comparable 2023 period.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.12 million, or approximately 118%, to $2.1 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $950,000 for the third quarter 2023. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to advertising, marketing, and Amazon fees, which increased $819,000.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, was approximately $347,000 as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $464,000 for the third quarter of 2023 and $788,000 for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter 2024 was $754,000 as compared to a net loss of $552,000 for the third quarter 2023, and a net loss of $979,000 for the second quarter 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $1.1 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company closed on a registered direct offering of $2 million.

Based in Langhorne, Pa., the Company has developed and manufactured electron-beam, cross-linked hydrogels for over two decades.

Additionally, NEXGEL has strategic contract manufacturing relationships with leading consumer healthcare companies.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCertain Non-GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. In the calculation of these measures, the Company excludes certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, tax impact of adjustments, other unusual items and discrete items impacting income tax expense. The Company believes that excluding such items provides investors and management with a representation of the Company's core operating performance and with information useful in assessing its prospects for the future and underlying trends in the Company's operating expenditures and continuing operations. Management uses such Non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial results and manage operations. The release and the attachments to this release provide a reconciliation of each of the Non-GAAP measures referred to in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered a substitute for the corresponding GAAP financial statements and investors should evaluate them carefully. These Non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statement**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (which Sections were adopted as part of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “prospects,” “outlook,” and similar words or expressions, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may,” and “could,” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, including, without limitation, our expectation that our year-over-year and sequential revenue growth will continue in the fourth quarter and our quarterly Non-GAAP EBITDA* loss will narrow even further as we head into the holidays.. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the Company's actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated results, performance, or achievements for many reasons. The Company disclaims any intention to, and undertakes no obligation to, revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, a future event, or otherwise. For additional risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's forward-looking statements, please see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including but not limited to the discussion under “Risk Factors” therein, which the Company filed with the SEC and which may be viewed at http://www.sec.gov/.\n\n**Investor Contacts:** Valter Pinto, Managing DirectorKCSA Strategic Communications212.896.1254[Nexgel@kcsa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IVZ9lc-fBusS3DYhHG_-BMo3FUKW-Tkxnnu8KTvkMGSV1jxYJSa0YZOQRj0VIUpyUxafbzQDlpteUAtSWm370w== \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n**NEXGEL, INC****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DECEMBER 31, 2023****(Unaudited)**_(in thousands, except share and per share data)_\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**ASSETS:**  \nCurrent Assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 1,059 | $ | 2,700  \nAccounts receivable, net | 894 | 633  \nInventory | 1,778 | 1,319  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 879 | 400  \nTotal current assets | 4,610 | 5,052  \nGoodwill | 1,124 | 1,128  \nIntangibles, net | 839 | 326  \nProperty and equipment, net | 2,219 | 1,499  \nOperating lease -
