In addition, throughout this Presentation a range of financial and non-financial measures are used to assess the Company’s performance, including a number of the\nfinancial measures that are not defined under IFRS, which are termed “Alternative Performance Measures” (“APMs”). Management uses these measures to monitor the Company’s financial performance alongside IFRS measures because\nthey help illustrate the underlying financial performance and position of the Group. These APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash\nflows reported in accordance with IFRS. APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, such measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other\ncompanies.\n2\nToday’s Presenters\nMarc Fielmann Steffen Bätjer Nils Scharwächter\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Interim IR Manager\n• Joined Fielmann in 2012 • Joined Fielmann in August 2023 • 5+ years experience at Fielmann across\nseveral positions\n• 13+ years industry experience (Luxottica, • 15+ years of transformation and M&A\nSafilo, Fielmann), CEO since 2019 experience • 2 years as equity research analyst\n• Family principal & majority shareholder • Previous global CFO in private equity and\ncorporate services businesses, corporate\nbanking, and McKinsey\n3\nOur Market: >$80 Bn Growing TAM, Supported by Favorable Demographic & Lifestyle Tailwinds\nProviding Vision Care & Acoustics Solutions for a Population Increasingly Afflicted by Visual & Hearing Impairments (Ageing & Lifestyle)\nOPTICAL AND HEARING AIDS MARKETS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE KEY DRIVERS\nTO GROW AHEAD OF BROADER GDP GROWTH\n2023-28E CAGRs (%)(1)\nIncreasing myopia among younger\ngenerations\nAgeing population\nOptical market 2.9%\nTAM(2)\nFashionable eyewear increasing adoption\n$80 Bn+\nRising screens and earphones usage\nHearing Aids Market 4.2%\nTechnology is de-stigmatizing hearing aids\n(e.g. Apple AirPods)\nNon-discretionary healthcare solutions with\nstable replacement cycles (insurance)\nSources: Company Information, Market Research Reports, Euromonitor, Fitch\nNotes:\n1) CAGRs for Optical and Hearing Aids markets across DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and USA\n2) TAM = Total Addressable market: Germany (incl. hearing aids), Austria, Switzerland, Spain and USA (excl. hearing aids for all markets other than Germany)\n4\nOur Purpose\nImproving Accessibility and Affordability of Vision and Hearing Solutions\nWe help EVERYONE hear and see\nthe beauty in the world\n5\nOur Snapshot: Global Vision Care & Acoustics Business with Leading Growth & Return Profile\nIndustry Leading Customer Satisfaction and Retention Rates Secure Steady Organic Growth\n29 MM c.24,000 1,234 >9 MM\nCustomers Employees Stores Rx glasses\n€\n90% 90% >€2.2 Bn 9.5%\nCustomer Satisfaction Customer Retention LTM Sep-24 Revenue Revenue CAGR since Jun-21\n>€430 MM €0.7 Bn €1.2 Bn 24%\nLTM Sep-24 EBITDA invested in M&A returned to shareholders annualized TSR over L2Y\n(>20% margin)(1) (5 acquisitions) since 2019 since January 2014\n#1 in Major European Markets, #3 Worldwide\nSources: Company Information.

Despite the challenging economic environ-\nment in our core European markets, the Fielmann Group continued its growth tra-\njectory, both in top line growth as well as EBITDA expansion.\nIn addition, we are now offering our innovative new primary eye health care ser-\nvice in about 400 stores in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. This service has so\nfar been used by more than 70,000 customers and will be rolled out further across\nselected other European markets. In total, the Fielmann Group provided primary\neye health care services to over 675 thousand people in the first nine months of\n2024 in the United States and Europe.\nIn furtherance of the internationalization of our business in line with Vision 2025,\nwe successfully closed another acquisition on July 1, 2024. Through the acquisi-\ntion of Shopko Optical we continue to expand our network in the United States.\nWith a market leading position in the Upper Midwest, the Fielmann Group rein-\nforces its position in the largest optical market in the world.\nUnit sales\nIn the first nine months of the year, the Fielmann Group's eyewear sales increased\nby +2.6% yoy (year-on-year) to a total of 6.8 million pairs of glasses. Hearing\naids were up by +7.5% yoy to 95k (9M/2023: 6.6 million pairs of glasses; 89k\nhearing aids).\n1 Total consolidated sales are defined as total sales incl. changes in inventory\n3 Third quarter 2024\nSales revenue\nIn the first nine months of the year, total consolidated group sales increased by\n+12.7% to €1,692 million (9M/2023: €1,501 million), of which +4.9% was at-\ntributable to organic growth and +7.8% was driven by our US acquisitions.\nGermany, our largest market by sales, recorded strong organic growth of +4.6%\ndespite a persistently challenging market environment. Our international markets\noutperformed once again, increasing their sales in 9M/2024 by +32.3% yoy.\nSwitzerland and Austria improved +5.0% and +8.7%, and Spain and Poland\ngrew significantly at +9.9% and +31.1%, respectively. Our US business contributed\n€127 million to group sales and, at full-year sales of over €250 million, is our\nsecond-largest market. As a result, for the first nine months of 2024, 35.7% of\ngroup sales were attributable to our international markets. In the corresponding\nprior-year period, this share stood at 30.4%.\nAs at September 30, the Fielmann Group operated 1,234 stores (September 30,\n2023: 1,075), of which 402 included hearing aid studios (September 30, 2023:\n379). Our US business now comprises 227 stores, of which 145 were integrated\ninto the Fielmann Group as part of the Shopko Optical acquisition.\nAdjusted Earnings\nThe Fielmann Group continued on its profitable growth trajectory and increased\nadjusted EBITDA by +12.9% to €379 million in 9M/2024 (9M/2023: €336 mil-\nlion). Our adjusted EBITDA margin in Europe increased to 23.6% (9M/2023:\n22.5%) thanks to an improved product mix as well as rigorous cost management.\nOur US business started at a significantly lower base than our European business\nand reached an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3%. This is in line with expectations\nand on route to our full-year guidance of a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin for our US\nactivities. The integration and synergy realization in our US operations progress\nwell. The Group's overall adjusted EBITDA margin remained stable at 22.4%.\nThe Group's gross profit margin continued to benefit from a favorable product\nmix and improved by 0.8 percentage points yoy to 79.6%. Our personnel ex-\npenses increased by +12.6% to €725 million (9M/2023 €644 million), driven by\nsalary increases in Europe at the beginning of the year and the addition of Shopko\nOptical's employees to our business. The personnel cost ratio stood at 42.9%,\nwhich is the same as the prior year's figure. As of the reporting date, the Fielmann\nGroup employed 24,673 people. More than 1,800 of these employees work in\nour rapidly growing US business.\nAdjusted EBT amounted to €206 million (9M/2023: €179 million), an increase of\n+15.1% compared to the previous year. Accordingly, adjusted EBT margin showed\na yoy increase of 0.3 percentage points to 12.2% (9M/2023: 11.9%).\nThird quarter 2024 4\nQ3/2024\nIn the third quarter, Fielmann recorded total consolidated sales of €601 million,\nup 15.3% from the corresponding prior-year period (€521 million), of which\n37.7% was attributable to our international markets (Q3/2023: 30.6%). In the\nsame period, adjusted EBITDA amounted to €142 million, which corresponds to\nan increase of +8.8% yoy. The adjusted EBITDA margin at group level was 23.6%.\nThe adjusted EBT also developed positively and, at €78 million, was +9.5% above\nthe corresponding prior-year period (€71 million).\nAdjustments\nThe Fielmann Group introduced adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBT as additional\nkey performance indicators in its half-year report 2024. Extraordinary effects are\neliminated from EBITDA and EBT in order to report the Group's sustainable prof-\nitability.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of the reported key figures to the\nnewly introduced adjusted key performance indicators .\n2024 2023\nFor the period from January 1 to September 30 in € m in € m\nEBITDA 360.9 338.6\nI.

Acquisition-/Integration-related costs:\nThe adjustments in 2024 relate to transaction, integration, and restructuring ex-\npenses with respect to the acquisition of Shopko Optical. In 2023, we recorded\ntransaction expenses regarding our acquisitions of SVS Vision and befitting,\namounting to €2.3 million and accrued €1.2 million for a potential pre-acquisition\nobligation to repay COVID subsidies in Spain in connection with the business we\nacquired in 2020.\nII. Impairment charges:\nThere are no impairment losses in either period to adjust.\n5 Third quarter 2024\nIII. Reorganization costs:\nThis item includes exceptional, non-recurring costs incurred as a result of internal\nreorganization, which are mainly expenses related to personnel measures or ex-\npenses for site closures. In 2024, severance payments were recognized for the\nreorganization of the finance division. In the corresponding prior-year period, the\nadjustments related to termination payments in connection with our cost leader-\nship program.\nIV. Other non-recurring income/costs:\nThe adjustments of €10.5 million reported for 9M/2024 include extraordinary\nincome from the partial sale of our FittingBox S.A. investment (€2.5 million).\nOn the other hand, we recorded a €13.0 million accrual for expected personnel\nexpenses (consisting of wage tax and social security payments) in relation to prior\nyears. In the corresponding prior-year period, we adjusted downwards for the\nreceipt of a lump sum, multi-year payment for our acoustics business (€5.0 million)\nand the correction to the cost of materials relating to 2022 (€6.8 million).\nThe adjusted EBT represents earnings before taxes, adjusted for the abovemen-\ntioned extraordinary effects eliminated in the context of the adjusted EBITDA,\nplus further one-off effects that only affect EBT.\n2024 2023\nFor the period from January 1 to September 30 in € m in € m\nEBT 187.3 173.1\nI.

In the first nine months of the previous year, the re-\nported EBT included an impairment charge of €12.0 million resulting from the then\nplanned closure of stores in Italy. In addition, with effect from the fourth quarter\nof 2023, the profit contributions paid to our franchise partners were reclassified\nfrom below net profit to financial results. In order to provide for a comparable\nThird quarter 2024 6\nbasis, we adjusted the 2023 figures accordingly (IV. Other non-recurring (in-\ncome)/costs). From Q4/2024, the presentation will be consistent between the\nreporting period and the comparative period, which is why the adjustment of this\nitem will no longer be necessary.\nFinancial position\nThe main effect on the development of our financial assets was the successful com-\npletion of the acquisition of Shopko Optical, the largest transaction in the com-\npany's history (purchase price payment: US$287.5 million, financed through a\nshort-term Acquisition Bridge Facility). In addition, the dividend of €84.0 million\n(corresponding to €1.00 per share2) for the financial year 2023 was approved by\nthe Annual General Meeting of the Fielmann Group AG on July 11, 2024 and sub-\nsequently distributed to the shareholders during the third quarter.\nForecast, opportunities and risk report, and outlook\nThe statements made in the 2023 Annual Financial Report regarding the oppor-\ntunities and risks of the business model remain unchanged.

          "content": "INTERIM STATEMENT\nAS AT 31 MARCH 2024\n2 First Quarter 2024\nFielmann Group: Interim report\nas at 31 March 2024\n• 10.8% sales growth in Q1/2024\n• EBITDA increases by 10.5%, EBT by 6.5%\n• FY2024 forecast envisages double-digit topline growth, increases in\nboth EBITDA and EBT\nDear shareholders and friends of the company,\nIn the beginning of 2024, a weak consumer sentiment, particularly in Germany,\naffected our business growth in Europe whereas a positive environment combined\nwith an effective execution of our growth levers saw our US business contributing\nstrongly.\nFinancial performance Q1/2024\nIn the first quarter of 2024, consolidated Fielmann Group sales increased by\n+10.8% to €529.1 million (previous year: €477.7 million). While our US business\nadded €30.3 million in sales during the first quarter, our European business grew\n+4.4% over Q1/2023.\nGermany reached a growth rate of +2.7% over last year, Switzerland recorded\nsales growth of +4.2% over the same period last year. Austria improved +9.0%\nand Spain went up +9,8 over Q1/2023. Poland – once again – stood out with\n+36% growth over last year.\nOur Q1/2024 performance in Europe is to be viewed with hard Q1/2023 com-\nparables in mind (a one-off insurance reimbursement for hearing aid repairs in\nGermany and the 2023 Easter holidays were in Q2 rather than Q1).\nIn the first three months of the year, the cost of materials increased by +8.3% to\n€107.8 million (previous year: €99.6 million), while the gross profit margin im-\nproved by 0.5 percentage points to 20.1%. Personnel expenses increased by\n+8.0% to a total of €237.6 million (previous year: €220.0 million). The cost/\nincome ratio fell by 1.2 percentage points to 44.3%. The number of employees\nrose by 628 in the first three months. As at the reporting date, the Fielmann Group\nemployed a total of 22,982 members of staff (previous year: 22,354). This\nincrease is mainly due to the Fielmann Group’s international expansion and,\nin particular, to the acquisition of SVS Vision in the USA.\nThe Fielmann Group increased EBITDA in Q1/2024 by +10.5% to €116.6 million\n(previous year: €105.5 million), with a stable margin of 21.7% after 21.8% in the\nprevious year. EBT improved by +6.5% to €62.1 million (previous year: €58.4 mil-\nlion), with a margin of 11.6 per cent (previous year: 12.1%).\nFirst Quarter 2024 3\nAt the beginning of the year, Fielmann significantly increased salaries for opti-\ncians and acousticians and is making use of a tax-credited bonus scheme availa-\nble to all employees in Germany.\nThe investments in tangible and intangible assets are related to the implementa-\ntion of our Vision 2025 growth strategy and amounted to €13.6 million after three\nmonths (previous year: €30.7 million).\nAs at 31 March, the Fielmann Group operated digital sales channels in almost all\nmarkets as well as 1.078 stores (previous year: 977), 393 of which also contained\nhearing-aid studios (previous year: 359).\nDividend\nThe Management and Supervisory Boards will recommend a dividend pay-out of\n€1.00 per share to the Annual General Meeting on 11 July 2024 (previous year:\n€0.75). Based on the year-end closing price, the dividend yield amounts to 2.1%.\nThe total dividend pay-out is €84 million (previous year: €63 million) and corre-\nsponds to a pay-out ratio of 66% (previous year: 61%) of the profits attributable\nto parent company shareholders.\nOutlook, forecast, opportunities and risk report\nIn an environment marked by political conflicts and low consumer confidence, the\nFielmann Group is well positioned: In times of crisis customers opt for providers\nthat offer guaranteed quality and excellent service at the best prices. In the opti-\ncal and acoustics industries, this is the Fielmann Group. Considering the constant\nexpansion of our omnichannel business model, our strong European core markets,\nand the contribution of our new acquisitions in North America, we expect a top-\nline expansion at around the growth rate we have experienced in 2023, resulting\nin net consolidated sales of about €2.2 billion in 2024 and around 9.2 million\npairs of glasses. As we diligently execute our Cost Leadership Program, we expect\na further increase in our profitability, leading to a similar or higher EBITDA margin\nas in 2023 and an improved EBT margin for 2024.
