The deal allowed Peter Beck's company to effectively reverse-list on the United States exchange as it backed into the slot already occupied by Vector - avoiding the need for a full prospectus and other costs and complications that come with a traditional IPO.\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [The Kiwi company making the Vaccine Pass - and how it could look and how it will work](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/covid-19-delta-outbreak-spark-subsidiary-mattr-wins-key-vaccine-pass-contract/WU3ABDBP5BDINVMITLHK5AI3GY/)\n\n\n\nIntegral is offering an Australasian firm the same shortcut to the Nasdaq, but has only just begun a process - expected to take months - of settling on a merger candidate.\n\nAdvertisement[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\nThe US-incorporated, Melbourne-based Integral is led by its chief executive EnriqueKlix, who has a hard-nosed corporate background (he's previously held executive roles with McKinsey and Citi), and its more touchy-feely chairman James Cotton - the self-styled \"impact entrepreneur\" and \"startup mentor\" who founded Uluwatu Capital (motto: \"Helping people and the planet\").\n\n## Keep up to date with the day's biggest stories\n\nSign up to our daily curated newsletter for the day's top stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease email me competitions, offers and other updates.

They are looking at potential merger prospects across the board, but the CEO said edtech, agtech and fintech are areas of special focus.\n\nAdvertisement[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\nThey're looking for a target that could list at a valuation of between US$300m - no longer an outrageous amount in the NZ market. It's seen three $1 billion-plus deals over the past 12 months with the $1.05b sale of Christchurch's Seequent to Nasdaq-listed Bentley systems, Rocket Lab's merger with Vector and subsequent listing at a US$5.4b valuation and $3b merger of the Murray Bolton-backed Transaction Services Group and Clearent to create Xpilor. And there have been many chunky deals on the next tier down, such as KKR buying into Dunedin-based Education Perfect in a deal that valued the ed-tech at $455m.\n\nLike all spacs, Integral is time-limited. Klix says it has 18 months on its clock, but he expects a deal well within that time, and for other, related spacs to follow (hence the \"1\" after Integral's name). He says the first effort hit the ground running, raising US$15m above its US$100m target with its over-subscribed listing, which was managed by Wells Fargo.\n\nWhy should an Australasian tech firm want to hook up with Integral rather than take the more traditional IPO route on its own?\n\n\"We're very founder-friendly,\" Klix says.\n\n\"We are not here to run a company. We'll take a seat on the board from a few months and then it will be over.\n\n\"And then there's combining around a Series C, D, E, and F [raises], all together in one go.\n\n\"So instead of doing multiple rounds, if you merge with us, you have access to US$150m or so all in one go, if necessary more.\n\n\"We're local. So we understand what the local entrepreneurs and the local VCs want.\n\nAdvertisement[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\n\"And it's a fast-track to the Nasdaq, and it's less distracting than a traditional IPO. If you're trying to run a business that's growing double digits, you don't have time to focus on the IPO process, which could be very time-consuming.\"\n\n## Allbirds left money on the table\n\nHis trump argument for turning to a spac involves a company co-founded by a Kiwi.\n\n\"Allbirds left money on the table,\" Klix says.\n\n\"They could have raised the same money by selling half the amount of equity.\"\n\nAllbirds [raised](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/ex-all-white-tim-brown-a-650m-man-as-allbirds-shares-soar-on-nasdaq-debut/ONFRX5CDYA32KHGHIUU7LFYFMI/) just over US300m as it listed at US$15 per share, but topped US$31 during its first session.\n\nThe Financial Times said last month that \" spacs, which were the hottest product on Wall Street earlier this year, have fallen out of favour with investors\".\n\nThe paper cited Dealogic data that showed the average redemption rate during the third quarter was 52.4 per cent. That marked a significant increase from the first three months of the year when just 10 per cent of investors chose to redeem their cash and is up from 21.9 per cent in the previous quarter. High fees for some blank cheques have caused controversy, and there has been increasing scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor Klix, the greater attention from the SEC shows the spac market is maturing. He says he welcomes the extra scrutiny, which he says can give investors more confidence.\n\nAnd he says Integral is already lining up a potential partner (while a spac could in theory invest in more than one company, the CEO notes that \"99 per cent\" invest in a single target).\n\n\"We have a shortlist of companies that are super-attractive. We've already had a few conversations and we'll have more in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHe says NZ companies are capable, but also aware they need to marry upward.\n\n\"We like Kiwi entrepreneurs because of the number eight wire mentality. We think it's sensational,\" Klix said.\n\n\"But Kiwi entrepreneurs know from day one that they need to go global to justify investment in technology in good people. They know that their domestic market is very interesting, but has some size limitations.\"\n\nAnd while there is a booming venture capital scene in NZ, and the option of listing on the NZX or ASX, Klix says, \"We believe the Nasdaq represents a more natural home for high-growth tech startups looking to solve global problems, providing access to investors that understand their value, as well as appropriate benchmarks and a broader community of analysts focused on technology companies.\"\n\nGift article\n\n[Save](#)\n\nShare\n\n## Latest from Companies\n\n[Business](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/)|[companies](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/)\n\n### [FMA welcomes High Court decision on CBL02 Dec 09:52 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/fma-welcomes-high-court-decision-on-cbl/UBQ6D2Q62FEZBPHDD2E5NRSSHU/)\n\n[Construction](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/construction/)\n\n### [Govt wants users of new infrastructure squeezed before it opens its wallet02 Dec 09:40 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/construction/government-wants-users-of-new-infrastructure-to-pay-more-so-it-takes-out-less-debt/5NEL5VNJORH65CQXWWVYTASPMA/)\n\nPremium\n\n[Companies](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/)\n\n### [Former port CEO conviction has message for big company leaders, says law firm02 Dec 05:11 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/former-port-of-auckland-ceo-tony-gibsons-case-carries-lesson-for-big-company-leaders-says-law-firm/6UWWDGWDKNAPLOYR2RAXW4LPBA/)\n\n### [A Queenstown secret: why Walter Peak is a must-dine location](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sponsored-stories/a-queenstown-secret-why-walter-peak-is-a-must-dine-location/H6MM24IKEZCG3HCE4LT46KJPWE/)\n\n[sponsored](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sponsored-stories/)\n\nAdvertisement[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\n## Latest from Companies\n\n[![FMA welcomes High Court decision on CBL](/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_l.png?d=859)](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/fma-welcomes-high-court-decision-on-cbl/UBQ6D2Q62FEZBPHDD2E5NRSSHU/)\n\n### [FMA welcomes High Court decision on CBL02 Dec 09:52 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/fma-welcomes-high-court-decision-on-cbl/UBQ6D2Q62FEZBPHDD2E5NRSSHU/)\n\nThe FMA has welcomed a decision on the estate of former CBLC director Alistair Hutchison.\n\n[![Govt wants users of new infrastructure squeezed before it opens its wallet](/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_l.png?d=859)](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/construction/government-wants-users-of-new-infrastructure-to-pay-more-so-it-takes-out-less-debt/5NEL5VNJORH65CQXWWVYTASPMA/)\n\n### [Govt wants users of new infrastructure squeezed before it opens its wallet02 Dec 09:40 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/construction/government-wants-users-of-new-infrastructure-to-pay-more-so-it-takes-out-less-debt/5NEL5VNJORH65CQXWWVYTASPMA/)\n\nPremium\n\n[![Former port CEO conviction has message for big company leaders, says law firm](/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_l.png?d=859)](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/former-port-of-auckland-ceo-tony-gibsons-case-carries-lesson-for-big-company-leaders-says-law-firm/6UWWDGWDKNAPLOYR2RAXW4LPBA/)\n\n### [Former port CEO conviction has message for big company leaders, says law firm02 Dec 05:11 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/former-port-of-auckland-ceo-tony-gibsons-case-carries-lesson-for-big-company-leaders-says-law-firm/6UWWDGWDKNAPLOYR2RAXW4LPBA/)\n\nPremium\n\n[![Spotless NZ businesses sold in cleaning, catering shakeup](/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_l.png?d=859)](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/downer-edi-selling-spotless-businesses-to-ovation-hospitality/PFHNBGBF3ZA5NA6NN77YEH63Q4/)\n\n### [Spotless NZ businesses sold in cleaning, catering shakeup02 Dec 02:27 AM](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/downer-edi-selling-spotless-businesses-to-ovation-hospitality/PFHNBGBF3ZA5NA6NN77YEH63Q4/)\n\n[![Smart lending, local service](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/P5H3YX5YPJBQDC77AA5P56P4L4.jpg?auth=551bef2f86f9980e9e05a912ff05762f4eb583a39d19dc9a35201c3ba539d85d&width=620&height=349&quality=70&focal=655%2C521&smart=false)](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sponsored-stories/smart-lending-local-service/P2KZONSKJBEFHNHR2KMTQN5EEI/)\n\n[sponsored](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sponsored-stories/)\n\n### [Smart lending, local service](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sponsored-stories/smart-lending-local-service/P2KZONSKJBEFHNHR2KMTQN5EEI/)\n\nTOP\n\n[search by queryly ](https://www.queryly.com/) Advanced Search![close](https://www.queryly.com/images/whitecloseicon.png)\n\n![](//www.images-home.com/86975.gif?from=www.nzherald.co.nz)\n"

2021 \n\n![Oversubscribed SPAC sets the scene for next high-profile Australian or NZ NASDAQ listing](https://assets.cdn.thewebconsole.com/S3WEB6082/a_images/6189c5a7b2889.jpg?v=2&m=437ed49ebd470f1233d4fd32086e3f03&lqip\\(10\\))\n\nPhoto: Giorgio Trovato, via Unsplash\n\nLeading Australian investors including Uluwatu Capital, Artesian and AS1 Growth Partners have put their weight behind a new special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) aimed at fast-tracking a NASDAQ listing for a yet to be defined Australian or New Zealand tech company.\n\nCurrently known as Integral Acquisition Corporation 1 (Integral 1) and based in Australia, the company's leadership will start conversations with leading technology companies which have valuations of between $500 million and $1 billion.\n\nIntegral 1's US$115 million ($155 million) listing was several times oversubscribed with the company now trading under the symbol INTEU, led by its founder and CEO Enrique Klix, an ex-McKinsey and Citigroup executive, and chairman James Cotton, founder of CMO Compliance and Uluwatu Capital.\n\nIntegral 1’s Board of Directors is completed by Stuart Hutton, Niraj Javeri, and Lynne Thornton.\n\nUS-based firms Crescent Park Management and Carnegie Park Capital also participated in the SPAC listing with commitments for a collective US$30 million ($40 million) in the form of forward purchase agreements.\n\n\"Over the past 20 years, Australia and New Zealand have grown into hotbeds of innovation, with established tech hubs producing some of the world’s leading businesses in their field,\" says Klix, who is also an investor in the SPAC.\n\n\"We’re seeing more companies than ever coming out of our local tech ecosystem valued at over $100 million and there are no signs of this slowing.\n\n\"We believe the NASDAQ represents a more natural home for high growth tech startups looking to solve global problems, providing access to investors that understand their value as well as appropriate benchmarks and a broader community of analysts focused on technology companies.\"\n\nKlix says the Integral 1 team has superior a local knowledge, investor network and understanding of the landscape in Australia and New Zealand, making them best placed to \"enable companies with international ambitions to access the best possible opportunities for growth\".\n\nArtesian managing partner Matthew Clunies-Ross says his group has never before been so encouraged by the depth and breadth of startup talent coming out of Australia and New Zealand. \n\n\"As these businesses grow and their ambitions turn to international expansion, we must consider the best routes for our homegrown talent to reach its global potential,\" Clunies-Ross says.\n\n\"A NASDAQ listing opens up a multitude of doors for companies with global ambitions and a SPAC represents the most cost and time effective route to capitalising on these opportunities.\n\n\"We believe Enrique, James, and the team at Integral 1 are uniquely placed to uncover Australia and New Zealand’s next great success and bring it to the global stage.\"\n\nThe listing comes at a time of rapid growth for Australian and New Zealand technology companies. Venture capital investment in local companies has seen a 30 per cent compound annual growth rate over the last five years, with more than $2.5 billion invested last year alone.\n\nThe move aims to emulate success stories like Australia's Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) and New Zealand's Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB).\n\nBrisbane-based electric vehicle fast charger [**Tritium is also set to launch on the
