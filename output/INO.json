Toward this goal, we expect to have all non-device modules for our BLA completed by year end, while in parallel we continue to implement the plan to resolve the previously announced manufacturing issue with the single-use array component of the device. With this progress, we continue to target the submission of our BLA in mid-2025,\" said Dr. Jacqueline Shea, INOVIO's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our development of INO-3107 is supported by a growing body of research that collectively points to INO-3107's potential to be an important therapeutic option for all RRP patients regardless of the severity of their disease. We recently presented new immunology data highlighting the ability of INO-3107 to induce new populations of T cells that travel to the airway tissue and papilloma and correspond with clinical benefit. We've also presented our full safety and efficacy data, demonstrating that INO-3107 was shown to be well tolerated and have clinical benefit in the Phase 1/2 trial. Additionally, by the end of year, we anticipate announcing long-term clinical durability data. We continue to believe INO-3107 has the potential to become the preferred choice for the broadest number of RRP patients, healthcare providers and payors, if approved.\"\n\n**_Recent Business_**** _Highlights_**\n\n**Lead Candidate, INO-3107 – Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis**\n\nINOVIO's primary focus is driving toward the regulatory approval and commercialization of its lead product candidate, INO-3107. Recent progress includes advancing preparations for submitting the BLA, targeted for mid-2025, and announcing the following new data.\n\n_New Immunology Data_ : INOVIO presented additional immunology data demonstrating the ability of INO-3107 to induce antigen-specific T cell responses against HPV-6 and HPV-11 and drive recruitment of those T cells into airway tissues and papilloma of RRP patients, which could potentially slow or eliminate papilloma regrowth. These data were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Special Conference and at the 36th International Papillomavirus Conference. In totality, this new data showed:\n\n  * Induction of T cell responses specific to HPV-6 and HPV-11, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which were still present at week 52, indicating an establishment of memory response\n  * Expansion of clonal T cell populations in peripheral blood, including induction of new clonal T cell populations that travelled to airway or papilloma tissue\n  * Induction of inflammatory responses in papilloma and airway tissue, including:- Interferon, cytokine and chemokine signaling- Adaptive and innate immune cell infiltration, with emphasis on T cells\n  * Cytotoxic signatures of infiltrated T cells in papilloma/airway tissue, providing direct evidence of increased overall T cell infiltration compared to pre-treatment\n  * T cell infiltration in airway tissues of clinical responders were predominantly new T cell clonal populations not detectable prior to INO-3107 treatment\n  * Clinical activity not impacted by immunosuppressive papilloma microenvironment\n\n\n\n _Full Safety and Efficacy Data_ : INOVIO presented its full safety and efficacy data set for the Phase 1/2 trial in which INO-3107 was shown to be well tolerated and have clinical benefit. Of the 32 patients in the trial, 26 patients, or 81%, experienced a decrease in the number of surgical interventions in the year after treatment when compared to the year before treatment. These data were presented at both the _International Society of Vaccines Conference_ and the _Fall Voice Conference_.\n\nIn the trial, the overall clinical response (OCR) was 81%, with 26 of the 32 enrolled patients experiencing a decrease in the number of surgical interventions in the year after INO-3107 administration compared to the prior year, including 28% (9/32) that required no surgical intervention (i.e., complete response, or CR) during or after the dosing window. Further, 44% (14/32) of patients had a partial response (PR), measured by a reduction of at least 50%, but less than 100%, in the number of surgeries when compared to the prior year. The overall response rate (ORR) of patients (CR+PR) was therefore 72% (23/32). Other key data points presented include:\n\n  * INO-3107 was shown to be well tolerated and have clinical benefit- 41% (13/32) of patients reported a treatment-related Adverse Event (AE)- No treatment-related AEs greater than Grade 2 severity were reported- Most frequent treatment-related AE's reported were injection site pain (31%) and fatigue (9%)\n  * Modified Derkay-Pransky severity scores improved from baseline to the end of 52-week trial\n  * INO-3107 induced durable cellular responses and generated T cells against HPV-6 and HPV-11\n\n\n\n**Other Pipeline Updates**\n\n  * INOVIO continued to advance plans for a Phase 3 trial of **INO-3112** as a potential treatment for HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma also known as throat cancer, through ongoing conversations with regulators in the European Union. This trial is anticipated to be conducted in North America and Europe. Previously, the FDA had indicated alignment with the proposed trial design, which was developed in conjunction with a trial steering committee.\n  * INOVIO continued to advance its plans for a Phase 2 trial of **INO-4201** as a heterologous boost to the FDA licensed Ebola vaccine, Ervebo®. A meeting is scheduled with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2024 to discuss the proposed Phase 2 trial design.\n  * Patients continue to be dosed in the GBM-001 trial with **INO-5401**. Regeneron and Inovio have discussed that an appropriate next step would be a controlled Phase 2 trial.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments** : As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $84.8 million compared to $145.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $18.7 million compared to $15.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily the result of overall higher drug manufacturing costs and higher engineering professional and outside services related to device development, offset by lower employee and consultant compensation, including non-cash stock-based compensation, among other variances.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses:** G&A expenses were $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation, including non-cash employee and consultant stock-based compensation, and a decrease in legal expenses, among other variances.\n  * **Total Operating Expenses:** Total operating expenses were $27.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $35.9 million for the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $10.5 million.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $25.2 million, or $0.89 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $33.9 million, or $1.52 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Shares Outstanding:** As of September 30, 2024, INOVIO had 26.1 million common shares outstanding, 2.1 million pre-funded warrants outstanding, and 29.9 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise, vesting, and conversion, as applicable, of its outstanding pre-funded warrants, options, restricted stock units and convertible preferred stock.\n\n\n\nINOVIO's balance sheet and statement of operations are provided below. Additional information is included in INOVIO's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which can be accessed at: <http://ir.inovio.com/financials/default.aspx>.\n\n_Cash Guidance_ INOVIO estimates its cash runway to extend into the third quarter of 2025. This projection includes an operational net cash burn estimate of approximately $24 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. These cash runway projections do not include any further capital-raising activities that INOVIO may undertake. \n\n**Conference Call / Webcast Information** INOVIO's management will host a live conference call and webcast with slides at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss INOVIO's financial results and provide a general business update.

In that prior trial, patients experienced a reduction in surgeries needed to control their RRP caused by HPV-6 and HPV-11. In the recent immunology study, INO-3107 induced the expansion of both existing and new clonal T cells that travel from the blood to the papilloma and airway tissues. The new clonal T cells accounted for the majority of T cells observed in patient papilloma or airway tissue who showed either a complete or partial response to treatment with INO-3107. These new data build upon previously reported evidence that INO-3107 elicits an antigen-specific immune response targeting HPV-6 and HPV-11, to help eliminate or control RRP by reducing the need for surgery.\n\n\"These new immunology data are consistent with the clinical effect observed in our Phase 1/2 trial of elimination or reduction in the incidence of papilloma in the airway of RRP patients,\" said Dr. Matthew Morrow, INOVIO's Vice President of Translational Sciences. \"In a thorough immunological assessment, we observed that T cell infiltration in airway tissues of clinical responders was predominantly comprised of a T cell population detectable only after administration of INO-3107. This evidence supports the mechanism of action of INO-3107 and its ability to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells targeting HPV-6 and HPV-11. Furthermore, this data adds to the body of evidence indicating that DNA medicines are an effective CD8 T cell generating platform.\"\n\nBettie M. Steinberg, Interim Dean and Professor, Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine, Northwell Health, said, \"This is very encouraging data. Not only did most patients improve clinically with INO 3107 treatment, but the induction of a systemic inflammatory T-cell response and new T-cell clones that travel to the papilloma tissue to contribute to a cytotoxic response shows that it is possible to effectively address the immune dysregulation against HPV that is a hallmark of RRP.\"\n\n**_Summary of Immunology Data_** The new immunology data is to be presented at the 36th International Papillomavirus Conference (November 12-15). It builds on data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Special Conference on October 19. Collectively, these immunology data provide further support of INO-3107's ability to induce antigen-specific T cell responses against HPV-6 and HPV-11 and drive recruitment of T cells into papilloma and airway tissues of RRP patients, which could potentially slow or eliminate papilloma regrowth.\n\nINOVIO conducted a number of immunological assessments on blood samples taken throughout the trial and tissue samples taken at the beginning and end of its 52-week Phase 1/2 trial involving 32 adult RRP patients. The immunological testing showed INO-3107 produced:\n\n  * Induction of T cell responses specific for HPV-6 and HPV-11, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells still present at week 52, indicating an establishment of memory response\n  * Expansion of new clonal T cell populations in peripheral blood that travel to papilloma or airway tissues\n  * Induction of inflammatory responses in papilloma and airway tissue, including:\n  * Interferon, cytokine and chemokine signaling\n  * Adaptive and innate immune cell infiltration, with emphasis on T cells\n  * Cytotoxic signatures of infiltrated T cells in papilloma/airway tissue, and direct evidence of increased overall T cell infiltration compared to pre-treatment\n  * Clinical activity not impacted by immunosuppressive papilloma microenvironment\n\n\n\n**About RRP**\n\nRRP is a debilitating and rare disease caused primarily by HPV-6 and/or HPV-11. RRP is characterized by the development of small, wart-like growths, or papillomas, in the respiratory tract. While papillomas are generally benign, they can cause severe, life-threatening airway obstruction and respiratory complications. RRP can also significantly affect quality of life for patients by affecting the voice box, limiting the ability to speak effectively. Surgery to remove papillomas is the standard of care for RRP; however, the papillomas often grow back. INOVIO's market research to date with patients and healthcare professionals indicates that a reduction of even one surgery matters, because every surgery poses a significant risk of causing permanent damage to the vocal cords. The most widely cited U.S. epidemiology data published in 1995 estimated that there were 14,000 active cases and about 1.8 per 100,000 new cases in adults each year.\n\n**About INO-3107** INO-3107 is an investigational DNA medicine designed to elicit an antigen-specific T cell response against both HPV-6 and HPV-11 proteins. These targeted T cells are designed to seek out and kill HPV-6 and HPV-11 infected cells, with the aim of potentially preventing or slowing the growth of new papillomas. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted with INO-3107, 81.3% (26/32) of patients had a decrease in surgical interventions in the year after INO-3107 administration compared to the prior year, including 28.1% (9/32) that required no surgical intervention during or after the dosing window. Patients in the trial had a median range of 4 surgeries (2-8) in the year prior to dosing. After dosing, there was a median decrease of 3 surgical interventions (95% confidence interval -3, -2). At the outset of the trial (Day 0), patients had a clinically warranted procedure to have RRP tissue surgically removed, but any surgery performed after Day 0 during the dosing window was counted against the efficacy endpoint. Treatment with INO-3107 generated a strong immune response in the trial, inducing activated CD4 T cells and activated CD8 T cells with lytic potential. T-cell responses were also observed at Week 52, indicating a persistent cellular memory response. INO-3107 was well tolerated, with trial participants experiencing mostly low-grade (Grade 1) treatment-emergent adverse effects such as injection site pain and fatigue. Like other DNA medicines, INO-3107 has shown the ability to generate antigen-specific T cells that is not affected by anti-vector immunity impacting immunogenicity, either before administration or after the first dose unlike other T-cell generating platforms such as viral vectors. This feature of DNA medicines is anticipated to allow INO-3107 to maintain T cell response and overall efficacy, which could make it an important therapeutic option for a majority of RRP patients.\n\nThe FDA previously granted INO-3107 Orphan Drug designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation and has advised INOVIO that it can submit a biologics license application under the FDA's accelerated approval program using data from INOVIO's already completed Phase 1/2 trial. The European Commission granted INO-3107 Orphan Drug designation. In addition, INOVIO has CE-marked its CELLECTRA® delivery device in the EU, which allows INOVIO to commercialize the device in the EU and other geographies that recognize CE-marking. The United Kingdom awarded INO-3107 the Innovation Passport. This designation serves as the entry point to the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP), which aims to accelerate time to market and facilitate patient access to medicines.\n\n**About INOVIO's DNA Medicines Platform** INOVIO's DNA medicines platform has two innovative components: precisely designed DNA plasmids, delivered by INOVIO's proprietary investigational medical device, CELLECTRA®. INOVIO uses proprietary technology to design its DNA plasmids, which are small circular DNA molecules that work like software the body's cells can download to produce specific proteins to target and fight disease. INOVIO's proprietary CELLECTRA® delivery devices are designed to optimally deliver its DNA medicines to the body's cells without requiring chemical adjuvants or lipid nanoparticles and without the risk of the anti-vector response historically seen with viral vector platforms.\n\n**About INOVIO** INOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing DNA medicines to help treat and protect people from HPV-related diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. INOVIO's technology optimizes the design and delivery of innovative DNA medicines that teach the body to manufacture its own disease-fighting tools.
