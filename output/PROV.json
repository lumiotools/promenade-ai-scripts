(“Company”), NASDAQ GS: PROV, the holding company for Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (“Bank”), today announced earnings for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\n\nThe Company reported net income of $1.90 million, or $0.28 per diluted share (on 6.86 million average diluted shares outstanding), for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up eight percent from net income of $1.76 million, or $0.25 per diluted share (on 7.03 million average diluted shares outstanding), in the comparable period a year ago. The increase in earnings was due primarily to a $697,000 recovery of credit losses, in contrast to a $545,000 provision for credit losses in the comparable period a year ago, and a $148,000 increase in non-interest income, partly offset by a $667,000 increase in non-interest expenses (primarily attributable to higher salaries and employee benefits) and a $523,000 decrease in net interest income (primarily attributable to a lower net interest margin and lower interest-earning assets).\n\n“I am pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2025 operating results. Net interest income has reached an inflection point, increasing by approximately two percent from the prior sequential quarter and was largely the result of an expanding net interest margin. Credit quality improved from already strong June 30, 2024 levels, and coupled with a shorter estimated life of loans held for investment resulted in a significant recovery from the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, we almost doubled our stock repurchase activity this quarter from the prior sequential quarter,” stated Donavon P. Ternes, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Our business model performs better in a flat or upward sloping yield curve environment and we are gradually transitioning back to less restrictive operating strategies now that the Federal Open Market Committee is implementing looser monetary policy and the inverted yield curve has begun to reverse course,\" concluded Ternes.\n\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the $1.90 million net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflects a three percent decrease from $1.95 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $568,000 decrease in non-interest income (primarily due to a lower unrealized gain on other equity investments) and a $351,000 increase in non-interest expense (primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits), partly offset by a $685,000 increase in the recovery of credit losses and a $165,000 increase in net interest income (primarily due to an improvement in the net interest margin). The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation and incentive compensation. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $0.28 per share, unchanged from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nReturn on average assets was 0.61 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 0.62 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and 0.54 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Return on average stockholders’ equity for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 5.78 percent, compared to 5.96 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and 5.40 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, net interest income decreased $523,000, or six percent, to $8.62 million from $9.14 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease in net interest income was due to a lower average balance of interest-earning assets and, to a lesser extent, a lower net interest margin. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased four percent to $1.22 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.27 billion in the same quarter last year, primarily due to decreases in the average balance of loans receivable, investment securities and interest-earning deposits. The net interest margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased four basis points to 2.84 percent from 2.88 percent in the same quarter last year. The decrease in net interest margin was due to increased funding costs outpacing increased yields on interest-earning assets. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 43 basis points to 4.63 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.20 percent in the same quarter last year. In contrast, our average funding cost increased by 52 basis points to 1.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.45 percent in the same quarter last year.\n\nInterest income on loans receivable increased $847,000, or seven percent, to $13.02 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $12.18 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was due to a higher average loan yield, partly offset by a lower average loan balance. The average yield on loans receivable increased 43 basis points to 4.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.54 percent in the same quarter last year. Adjustable-rate loans of approximately $122.2 million repriced upward in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 by approximately 108 basis points from a weighted average rate of 7.40 percent to 8.48 percent. The average balance of loans receivable decreased $23.5 million, or two percent, to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.07 billion in the same quarter last year. Total loans originated for investment in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $28.9 million, up 56 percent from $18.5 million in the same quarter last year, while loan principal payments received in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $34.0 million, up 48 percent from $23.0 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nInterest income from investment securities decreased $42,000, or eight percent, to $482,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $524,000 for the same quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was attributable to a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of investment securities decreased $24.1 million, or 16 percent, to $129.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $153.7 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in the average balance was due to scheduled principal payments and prepayments of investment securities. The average yield on investment securities increased 13 basis points to 1.49 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.36 percent for the same quarter last year. The increase in the average yield was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization during the current quarter in comparison to the same quarter last year ($110,000 vs. $155,000) due to lower total principal repayments ($5.7 million vs. $6.7 million) and, to a lesser extent, the upward repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Bank received $210,000 in cash dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB’) – San Francisco stock and other equity investments, up 17 percent from $179,000 in the same quarter last year, resulting in an average yield of 8.30 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 7.53 percent in the same quarter last year. The average balance of FHLB – San Francisco and other equity investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $10.1 million, up from $9.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nInterest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was $360,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down $103,000 or 22 percent from $463,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was due to a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of the Company’s interest-earning deposits decreased $7.7 million, or 23 percent, to $26.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $34.0 million in the same quarter last year. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 5.35 percent, up three basis points from 5.32 percent in the same quarter last year. The increase in the average yield was due to a higher average interest rate on the Federal Reserve Bank’s reserve balances resulting from increases in the targeted federal funds rate during the comparable periods.\n\nInterest expense on deposits for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.82 million, an increase of $939,000 or 50 percent from $1.89 million for the same period last year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to higher rates paid on deposits, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average cost of deposits was 1.27 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up 47 basis points from 0.80 percent in the same quarter last year. The increase in the average cost of deposits was primarily attributable to an increase in higher cost time deposits, particularly brokered certificates of deposit. The average balance of deposits decreased $59.6 million, or six percent, to $880.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $940.2 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nTransaction account balances or “core deposits” decreased $14.8 million, or two percent, to $599.7 million at September 30, 2024 from $614.5 million at June 30, 2024, while time deposits decreased $9.7 million, or four percent, to $264.2 million at September 30, 2024 from $273.9 million at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, brokered certificates of deposit totaled $129.8 million with a weighted average cost of 4.95 percent (including broker fees), down $2.0 million or two percent from $131.8 million with a weighted average cost of 5.18 percent at June 30, 2024.\n\nInterest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $317,000, or 14 percent, to $2.64 million from $2.32 million for the same period last year. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was primarily the result of a higher average cost and, to a lesser extent, a higher average balance. The average cost of borrowings increased 41 basis points to 4.74 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.33 percent in the same quarter last year. The average balance of borrowings increased $8.2 million, or four percent, to $220.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $212.5 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $249.2 million of remaining borrowing capacity at the FHLB. Additionally, the Bank has an unused secured borrowing facility of approximately $211.5 million with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and an unused unsecured federal funds borrowing facility of $50.0 million with its correspondent bank. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately $510.7 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Bank continues to work with both the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to ensure that its borrowing capacity is continuously reviewed and updated in order to be accessed seamlessly should the need arise.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of $697,000 (which included a $39,000 provision for unfunded commitment reserves), in contrast to a $545,000 provision for credit losses recorded during the same period last year and a $12,000 recovery of credit losses recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (sequential quarter). The recovery of credit losses recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to a shorter estimated life of the loan portfolio resulting from higher loan prepayment estimates and the decline in the outstanding balance of loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-performing assets, comprised solely of non-accrual loans with underlying collateral located in California, decreased $490,000 or 19 percent to $2.1 million, which represented 0.17 percent of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million, which represented 0.20 percent of total assets at June 30, 2024. At both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, non-performing loans were comprised of 10 single-family loans. At both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there was no real estate owned and no loans past due by 90 days or more that were accruing interest. For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no loan charge-offs.\n\nClassified assets were $4.7 million at September 30, 2024, consisting of $634,000 of loans in the special mention category and $4.1 million of loans in the substandard category. Classified assets at June 30, 2024 were $5.8 million, consisting of $1.1 million of loans in the special mention category and $4.7 million of loans in the substandard category.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on gross loans held for investment was $6.3 million, or 0.61 percent of gross loans held for investment, at September 30, 2024, down from the $7.1 million, or 0.67 percent of gross loans held for investment, at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due primarily to a shorter estimated life and a lower balance of loans held for investment. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the allowance for credit losses is sufficient to absorb expected losses inherent in loans held for investment at September 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income increased by $148,000, or 20 percent, to $899,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $751,000 in the same period last year, due primarily to a net fair value adjustment on unsalable loans. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $568,000, or 39 percent, primarily due to a smaller unrealized gain on other equity investments.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $667,000, or 10 percent, to $7.52 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $6.86 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits, resulting from higher employee compensation, incentive compensation and retirement plan expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $351,000, or five percent as compared to $7.17 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, due primarily to higher employee compensation and incentive compensation.\n\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 79.06 percent, increasing from 69.32 percent in the same quarter last year and 72.31 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (sequential quarter). The increase in the efficiency ratio during the current quarter in comparison to the comparable quarter last year was due to higher non-interest expense and lower net interest income, partly offset by higher non-interest income.\n\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes was $789,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up nine percent from $727,000 in the same quarter last year and down two percent from $805,000 for fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (sequential quarter). The increase during the current quarter compared to the same quarter last year was due to an increase in pre-tax income. On a sequential basis, the decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to a lower net income before income taxes. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 29.3 percent as compared to 29.2 percent in the same quarter last year and 29.2 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (sequential quarter).\n\nThe Company repurchased 93,641 shares of its common stock pursuant to its current stock repurchase program at an average cost of $14.26 per share during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 95,475 shares remain available for future purchase under the Company’s current repurchase program, which expires on September 26, 2025.\n\nThe Bank currently operates 13 retail/business banking offices in Riverside County and San Bernardino County (Inland Empire).\n\nThe Company will host a conference call for institutional investors and bank analysts on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific) to discuss its financial results. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-800-715-9871 and referencing Conference ID number 3610756. An audio replay of the conference call will be available through Tuesday, November 5, 2024 by dialing 1-800-770-2030 and referencing Conference ID number 3610756.\n\nFor more financial information about the Company please visit the website at [www.myprovident.com](http://www.myprovident.com) and click on the “Investor Relations” section.\n\nSafe-Harbor Statement\n\n_This press release contains statements that the Company believes are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Business\nGeneral\nProvident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Corporation”), a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the\npurpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the “Bank”) upon the Bank’s conversion from a\nfederal mutual to a federal stock savings bank (“Conversion”). The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996. The\nCorporation is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). At June 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had consolidated total assets of $1.27 billion, total deposits of $888.3 million and stockholders’ equity of $129.9\nmillion. The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”), including the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” and the\n“Corporation” refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates\notherwise. When we refer to the “Provident” in this report, we are referring to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. When we\nrefer to the “Bank” or “Provident Savings Bank” in this report, we are referring to Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Provident.\nThe Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is\nregulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank’s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits\nby the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) – San Francisco since 1956.\nThe Bank is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland\nEmpire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, and through its\nsubsidiary, Provident Financial Corp (“PFC”). The business activities of the Bank consist of community banking, investment\nservices and trustee services for real estate transactions.\nThe Bank’s community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities\nsurrounding its full-service offices and investing those funds in the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial\nreal estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for\ninvestment. Through its subsidiary, PFC, the Bank conducts trustee services for the Bank’s real estate transactions and in the\npast has held real estate for investment. For additional information, see “Subsidiary Activities” in this Form 10-K. The\nactivities of PFC are included in the Bank's operating segment results. The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from\ninterest earned on its loan and investment portfolios, and fees generated through its community banking activities.\nOn June 22, 2006, the Bank established the Provident Savings Bank Charitable Foundation (“Foundation”) in order to further\nits commitment to the local community. The specific purpose of the Foundation is to promote and provide for the betterment\nof youth, education, housing and the arts in the Bank’s primary market areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The\nFoundation was funded with a $500,000 charitable contribution made by the Bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The\nBank contributed $40,000 to the Foundation in both fiscal 2024 and 2023.\nSubsequent Event\nOn July 25, 2024, the Corporation announced that the Provident Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per\nshare. Shareholders of Provident common stock at the close of business on August 15, 2024 were entitled to receive the cash\ndividend, payable on September 5, 2024.\n1\nTable of Contents\nMarket Area\nThe Bank is headquartered in Riverside, California and operates 12 full-service banking offices in Riverside County and one\nfull-service banking office in San Bernardino County. Management considers Riverside and Western San Bernardino counties\nto be the Bank’s primary market for deposits. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank was the largest independent community bank\nheadquartered in Riverside County and held the eighth largest deposit market share of all banks in the county, with the largest\nshare among community banks.\nThe region encompassing Riverside and San Bernardino counties, known as the “Inland Empire,” is the Bank’s main market\narea. According to the 2020 Census Bureau, these counties have the fourth and fifth largest populations in California,\nrespectively, and are part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting primarily of suburban and urban\ncommunities. The Inland Empire, with a population of approximately 4.7 million, is relatively densely populated. The U.S.\nDepartment of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unemployment rate of 5.3% in the Inland Empire in June 2024,\nslightly higher than California’s rate of 5.2% and the national rate of 4.1%. In June 2023, these rates were 4.4% in the Inland\nEmpire, 4.6% in California, and 3.6% nationwide.\nCalifornia’s home sales remained stagnant for the second consecutive month in June 2024, with a 30-year fixed mortgage rate\nabove 7% throughout most of May 2024. Closed escrow sales of existing single-family detached homes in California were at a\nseasonally adjusted annualized rate of 270,200 in June 2024, down 0.8% from the revised 272,410 homes sold in May 2024\nand 2.7% from June 2023’s revised 277,690. This sales pace has been below the 300,000 threshold for 21 consecutive months,\nwith year-to-date home sales falling behind last year’s level by 0.5% in the first half of 2024. After setting record highs in the\npast two months, the statewide median home price decreased by 0.8% from $908,040 in May 2024 to $900,720 in June 2024,\nmarking the third month in a row above the $900,000 benchmark. The June 2024 median home price was 7.5% higher than\nthe $837,850 recorded in June 2023, marking the 12th consecutive month of annual price increases, although the smallest\nsince January 2024. The continued rise in million-dollar home sales in California contributed to median price growth, with the\nmillion-dollar-and-higher market segment increasing by 2.0% year-over-year in June 2024, while the sub-$500,000 segment\ndeclined by 21.0%. Homes priced above $1 million now account for 36.3% of all sales, the largest share in at least five years.\n(Source data from California Association of Realtors – July 17, 2024 News Release).\nThe Inland Empire, also known as the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical Area, is a large, two-county\narea where about 30% of the labor force commutes, with nearly 400,000 people traveling daily from the Inland Empire to\ncoastal areas. Over the past 20 years, the region has undergone significant changes, particularly in the health care and\ntransportation and warehousing sectors, which have seen substantial employment growth. Typically, the Inland Empire's\nunemployment rate is higher than those of California and the U.S. except during specific recessions like the dot-com and\nCOVID-19 periods. The region performed better during the recovery from the 2020 recession, with the latest unemployment\nrate published by the Employment Development Department (EDD) for December 2023 at 5.1%. The change in\nunemployment rate from February 2020 to December 2023 was 0.2% for the U.S., 0.5% for California, and 1.2% for the\nInland Empire, indicating a higher increase in the Inland Empire, which is less desirable. Conversely, the employment growth\nrate over the same period was 1.8% for the U.S., -1.2% for California, and 2.8% for the Inland Empire. In 2023, the Inland\nEmpire was a top performer in job creation compared to other California regions, with a 1.9% increase. The Inland Empire\nalso led the state in business creation during the recovery from the 2020 recession, with a significant acceleration starting in\nthe second quarter of 2022 and reaching near-national levels by the second quarter of 2023. (Source data from the Lowe\nInstitute of Political Economy - The State of the Region the Inland Empire 2024 – March 2024).\nCompetition\nThe Bank faces significant competition in its market area in originating real estate loans and attracting deposits. The\npopulation growth in the Inland Empire has attracted numerous financial institutions to the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s\nprimary competitors are large national and regional commercial banks as well as other community-oriented banks and savings\ninstitutions. The Bank also faces competition from credit unions and a large number of mortgage companies that operate\nwithin its market area, as well as unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities operating locally and elsewhere. Many of\nthese institutions are significantly larger than the Bank and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than the\nBank. This competition may limit the Bank’s growth and profitability in the future.\n2\nTable of Contents\nReportable Segments\nManagement monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and services the Bank offers, but\noperations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan\nwhich is developed each year.

The lending activity of the Bank is comprised of the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial real\nestate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for\ninvestment. Additional lending activities have historically included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-\nrate first trust deed mortgages. The Bank’s net loans held for investment were $1.05 billion at June 30, 2024, representing\n83% of consolidated total assets. This compares to $1.08 billion, or 81% of consolidated total assets, at June 30, 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024, the maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to any one borrower and the borrower’s related\nentities under applicable regulations was $20.1 million, or 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. At June 30,\n2024, the Bank had no loans or group of loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. The\nBank’s five largest lending relationships at June 30, 2024 consisted of: four multi-family loans totaling $5.0 million to one\ngroup of borrowers; eight single-family loans totaling $4.4 million to one group of borrowers; three multi-family loans\ntotaling $4.1 million to one group of borrowers; one multi-family loan totaling $4.1 million to one group of borrowers; and\none multi-family loan totaling $4.0 million to one group of borrowers. The real estate collateral for these loans are primarily\nlocated in Southern and Northern California. At June 30, 2024, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their\nrepayment terms.\n3\nTable of Contents\nLoans Held For Investment Analysis.

The average life of loans is\ngenerally substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses generally\ngive the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the\nreal property that secures the loan. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current market\ninterest rates are substantially higher than the interest rates on existing loans held for investment and, conversely, decrease\nwhen the interest rates on existing loans held for investment are substantially higher than current market interest rates, as\nborrowers are generally less inclined to refinance their loans when market rates increase and more inclined to refinance their\nloans when market rates decrease.\nThe table below describes the geographic dispersion of real estate secured loans held for investment (gross) at June 30, 2024\nand 2023, as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nAs of June 30, 2024:\nInland Southern Other Other\nEmpire(1) California(2) California States Total\nLoan\nCategory Balance % Balance % Balance % Balance % Balance %\nSingle-family $ 146,003 28 % $ 175,127 34 % $ 196,707 38 % $ 254 — % $ 518,091 100 %\nMulti-family 56,693 13 % 256,692 58 % 131,797 29 % — — % 445,182 100 %\nCommercial\nreal estate 13,583 16 % 44,574 54 % 25,192 30 % — — % 83,349 100 %\nConstruction 228 8 % 1,480 55 % 984 37 % — — % 2,692 100 %\nOther — — % 95 100 % — — % — — % 95 100 %\nTotal $ 216,507 21 % $ 477,968 45 % $ 354,680 34 % $ 254 — % $ 1,049,409 100 %\n(1) Comprised of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n(2) Other than the Inland Empire.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2023:\nInland Southern Other Other\nEmpire(1) California(2) California States Total\nLoan\nCategory Balance % Balance % Balance % Balance % Balance %\nSingle-family $ 149,569 29 % $ 174,421 34 % $ 194,570 37 % $ 261 — % $ 518,821 100 %\nMulti-family 61,672 13 % 272,178 59 % 127,263 28 % — — % 461,113 100 %\nCommercial\nreal estate 16,586 18 % 49,183 54 % 24,789 28 % — — % 90,558 100 %\nConstruction 590 30 % 1,116 58 % 230 12 % — — % 1,936 100 %\nOther — — % 106 100 % — — % — — % 106 100 %\nTotal $ 228,417 21 % $ 497,004 47 % $ 346,852 32 % $ 261 — % $ 1,072,534 100 %\n(1) Comprised of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n(2) Other than the Inland Empire.\nSingle-Family Mortgage Loans. One of the Bank’s primary lending activities is the origination and purchase of adjustable\nand fixed rate mortgage loans to be held for investment, secured by first trust deed mortgages on owner-occupied, single-\nfamily (one to four units) residences in the communities where the Bank’s branches are located and surrounding areas in\nSouthern and Northern California. During fiscal 2024, the Bank originated $40.9 million of single-family loans to be held for\ninvestment, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s origination guidelines, and did not purchase any\nsingle-family loans. This compares to single-family loan originations of $165.9 million and no loan purchases during fiscal\n2023. At June 30, 2024, total single-family loans held for investment decreased slightly to $518.1 million, or 49% of the total\nloans held for investment, from $518.8 million, or 48% of the total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2023. The decrease\nin the single-family loans in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to loan principal payments that exceeded new loans\noriginated for investment. During fiscal 2024, the Bank did not have any recovery from non-performing single-family loans,\nas compared to net recoveries of $8,000 during fiscal 2023. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, total non-performing single-family\nloans were $2.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, net of allowances and charge-offs, and there were no loans past due 30\nto 89 days at both dates.\nThe Bank has underwriting standards that generally conform with the standards of the government sponsored entities (“GSE”)\nwhich include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage insurance is usually required for all loans exceeding 80% loan-to-\nvalue (“LTV”) based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination. The Bank is not\ncurrently offering loans with LTV ratios greater than 90%. The ratio is derived by dividing the original loan balance by the\nlower of the original appraised value or purchase price of the real estate collateral. Currently, the maximum LTV ratio is 90%\nfor new purchases and limited cash-out refinances and 75% for cash-out refinances. The maximum loan amount offered on\nsingle-family homes is $1.5 million. A limited cash-out refinance transaction limits cash back to the borrower to the lesser of\n2% of the new loan amount or $2,000. The lowest FICO score currently offered for a purchase or no cash-out refinance\ntransaction is 700, while the lowest FICO score for a cash-out refinance transaction is 720. The FICO score represents the\ncreditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrower’s credit history, as reported by an independent third party. A higher\nFICO score indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness. Bank regulators have issued guidance stating that a FICO score of\n660 and below is indicative of a “subprime” borrower.\nThe Bank currently lends on residential properties classified as single-family units, planned unit developments and\ncondominiums. Underwriting standards and guidelines may change at any time, based on shifts in real estate market\nconditions or changes to GSE policies and guidelines. To enhance protection, the Bank purchases lender-paid mortgage\ninsurance for certain single-family mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2024, a total of approximately $141.8 million of single-\nfamily mortgage loans, with a 79% weighted average LTV at the time of origination have lender-paid mortgage insurance.\nThis insurance provides a weighted average coverage ratio of approximately 11% of the original loan amount.\nPrior to fiscal 2009, many of the loans we originated for investment consisted of non-traditional single-family residential loans\nthat do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines as a result of the characteristics of the borrower or\nproperty, the loan terms, loan size or exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines. In exchange for the additional risk to us\nassociated with these loans, these borrowers generally are required to pay a higher interest rate, and\n6\nTable of Contents\ndepending on the credit history, a lower loan-to-value ratio was generally required than for a conforming loan. Our non-\ntraditional single-family residential loans include loans to borrowers who provided limited or no documentation of their\nincome or stated income loans, negative amortization loans (a loan in which accrued interest exceeding the required monthly\nloan payment is added to loan principal up to 115% of the original loan amount), more than 30-year amortization loans, and\nloans to borrowers with a FICO score below 660 (these loans are considered subprime by the OCC).\nAs of June 30, 2024, these non-traditional loans totaled $17.7 million, comprising 3% of total single-family residential loans\nheld for investment and 2% of total loans held for investment, with a weighted average seasoning of 16.1 years. At that date,\nstated income loans totaled $13.0 million, more than 30-year amortization loans totaled $6.0 million, low FICO score loans\ntotaled $1.7 million, and negative amortization loans totaled $402,000 (the outstanding balances described may overlap more\nthan one category).\nThe Bank currently offers fixed-rate loans in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, along with adjustable-rate mortgage\n(“ARM”) loans throughout California. Substantially all the loans originated by the Bank comply with GSE underwriting\nstandards concerning credit and collateral. The Bank's ARM products offer various options, with interest rates adjusting every\nsix months after an initial fixed period of five to ten years. These adjustments are limited by caps on semi-annual and lifetime\nrate changes.\nCurrently, the ARM programs have a rate consisting of an Index tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus\na margin. The programs are limited to a maximum semi-annual increase or decrease of one percentage point with a maximum\nlifetime increase of five percentage points and the rate may not fall below the margin. The portfolio currently consists of the\nfollowing indices, plus a margin of between 2.00% and 3.25%, which are used to calculate the periodic interest rate changes:\nSOFR, the 12-month average U.S. Treasury (“12 MAT”) or the weekly average yield on one-year U.S. Treasury securities\nadjusted to a constant maturity of one year (“CMT”). Loans based on the SOFR index constitute a majority of the Bank’s\nloans held for investment. The majority of the ARM loans held for investment have five, seven, or 10-year fixed periods prior\nto the first adjustment and provide for fully amortizing loan payments throughout the term of the loan. Loans of this type have\nembedded interest rate risk if interest rates should rise during the initial fixed rate period or if rates should rise beyond the\nperiodic or lifetime caps.\nBorrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations\nof changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of\nloan. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined\nby the demand for each product in a given interest rate and competitive environment.\nThe retention of ARM loans, rather than fixed-rate loans, helps to reduce the Bank’s exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThere is, however, unquantifiable credit risk resulting from the potential of increased interest charges to be paid by the\nborrower as a result of increases in interest rates. It is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on\nARM loans may increase as a result of the increase in the required payment from the borrower. Further, the risk of default may\nincrease because ARM loans originated by the Bank occasionally provide, as a marketing incentive, for initial rates of interest\nbelow those rates that would apply if the adjustment index plus the applicable margin were initially used for pricing. Because\nof these characteristics, ARM loans are subject to increased risks of default or delinquency. Additionally, while ARM loans\nallow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its assets as a result of changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate\nsensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not\nrespond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in\nthe Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Conversely,\ndownward adjustments on the Bank’s cost of funds typically lag adjustments on ARM loans which may occur more rapidly\nduring periods of declining interest rates. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates on our loan\nportfolio, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Form 10-K.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requires lenders to make a\nreasonable, good faith determination of a borrower’s ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a\ndwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory\nenforcement actions result from these rules. The Bank may originate loans that do not meet the definition of a “qualified\nmortgage” (“QM”). To mitigate the risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes,\n7\nTable of Contents\nprocedural and product changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the “ability-to-repay” requirements\nare adequately addressed.\nA decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of real estate secured loans could result in higher loan\ndelinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real estate markets are\nbeyond the Bank’s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other\nfactors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, housing supply\nand demand, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as\nearthquakes, fires, droughts and other natural disasters particular to California where substantially all of our real estate\ncollateral is located. If real estate values decline from the levels at the time of loan origination, the value of our real estate\ncollateral securing the loans could be significantly reduced. The Bank’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing\nand selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely that the Bank could suffer losses on\ndefaulted loans.\nMulti-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2024, multi-family loans were $445.2 million and\ncommercial real estate loans were $83.3 million, or 42% and 8%, respectively, of loans held for investment. This compares to\nmulti-family loans of $461.1 million and commercial real estate loans of $90.6 million, or 43% and 8%, respectively, of loans\nheld for investment at June 30, 2023. Consistent with its strategy to diversify the composition of loans held for investment, the\nBank has emphasized the origination and purchase of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. During fiscal 2024, the\nBank originated $31.9 million in multi-family and commercial real estate loans but did not purchase any. This is a decrease\nfrom fiscal 2023, when $69.3 million of such loans were originated and none were purchased. As of June 30, 2024, the\naverage outstanding loan balance was approximately $724,000 for multi-family loans and approximately $731,000 for\ncommercial real estate loans.\nThe multi-family loans originated by the Bank are predominately adjustable-rate loans, including hybrid ARM loans, with\nterms ranging from 10 to 30 years and amortization schedules of 25 to 30 years. Similarly, the Bank’s commercial real estate\nloans are mainly adjustable-rate loans, also including hybrid ARM loans, with the same maturity terms and amortization\nschedules. The interest rates on multi-family and commercial real estate ARM loans generally adjust monthly, quarterly, semi-\nannually, or annually, based on a specific margin over the relevant interest rate index and are subject to periodic and lifetime\ninterest rate caps. At June 30, 2024, $428.4 million, or 96%, of the Bank’s multi-family loans were secured by projects with\nfive to 36 units. The Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of loans secured by small office buildings,\nlight industrial buildings, warehouses, and small retail centers. The properties securing these loans are mainly located in the\ncounties of Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, and Santa Clara. The Bank\ntypically originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans in amounts ranging from $350,000 to $6.0 million. At June\n30, 2024, the Bank had 57 commercial real estate and multi-family loans with principal balances greater than $1.5 million,\ntotaling $125.7 million. Appraisals are obtained for all properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The\nunderwriting process for these loans includes a thorough analysis of the property's cash flows to ensure adequate debt service\ncoverage, as well as an evaluation of the financial resources, experience, and income levels of the borrowers and guarantors.\nMulti-family and commercial real estate loans afford the Bank an opportunity to price the loans with higher interest rates than\nthose generally available from single-family mortgage loans. However, loans secured by such properties are generally greater\nin amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and are more susceptible to default as a result of general economic\nconditions and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on\nloans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and\nmanagement of the properties, repayment of such loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the\neconomy. During both fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on multi-family and commercial real\nestate loans. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no non-performing or 30 to 89 days delinquent multi-family and\ncommercial real estate loans. Non-performing loans and/or delinquent loans may increase if there is a general decline in\nCalifornia real estate markets and in the event poor general economic conditions prevail.\nConstruction Loans. The Bank originates from time to time two types of construction loans: short-term construction loans\nand construction/permanent loans. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank originated a total of $1.5 million and $1.6 million of\nconstruction loans (including undisbursed loan funds), respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had construction\nloans totaling $2.7 million and $1.9 million, net of undisbursed loan funds of $435,000 and $1.9 million,\n8\nTable of Contents\nrespectively. On these dates, the loans consisted of bridge loans totaling $1.5 million and $0, short-term construction loans\ntotaling $228,000 and $1.7 million, and construction/permanent loans totaling $984,000 and $230,000 respectively.\nShort-term construction loans include three types of loans: custom construction, tract construction, and speculative\nconstruction. The Bank provides construction financing for single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate properties.\nCustom construction loans are made to individuals who, at the time of application, have a contract executed with a builder to\nconstruct their residence. Custom construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 to 18 months, with adjustable or\nfixed interest rates at the prime lending rate plus a margin and with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% of the appraised value of\nthe completed property. The owner secures long-term permanent financing at the completion of construction. At June 30,\n2024, there were no custom short-term single-family construction loans. This compares to June 30, 2023 when the Bank had\none custom short-term single-family construction loan totaling $496,000, net of undisbursed loan funds of $49,000.\nFrom time to time the Bank makes lot loans to individuals to finance land acquisition prior to the start of construction or tract\nconstruction loans to subdivision builders. These subdivisions are usually financed and built in phases. A thorough analysis of\nmarket trends and demand within the area are reviewed for feasibility. Tract construction may include the building and\nfinancing of model homes under a separate loan. At June 30, 2024, there was one land loan of $95,000 (reported as other\nmortgage loans) and no tract construction loans; as compared to one land loan for $106,000 (reported as other mortgage loans)\nand one tract construction loan for $1.1 million, net of undisbursed loan funds of $567,000 at June 30, 2023.\nSpeculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed “speculative” because the home builder does not\nhave, at the time of loan origination, a signed sale contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing\nwith either the Bank or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified during or after the\nconstruction period. The builder may be required to debt service the speculative construction loan for a significant period of\ntime after the completion of construction until the homebuyer is identified. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had one speculative\nconstruction loan of $228,000, net of undisbursed loan funds of $32,000, as compared to one construction loan of $94,000, net\nof undisbursed loan funds of $166,000 at June 30, 2023.\nConstruction/permanent loans automatically roll from the construction to the permanent phase. The construction phase\ngenerally lasts 12 to 18 months and the interest rate charged is generally fixed at a margin above prime rate and with a loan-to-\nvalue ratio of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. At June 30, 2024, there were $984,000 of custom\nconstruction/permanent loans, net of undisbursed loan funds of $403,000 as compared to $230,000 of custom\nconstruction/permanent loans, net of undisbursed loan funds of $1.2 million at June 30, 2023.\nConstruction loans under $1.0 million are approved by Bank personnel specifically designated to approve construction loans.\nThe Bank’s Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Senior Vice President –\nSingle-Family Division and Vice President - Loan Administration, approves all construction loans over $1.0 million. Prior to\napproval of any construction loan, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and the Bank reviews the existing or\nproposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project, and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on\nthe project. In the case of a tract or speculative construction loan, the Bank also reviews the experience and expertise of the\nbuilder. The Bank obtains credit reports, financial statements and tax returns on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent\nappraisal of the project, and any other expert report necessary to evaluate the proposed project. In the event of cost overruns,\nthe Bank requires the borrower to deposit their own funds into a loan-in-process account, which the Bank disburses consistent\nwith the completion of the subject property pursuant to a revised disbursement schedule.\nThe construction loan documents require that construction loan proceeds be disbursed in increments as construction\nprogresses. Disbursements are based on periodic on-site inspections by independent inspectors and/or Bank personnel. At\ninception, the Bank also requires borrowers to deposit funds into a loan-in-process account covering the difference between\nthe actual cost of construction and the loan amount. The Bank regularly monitors the construction loan portfolio, economic\nconditions and housing inventory. The Bank’s property inspectors perform periodic inspections. The Bank believes that the\ninternal monitoring system helps reduce many of the risks inherent in its construction loans.\n9\nTable of Contents\nConstruction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than\nits single-family mortgage loans. Construction loans, however, are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than\nsingle-family mortgage loans because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property’s value at completion of the\nproject and the cost of the project. The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and\nmonitor. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the\namount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be\ninaccurate, the Bank may be confronted with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. Projects may also\nbe jeopardized by disagreements between borrowers and builders and by the failure of builders to pay subcontractors. Loans to\nbuilders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan\ndepends on the builder’s ability to sell the property prior to the time that the construction loan matures. The Bank has sought\nto address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. In\naddition, because the Bank’s construction lending is in its primary market area, changes in the local or regional economy and\nreal estate market could adversely affect the Bank’s construction loans held for investment. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the\nBank had no charge-offs or recoveries on construction loans, and no construction loans were non-performing or 30-89 days\ndelinquent at both June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nParticipation Loan Purchases and Sales. To expand production and diversify risk, the Bank purchases loans and loan\nparticipations, primarily with collateral located in California, which allows for greater geographic distribution outside of the\nBank’s primary lending areas. The Bank typically purchases between 50% and 100% of the total loan amount. When\npurchasing a participation loan, the lead lender usually retains a servicing fee, which reduces the loan yield to approximately\nthe cost the Bank would incur if it serviced the loan itself. All properties serving as collateral for these loan participations are\ninspected by either a Bank employee or a third-party inspection service before being approved by the Loan Committee. The\nBank uses the same underwriting criteria for these purchases as it does for loans it originates. The Bank did not purchase any\nloans to be held for investment in fiscal 2024 and 2023, due primarily to concerns over asset quality in light of the current\neconomic climate and fewer loans available for purchase. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were $1.8 million and $10.6\nmillion of loans serviced by other financial institutions, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, all loans serviced by\nothers were performing according to their original contractual payment terms, except for one loan totaling $362,000 that was\nclassified as non-performing as of June 30, 2024.\nThe Bank also sells participating interests in loans when it has been determined that it is beneficial to diversify the Bank’s\nrisk. Participation sales enable the Bank to maintain acceptable loan concentrations and comply with the Bank’s loans to one\nborrower policy. Generally, selling a participating interest in a loan increases the yield to the Bank on the portion of the loan\nthat is retained. The Bank did not sell any participation loans in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\nCommercial Business Loans. The Bank has a Business Banking Department that primarily serves businesses located within\nthe Inland Empire. Commercial business loans allow the Bank to diversify its lending and increase the average loan yield. As\nof June 30, 2024, commercial business loans were $1.4 million, down from $1.6 million at June 30, 2023. These loans\nrepresent secured and unsecured lines of credit and term loans secured by business assets.\nCommercial business loans are generally made to customers who are well known to the Bank and are generally secured by\naccounts receivable, inventory, business equipment and/or other assets. The Bank’s commercial business loans may be\nstructured as term loans or as lines of credit. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin\nabove the prime rate and term loans are at a fixed or variable rate. The Bank may also require personal guarantees from\nfinancially capable parties associated with the business based on a review of personal financial statements. Commercial\nbusiness term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less. Commercial\nlines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are typically approved with a term of one\nyear or less.\nCommercial business loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans and involve risks that are different from those\nassociated with residential and commercial real estate loans. Real estate loans are generally considered to be collateral based\nlending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral value and liquidation of the underlying real estate\ncollateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans\nare often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets including real estate, the\nliquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts\nreceivable may not be collectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited\n10\nTable of Contents\nuse. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower\n(and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is secondary and oftentimes an insufficient source of repayment. At June\n30, 2024 and 2023, there were no non-performing commercial business loans. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank had no\ncharge-offs or recoveries on commercial business loans.\nConsumer Loans. At June 30, 2024, the Bank’s consumer loans were $65,000, unchanged from June 30, 2023. The Bank\noffers open-ended lines of credit on an unsecured basis, primarily deposit overdraft lines of credit.\nConsumer loans potentially have a greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are\nunsecured. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s ongoing financial stability, and thus are more likely to\nbe adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state\nlaws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.\nThe Bank had no non-performing consumer loans at both June 30, 2024 and 2023. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank had\nno charge-offs or recoveries on consumer loans.\nLoans Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments\nMortgage loans are primarily originated for investment. Prior to scaling back originations of saleable single-family fixed-rate\nmortgage loans during fiscal 2019, a large amount of single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans were originated for sale to\ninstitutional investors. Mortgage loans sold to investors generally were sold without recourse other than standard\nrepresentations and warranties. Generally, mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were sold on a non-recourse\nbasis and foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the purchaser and not the Bank, except in the case of Federal\nHousing Administration (“FHA”) and Veterans’ Administration (“VA”) loans used to form Government National Mortgage\nAssociation pools, which are subject to limitations on the FHA’s and VA’s loan guarantees.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the Bank’s loan originations, purchases, sales and principal repayments during the periods\nindicated. No loans were purchased during the periods indicated:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nLoans originated for sale:\nWholesale originations $ 5,605 $ 512\nTotal loans originated for sale 5,605 512\nLoans sold:\nServicing retained (5,605) (512)\nTotal loans sold (5,605) (512)\nLoans originated for investment:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family 40,920 165,942\nMulti-family 22,112 50,323\nCommercial real estate 9,757 18,979\nConstruction 1,480 1,648\nCommercial business loans 1,250 190\nTotal loans originated for investment 75,519 237,082\nLoan principal repayments (99,915) (102,288)\n(Decrease) increase in other items, net (1) (254) 2,843\nNet (decrease) increase in loans held for investment $ (24,650) $ 137,637\n(1) Includes net changes in undisbursed loan funds, deferred loan fees or costs, ACL, fair value of loans held for investment\nand advance payments of escrows.\nLoan Servicing\nThe Bank receives fees from a variety of investors in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual\nloan payments on loans sold by the Bank to such investors. At June 30, 2024, the Bank was servicing $34.6 million of loans\nfor others, a 6% increase from $32.6 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to new loans sold with\nservicing retained, partly offset by scheduled principal payments and prepayments. Loan servicing includes processing\npayments, accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes, hazard insurance and other loan-related items\nsuch as private mortgage insurance. After the Bank receives the gross mortgage payment from individual borrowers, it remits\nto the investor a predetermined net amount based on the loan sale agreement for that mortgage.\nServicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income and are carried at the\nlower of cost or fair value. The fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated net\nfuture cash flows consistent with contractually specified servicing fees. The Bank periodically evaluates servicing assets for\nimpairment, which is measured as the excess of cost over fair value. This review is performed on a disaggregated basis, based\non loan type and interest rate. Generally, loan servicing becomes more valuable when interest rates rise (as prepayments\ntypically decrease) and less valuable when interest rates decline (as prepayments typically increase). In estimating fair values\nat June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank used a weighted average Constant Prepayment Rate (“CPR”) of 9.59% and 7.44%, and a\nweighted average discount rate of 9.06% and 9.05%, respectively. The required impairment reserve against servicing assets at\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 was $170,000 and $165,000, respectively. In aggregate, servicing assets had a carrying value of\n$272,000 and a fair value of $102,000 at June 30, 2024, compared to a carrying value of $256,000 and a fair value of $91,000\nat June 30, 2023.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAsset Quality\nDelinquent Loans. When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank initiates collection\nprocedures. In most cases, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if the loan remains delinquent on the 120th day for\nsingle-family loans or the 90th day for other loans, or sooner if the borrower is chronically delinquent, and after all reasonable\nmeans of obtaining the payment have been exhausted, foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the security\ninstrument and applicable law, are initiated. Interest income is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest\non such loans.\nAs of June 30, 2024, total non-performing assets, net of the ACL and fair value adjustments, were $2.6 million, or 0.20% of\ntotal assets, which was comprised of 10 single-family loans. As of June 30, 2024, $1.1 million or 43% of the total non-\nperforming loans had a current payment status. In comparison, as of June 30, 2023, total non-performing assets, net of the\nACL and fair value adjustments, were $1.3 million, or 0.10% of total assets, consisting of six single-family loans, with\n$175,000 or 13% having a current payment status. The Bank had no real estate owned (“REO”) both at June 30, 2024 and\n2023.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s non-performing assets, net of the ACL and fair value\nadjustments, at the dates indicated:\nAt June 30,\n(Dollars In Thousands) 2024 2023\nLoans on non-performing status:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 2,596 $ 1,300\nTotal 2,596 1,300\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more — —\nTotal non-performing loans 2,596 1,300\nReal estate owned, net — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 2,596 $ 1,300\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of loans held for investment, net 0.25 % 0.12 %\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of total assets 0.20 % 0.10 %\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.20 % 0.10 %\nThe Bank assesses loans individually and classifies the loans as non-performing and substandard in accordance with\nregulatory requirements when the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans have been modified or management has\nserious doubts about the future collectability of principal and interest, even though the loans may be currently performing.\nFactors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, collateral value,\nthe financial condition of the borrower and/or guarantor and current economic conditions. The Bank measures each non-\nperforming loan based on Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,”\nestablishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance, and charges off those loans or portions of loans\ndeemed uncollectible.\nModified Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. We occasionally modify loans to alleviate temporary\ndifficulties in the borrower’s financial condition and/or constraints on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and to minimize\nour potential losses. We refer to these modifications as modified loans to troubled borrowers. Modifications may include\nchanges in the amortization terms of the loan, reductions in interest rates, acceptance of interest only payments, and, in very\nlimited cases, reductions to the outstanding loan balance. Such loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status\n13\nTable of Contents\nwhen there is doubt concerning the full repayment of principal and interest or the loan has been past due for a period of 120th\nday for single-family loans or the 90th day for other loans or sooner if other activities have taken place such as a notice of\ndefault has been issued, or if the borrower is chronically delinquent. Such loans may be returned to accrual status when all\ncontractual amounts past due have been brought current, and the borrower’s performance under the modified terms of the loan\nagreement and the ultimate collectability of all contractual amounts due under the modified terms is no longer in doubt.\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02,\n“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” This ASU provides\nnew guidance on the treatment of troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) in relation to the adoption of the current expected\ncredit loss methodology, or CECL model, for the accounting for credit losses (discussed below). Previous accounting guidance\nrelated to TDRs is eliminated and new disclosure requirements are adopted in regards to loan modifications made to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulties under the assumption that the CECL model will capture credit losses related to TDRs. The\nrequired disclosures regarding gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination and loan modifications are\npresented under Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326, the Bank\nno longer reports TDRs or classifies loans as TDRs given those loans previously recognized as TDRs have been incorporated\ninto the CECL methodology in regard to credit loss reserves as of July 1, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, there were no loan\nmodifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nForeclosed Real Estate. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is\nclassified as REO until it is sold. When a property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less the estimated cost of\nsale. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. As of both June 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no REO\nproperty. In managing the real estate owned properties for quick disposition, the Bank completes the necessary repairs and\nmaintenance to the individual properties before listing for sale, obtains new appraisals and broker price opinions (“BPO”) to\ndetermine current market listing prices, and engages local realtors who are most familiar with real estate sub-markets, among\nother techniques, which generally results in the quick disposition of real estate owned.\nAsset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding the problem assets of savings institutions. The\nregulations require that each institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with\nexaminations of institutions, OCC examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to\nbe classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or\nmore defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the\ndeficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that\nthe weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values\nquestionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little\nvalue that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the\ninstitution establishes an individually evaluated allowance and may subsequently charge-off the amount of the asset classified\nas loss. A portion of the ACL established to cover probable losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be\nincluded in determining an institution’s regulatory capital. Assets that do not currently expose the institution to sufficient risk\nto warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and\nare closely monitored by the Bank.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes classified assets, which is comprised of classified loans located in California, including loans\nclassified by the Bank as special mention, net of the ACL, and REO at the dates indicated:\nAt June 30, 2024 At June 30, 2023\n(Dollars In Thousands) Balance Count Balance Count\nSpecial mention loans:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 1,099 1 $ — —\nMulti-family — — 510 1\nTotal special mention loans 1,099 1 510 1\nSubstandard loans:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family 2,596 10 1,300 6\nMulti-family 2,066 3 — —\nCommercial real estate — — 547 1\nTotal substandard loans 4,662 13 1,847 7\nTotal classified loans 5,761 14 2,357 8\nReal estate owned:\nSingle-family — — — —\nTotal real estate owned — — — —\nTotal classified assets $ 5,761 14 $ 2,357 8\nTotal classified assets as a percentage of total assets 0.45 % 0.18 %\nNot all of the Bank’s classified assets are delinquent or non-performing. In determining whether the Bank’s assets expose the\nBank to sufficient risk to warrant classification, the Bank may consider various factors, including the payment history of the\nborrower, the loan-to-value ratio, the reserves of the borrower and guarantors, and the debt coverage ratio of the property\nsecuring the loan, among other factors. After consideration of these and other factors, the Bank may determine that the asset in\nquestion, though not currently delinquent, presents a risk of loss that requires it to be classified or designated as special\nmention. In addition, the Bank’s loans held for investment may include single-family, commercial and multi-family real estate\nloans with a balance exceeding the current market value of the collateral which are not classified because they are performing\nand have borrowers and/or guarantor who have sufficient resources to support the repayment of the loan.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. On July 1, 2023, the Corporation adopted ASC 326 that replaced the incurred loss\nmethodology with the current expected credit loss or CECL methodology. CECL requires an estimate of expected credit losses\nfor the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts and applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans held for investment, held-to-\nmaturity investment securities and some off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments to extend\ncredit. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an ACL.\nThe responsibility for the review of the Bank’s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the ACL lies with the Internal\nAsset Review Committee (“IAR Committee”). The Bank adjusts its ACL by charging (crediting) its provision for (recovery\nof) credit losses against the Bank’s operations.\nThe Bank has established a methodology for the determination of the provision for credit losses. The methodology is set forth\nin a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for a collectively evaluated allowance for groups of homogeneous\nloans and an individually evaluated allowance that is tied to individual problem loans. The Bank’s methodology for assessing\nthe appropriateness of the ACL consists of several key elements.\n15\nTable of Contents\nUnder ASC 326, the ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loan’s amortized cost basis to present the net\namount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information\nabout past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the\ncollectability of the reported amount. The Bank’s ACL is calculated quarterly, with any difference in the calculated ACL and\nthe recorded ACL trued-up through an entry to the provision for credit losses. Management calculates the quantitative portion\nof the collectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an average charge-off or loss rate methodology and\ngenerally evaluates collectively evaluated loans by Call Report code in order to group and determine portfolio loan segments\nwith similar risk characteristics. The Bank primarily utilizes historical loss rates for the CECL calculation based on its own\nspecific historical losses and/or with peer loss history where applicable.\nThe expected loss rates are applied to expected monthly loan balances estimated through the consideration of contractual\nrepayment terms and expected prepayments. The prepayment assumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual\nlife of the loans are estimated based on historical and bank-specific experience and the consideration of current and expected\nconditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptions may be updated by\nmanagement in the event that changing conditions impact management’s estimate or additional historical data gathered has\nresulted in the need for a reevaluation.\nFor its reasonable and supportable forecasting of current expected credit losses, the Bank utilizes a regression model using\nforecasted economic metrics and historical loss data. The regression model utilized upon implementation of CECL on July 1,\n2023, and as of June 30, 2024, relied upon reasonable and supportable 12-month forecasts of the National Unemployment\nRate and change in the Real Gross Domestic Product, after which it reverts to a historical loss rate. Management selected the\nNational Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic Product as the drivers of the forward look component of the\ncollectively evaluated allowance, primarily as a result of high correlation coefficients identified in regression modeling, the\navailability of forecasts, including the quarterly Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) forecast, and the widespread\nfamiliarity of these economic metrics.\nManagement recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in\nthe quantitative portion of allowance on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditions may vary compared\nwith conditions over the historical lookback period, which is utilized in the calculation of the quantitative allowance,\nmanagement considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loans may be warranted,\ngiven the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. The following qualitative factors (“Q-factors”) considered by\nmanagement reflect the regulatory guidance on the Q-factors:\n● Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.\n● Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.\n● The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n● Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that\naffect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.\n● The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of\nestimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio.\n● Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-performing loans, and the volume and\nseverity of adversely classified or graded loans.\n● Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system.\n● Changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans in the portfolio.\n● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off,\nand recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.\nThe qualitative portion of the Bank’s allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using management judgment, to\ndetermine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative allowance is also\ncontingent upon the relative weighting of the Q-factors according to management’s judgment.\nLoans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that\nforeclosure is probable and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair\nvalue of collateral at the reporting date, less selling costs.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAccrued interest receivable for loans is included in the accrued interest receivable line item on the Corporation’s Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition. The Bank elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead\nelected to reverse accrued interest income on loans that are placed on non-performing status. A loan is deemed non-performing\nwhen the Bank has stopped accruing interest income, or it is 90 days or more delinquent. Any outstanding interest receivable\nthat has not been collected is reversed, disclosed accordingly; and therefore, no allowance is established. The Bank believes\nthis policy results in the timely reversal of potentially uncollectible interest.\nManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses\non the Corporation’s loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly\nbasis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of\noperations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions\nbeyond the Corporation’s control.\nNon-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed\nuncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days\ndelinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were previously modified\nfrom their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified as modified loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes\n90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent.\nThe amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the ACL. For\nmodified loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the ACL is segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for\nthose loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their modification period, classified lower than pass, and\ncontaining an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method.\nFor non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated\nallowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an\nindividually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for modified loans) or\ncollateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows certain credit ratios at and for the periods indicated and each component of the ratio’s calculations:\nAt or For The Year Ended June 30,\n(Dollars In Thousands) 2024 2023\nACL on loans as a percentage of total gross loans held for investment at period\nend 0.67 % 0.55 %\nACL on loans $ 7,065 $ 5,946\nTotal gross loans held for investment $ 1,050,846 $ 1,074,164\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of net loans held for investment at period\nend 0.25 % 0.12 %\nTotal non-performing loans, net $ 2,596 $ 1,300\nTotal loans held for investment, net $ 1,052,979 $ 1,077,629\nACL on loans as a percentage of gross non-performing loans at period end 264.71 % 418.14 %\nACL on loans $ 7,065 $ 5,946\nTotal gross non-performing loans $ 2,669 $ 1,422\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans receivable during the period:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family: - % - %\nNet recoveries $ - $ 8\nAverage loans receivable $ 520,071 $ 471,347\nMulti-family: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 459,025 $ 464,511\nCommercial real estate: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 86,425 $ 89,060\nConstruction: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 2,340 $ 2,606\nOther: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 99 $ 111\nCommercial business loans: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 1,592 $ 1,290\nConsumer loans: - % - %\nNet charge-offs $ - $ -\nAverage loans receivable $ 64 $ 75\nTotal loans: - % - %\nTotal net recoveries $ - $ 8\nTotal average loans receivable $ 1,069,616 $ 1,029,000\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe distribution of the ACL on loans at the dates indicated is summarized as follows:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nLoans in Loans in\nEach Each\nCategory Category\nto Total to Total\n(Dollars In Thousands) Amount Loans Amount Loans\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 6,295 49.30 % $ 1,720 48.30 %\nMulti-family 595 42.36 3,270 42.93\nCommercial real estate 66 7.93 868 8.43\nConstruction 97 0.26 15 0.18\nOther 1 0.01 2 0.01\nCommercial business loans 11 0.13 67 0.14\nConsumer loans — 0.01 4 0.01\nTotal ACL $ 7,065 100.00 % $ 5,946 100.00 %\nInvestment Securities Activities\nFederally chartered savings institutions are permitted under federal and state laws to invest in various types of liquid assets,\nincluding U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises and of state\nand municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, certain bankers’\nacceptances, mortgage-backed securities and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings\ninstitutions may also invest a portion of their assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities.\nThe investment policy of the Bank, established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Bank’s Asset-Liability\nCommittee, seeks to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, complement the Bank’s lending activities, and generate a\nfavorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk or credit risk. Investments are made based on certain\nconsiderations, such as credit quality, yield, maturity, liquidity and marketability. The Bank also considers the effect that the\nproposed investment would have on the Bank’s risk-based capital requirements and interest rate risk sensitivity.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank’s investment securities portfolio was $131.9 million and $156.6 million, respectively,\nwhich primarily consisted of federal agency and GSE obligations. The Bank did not purchase any investment securities during\nfiscal 2024 and 2023. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank’s securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with\nan aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States government or its\nagencies or a GSE.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s investment portfolio at the dates indicated:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\nEstimated Estimated\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(Dollars In Thousands) Cost Value Percent Cost Value Percent\nHeld to maturity securities:\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS(1) $ 125,883 $ 110,478 95.04% $ 149,803 $ 131,344 95.39%\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO(2) 3,713 3,460 2.97 3,883 3,547 2.58\nU.S. SBA securities(3) 455 455 0.39 651 650 0.47\nTotal investment securities - held to maturity $ 130,051 $ 114,393 98.40% $ 154,337 $ 135,541 98.44%\nAvailable for sale securities:\nU.S. government agency MBS(1) $ 1,222 $ 1,208 1.04% $ 1,417 $ 1,370 0.99%\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS(1) 548 553 0.48 697 683 0.50\nPrivate issue CMO(2) 91 88 0.08 103 102 0.07\nTotal investment securities - available for sale $ 1,861 $ 1,849 1.60% $ 2,217 $ 2,155 1.56%\nTotal investment securities $ 131,912 $ 116,242 100.00% $ 156,554 $ 137,696 100.00%\n(1) Mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”)\n(2) Collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”)\n(3) Small Business Administration (\"SBA\")\nThe following table sets forth the outstanding balance, maturity and weighted average yield of the investment securities at\nJune 30, 2024.

At June 30, 2024, the Bank reported $15.8 million of unrealized holding losses, which were in a loss position for 12\nmonths or more. The unrealized losses on investment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when\nthe investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities, which are\npredominately GSE securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long\nhistory of no credit losses. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating\nnature of interest rates, and not related to any potential credit risks within the investment portfolio. The Bank does not\ncurrently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale and as such, records the\ninvestment security at book value or fair market value as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(\"U.S. GAAP.\"). As a part of the Bank’s monthly risk assessment, it runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine\nif it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized\ncosts basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Bank’s assessment that it has the ability to hold these held to maturity\nsecurities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs is realized and it is not more likely\nthan not that the Bank will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized costs. There were no ACL on\ninvestment securities held to maturity and there was no impairment on investment securities available for sale at the adoption\ndate of ASC 326 on July 1, 2023 and at June 30, 2024.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment securities\navailable for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until maturity. As\npreviously discussed, it also determined that it was more likely than not that the Bank would not be required to sell the\nsecurities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis; therefore, no impairment losses were recorded on investment securities\navailable for sale and investment securities held to maturity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDeposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes.\nScheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced\nsignificantly by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings through the FHLB – San\n21\nTable of Contents\nFrancisco, Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) of San Francisco and the correspondent bank may be used to compensate for\ndeclines in the availability of funds from other sources.\nDeposit Accounts. Substantially all of the Bank’s depositors are residents of the State of California. Deposits are attracted\nfrom within the Bank’s market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money\nmarket and time deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary, differentiated by the minimum balance required, the time\nperiods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit\naccounts, the Bank considers current interest rates, profitability to the Bank, interest rate risk characteristics, competition and\nits customers’ preferences and concerns. Generally, the Bank’s deposit rates are commensurate with the median rates of its\ncompetitors within a given market. The Bank may occasionally pay above-market interest rates to attract or retain deposits\nwhen less expensive sources of funds are not available. The Bank may also pay above-market interest rates in specific markets\nin order to increase the deposit base of a particular office or group of offices. The Bank reviews its deposit composition and\npricing on a weekly basis.\nThe Bank generally offers time deposits for terms not exceeding seven years. As illustrated in the following table, time\ndeposits represented approximately 31% of the Bank’s deposit portfolio at June 30, 2024, compared to approximately 23% at\nJune 30, 2023. The time deposits included $131.8 million and $106.4 million of brokered certificates of deposit at June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had related party deposits of approximately $6.3 million, compared\nto $8.1 million at June 30, 2023.

The FHLB – San Francisco functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial\ninstitutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB – San Francisco and is authorized to apply\nfor advances using such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (principally investment securities) as\ncollateral, provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different credit\nprograms. Each credit program has its own interest rate, maturity, terms and conditions. Depending on the program,\nlimitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of\ncollateral pledged to secure the credit. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB – San Francisco as an alternative to\ndeposits to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to help manage interest rate\nrisk. The FHLB – San Francisco has served as the Bank’s primary borrowing source.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the FHLB – San Francisco borrowing capacity was limited to 40% of the Bank’s total assets, amounting\nto $516.0 million, as compared to $534.1 million at June 30, 2023. Advances from the FHLB – San Francisco are typically\nsecured by the Bank’s single-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans. Total mortgage loans\npledged to the FHLB – San Francisco were $774.1 million at June 30, 2024 as compared to $967.6 million at June 30,\n2023. In addition, the Bank pledged investment securities totaling $3.9 million and $4.2 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, to collateralize its FHLB – San Francisco advances under the Securities-Backed Credit (“SBC”) facility. At June\n30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had $238.5 million and $235.0 million of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB – San\nFrancisco with a weighted average interest rate of 4.88% and 4.34%, respectively. At June 30, 2024, the outstanding\nborrowings mature between 2024 and 2028 with a weighted average maturity of 13 months.\nIn addition to the total borrowings mentioned above, the Bank utilized its borrowing facility for letters of credit and credit\nenhancement for loans previously sold to the FHLB – San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”)\nprogram which have a recourse liability. The letters of credit are used to collateralize the local agency deposits. The\noutstanding letters of credit were $16.0 million and $11.0 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023; while the outstanding MPF\ncredit enhancement was $216,000 at both June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the remaining financing availability through the FHLB – San Francisco was $261.3 million and\n$287.9 million, with remaining available collateral of $367.4 million and $468.6 million, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank also had secured a discount window facility of $208.6 million and $139.0 million at\nthe FRB of San Francisco, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank collateralized $126.6 million of investment securities\nand $178.6 million of loans held for investment. This compared to a total of $150.3 million of investment securities\ncollateralized under the discount window facility at June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding\nborrowings under the discount window facility at both dates.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million, which\nmatures annually on June 30th. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the federal funds\nfacility with the correspondent bank at both dates.\nAs a member of the FHLB – San Francisco, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB – San Francisco\nstock. The Bank held the required investment in stock at June 30, 2024 and 2023 of $9.6 million and $9.5 million with no\nexcess investment, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank purchased FHLB – San Francisco capital stock totaling $63,000 and $1.3 million,\nrespectively, and did not redeem any of the capital stock during both periods. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the FHLB – San\nFrancisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling $793,000 and $556,000, respectively.\nSubsidiary Activities\nFederal savings institutions generally may invest up to 3% of their assets in service corporations, provided that at least one-\nhalf of any amount in excess of 1% is used primarily for community, inner-city and community development projects. The\nBank’s investment in its service corporations did not exceed these limits at June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n25\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries: PFC, Profed Mortgage, Inc., and First Service Corporation. PFC’s current\nactivities include: (i) acting as trustee for the Bank’s real estate transactions and (ii) holding real estate for investment, if any.\nProfed Mortgage, Inc and First Service Corporation are currently inactive. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank contributed\ncapital of $0 and $10,000 to PFC, respectively. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank’s investment in all its combined\nsubsidiaries totaled $8,000 and $13,000, respectively.\nREGULATION\nThe following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Corporation and the Bank. The\ndescription of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not\npurport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is\nintroduced from time to time in the United States Congress (“Congress”) that may affect the Corporation’s and the Bank’s\noperations. In addition, the regulations governing the Corporation and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the\nOCC, FDIC, FRB and SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect the\noperations and financial condition of the Corporation and the Bank. The Bank cannot predict whether any such changes may\noccur.\nGeneral\nThe Bank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the\nOCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits. The Bank's relationship with its depositors and\nborrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws, which must be complied with by the Bank. The Bank is a member\nof the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the\nOCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into\ncertain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by\nthe OCC to evaluate the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory\nstructure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the\nprotection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive\ndiscretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with\nrespect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for credit loss for regulatory purposes. Any\nchange in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FRB, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the\nCorporation and the Bank and their operations. The Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file\ncertain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB, its\nprimary regulator. The Corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. For\nadditional information, see “Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations” below in this Form 10-K.\nSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Corporation.\nThe description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a\ncomplete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Corporation.\nFederal Regulation of Savings Institutions\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federal savings\ninstitutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic\nexaminations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all federal savings institutions, including\nthe Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-\nand-desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders. In general, these enforcement actions may be\ninitiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the\nbasis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain\ncircumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law.\nAll federal savings institutions must pay assessments to the OCC, to fund the agency’s operations. The general assessments,\npaid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution’s total assets, including\n26\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated subsidiaries. The Bank’s OCC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n$179,000 and $198,000, respectively.\nThe Bank's general permissible lending limit for loans to one borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of\nunimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit\nis increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus). The Bank’s limits on loans to one borrower or group of related\nborrowers at June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $20.1 million and $19.8 million, respectively. At June 30, 2024, the Bank’s largest\nlending relationship to a single borrower or group of borrowers consisted of four multi-family loans totaling $5.0 million,\nwhich were performing according to their original payment terms.\nEffective July 1, 2019, the OCC issued a final rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and\nConsumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) which permits an eligible federal savings bank with assets of $20.0 billion or less as\nof December 31, 2017 to elect to operate with the business powers of a national bank, generally subject to the same limitations\nand restrictions, without converting to a national bank charter. A federal savings bank that makes the so-called “covered\nsavings association” election must divest any activities or investments that are not permitted for a national bank. The Bank had\nnot made such an election as of June 30, 2024.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB – San Francisco, which is one of 11 regional\nFHLBs, each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB - San\nFrancisco is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes\nloans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB,\nwhich are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be\nfully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB - San Francisco. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had\n$238.5 million and $235.0 million of outstanding advances, respectively, from the FHLB – San Francisco with a remaining\navailable credit facility of $261.3 million and $287.9 million, respectively, based on 40% of total assets for both dates, which\nis limited to available collateral. For additional information, see “Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds –\nBorrowings” above in this Form 10-K.\nAs a member of the FHLB - San Francisco, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB – San Francisco.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank held $9.6 million and $9.5 million of FHLB - San Francisco stock, respectively, which\nwere in compliance with this membership requirement. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank was required to purchase\n$63,000 and $1.3 million of FHLB – San Francisco capital stock, respectively, and the Bank did not redeem any capital stock\nduring both periods. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the FHLB – San Francisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling\n$793,000 and $556,000, respectively. There is no guarantee in the future that the FHLB – San Francisco will pay cash\ndividends or redeem excess capital stock held by its members.\nUnder federal law, the FHLB - San Francisco is required to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs\nthrough direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income\nhousing projects. These contributions have in the past adversely affected the level of dividends paid by the FHLB - San\nFrancisco and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of\nFHLB - San Francisco stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank’s FHLB - San Francisco stock may result in a\ncorresponding reduction in the Bank’s capital.\nInsurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures deposits up\nto $250,000 per account owner as defined by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. As an insurer,\nthe FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums in the form of assessments to maintain the DIF and is authorized to conduct\nexaminations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to\nincrease its initial base insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points to improve the likelihood that the reserve ratio\nof the DIF would be restored to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2028. The revised assessment rate schedules became\neffective January 1, 2023, with the first invoice payment date of June 30, 2023 for the assessment period of January 1, 2023\nthrough March 31, 2023. The Bank’s FDIC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n$601,000 and $459,000, respectively.\n27\nTable of Contents\nUnder the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less likely to fail pay lower assessments. Assessments for\ninstitutions of less than $10 billion in assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical\nmodeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the\noperating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound\npractices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule,\norder or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination\nof the Bank’s deposit insurance.\nQualified Thrift Lender Test. Like all savings institutions (subject to a narrow exception not applicable to the Bank), the\nBank is required to meet a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test to avoid certain restrictions on its operations. This test requires\na savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a\nmonthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. As an alternative, a savings institution may maintain 60%\nof its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\nUnder either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments.\nAny savings institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to\nconvert to a national bank charter, and a savings and loan holding company of such an institution may become regulated as a\nbank holding company. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank maintained 92.3% and 92.1% of its portfolio assets in\nqualified thrift investments, respectively, and therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test at both dates. During fiscal 2024\nand 2023, the Bank was in compliance with the QTL test as of each month end.\nCapital Requirements. Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain\nminimum levels of regulatory capital, including a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets leverage ratio, a common equity\nTier 1 (“CET1”) to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio and a total capital to risk-based assets\nratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%,\n(ii) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (iii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; and (iv) a total capital ratio of 8%.\nMortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are also deducted from capital. In\naddition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale debt securities and interest-only strips. Because of the Bank’s asset size, the Bank was given a one-time\noption to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities and interest-\nonly strips in its capital calculations. The Bank elected to exercise this option to opt-out in order to reduce the impact of\nmarket volatility on its regulatory capital levels.\nThe Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-\nweighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends,\nengaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the\nCorporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.\nIn order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Bank must maintain a minimum\nTier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% and a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of 10% and the Bank must not be subject to certain mandates by the OCC requiring it as an individual\ninstitution to meet any specified capital level.\nEGRRCPA required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of\nbetween 8% and 10% for institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion. Institutions with a capital level at or exceeding the\nratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements, and electing the alternative framework, are considered to comply with\nthe applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. Final rules issued by the agencies\nestablished the community bank leverage ratio at 9% of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A\nqualifying institution may opt in or out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly Call Report. An\ninstitution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two quarter grace\n28\nTable of Contents\nperiod to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8%\nor greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Corporation did\nnot opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe FASB has issued a new accounting standard, ASC 326, for U.S. GAAP that was adopted by the Corporation on July 1,\n2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss or CECL requires all entities holding leases that are not\naccounted for at fair value to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader\nrange of assets than the previous method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit\nlosses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of\nthe beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under\nthe current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is\ngenerally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The\nfederal banking regulators (the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option\nto phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. The Bank elected to\nrecognize the full $824,000 adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of CECL on July 1, 2023, instead of\nover the permitted three-year phase-in option.\nPrompt Corrective Action. An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it meets the minimum capital ratios\ndescribed above. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the\nseverity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is\nrequired to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is \"critically undercapitalized.\" OCC regulations also\nrequire that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that\nit is \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" or \"critically undercapitalized.\" Numerous mandatory supervisory\nactions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring\nby regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. In addition, “significantly undercapitalized” and\n“critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to even more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also may\ntake any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the\nreplacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as “well capitalized” under the\nregulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions and on their\nability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other\ntransactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed\ndistribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year up to 100% of net income for the\nyear-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, without regulatory approval. However, an institution\ndeemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or in troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority\nrestricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital\nrequirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it\nmust obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a\ndividend with the FRB. The FRB or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns.\nFurther restrictions on Bank’s dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, if the Bank\ndoes not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation will be limited, which\nmay limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders.\nActivities of Savings Associations and Their Subsidiaries. When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or\nelects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the savings institution controls, the savings institution must file a\nnotice or application with the OCC and in certain circumstances with the FDIC and receive regulatory approval or non-\nobjection. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and\norders. With respect to subsidiaries generally, the OCC may determine that investment by a savings institution in, or the\nactivities of, a subsidiary must be restricted or eliminated based on safety and soundness or legal reasons.\n29\nTable of Contents\nTransactions with Affiliates. The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” is limited by Sections 23A and\n23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the FRB’s Regulation W. The term “affiliates” for these purposes generally\nmean any company that controls or is under common control with an institution except subsidiaries of the institution. The\nCorporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must\nbe on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of\ntransactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution’s capital. Institutions are prohibited from lending to any\naffiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may\npurchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. FDIC-insured institutions are subject, with certain exceptions,\nto certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock\nor other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. Collateral in\nspecified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, these institutions are\nprohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any\nproperty or service.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), every FDIC-insured institution\nhas a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of\nits entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires that the OCC assess the Bank's\nrecord in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, especially low and moderate income neighborhoods. While\nCRA modernization is underway and scheduled for implementation by 2026, the current evaluation system focuses on three\ntests: (1) a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making loans in its assessment areas; (2) an investment test, to\nevaluate the institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting\nlow or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (3) a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of banking\nservices through its branches, ATM centers and other offices. Institutions are assigned a rating of \"outstanding,\"\n\"satisfactory,\" \"needs to improve,\" or \"substantial non-compliance.\" The Bank received a rating of satisfactory when it was\nlast examined for CRA compliance.\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, issued a final rule designed to strengthen and\nmodernize regulations implementing the CRA. The changes are designed to encourage banks to expand access to credit,\ninvestment and banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, adapt to changes in the banking industry\nincluding mobile and internet banking, provide greater clarity and consistency in the application of the CRA regulations and\ntailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type. The applicability date for the majority of the provisions in\nthe CRA regulations is January 1, 2026, and additional requirements will be applicable on January 1, 2027. The Bank cannot\npredict the impact the changes to the CRA will have on its operations at this time.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) was signed into law on October 26, 2001.\nThe USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial\ninstitutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions\nare obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nThese rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking\nto open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to\nconsider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.\nRegulatory and Criminal Enforcement Provisions. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally\nchartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including\nstockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have\nan adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or\ncease-and-desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance.\nCivil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can be nearly $2.0 million per day per violation in especially egregious\ncases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular\nsavings institution. If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances.\nFederal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.\n30\nTable of Contents\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency\nguidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the\nfederal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes\nimpaired. If the OCC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC\nmay require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.\nFederal Reserve System. The FRB requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-\npersonal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional FRB.\nInterest-bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the\ndefinition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits\nat a bank. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0%, which eliminated reserve\nrequirements for all depository institutions.\nEnvironmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation\nand Liability Act (“CERCLA”), is a federal statute, that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present \"owners and\noperators\" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the\nterm \"owner and operator\" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the\nenactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left\nopen the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a\nloan.\nTo the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by\nproperties with potentially hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for\ncleanup costs, which often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy,\nincluding identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of\nestablishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with\nthe ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account\nnumbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy\nAct of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"), which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents the right to request\ndisclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to\nrequest deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of personal information,\nand the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA also created a private right of action with\nstatutory damages for data security breaches, thereby increasing potential liability associated with a data breach, which has\ntriggered a number of class actions against other companies since January 1, 2020. Although the Bank may enjoy several\nfairly broad exemptions from the CCPA's privacy requirements, those exemptions do not extend to the private right of action\nfor a data security breach. The CCPA, including any amendments thereto or final regulations implemented thereunder, as well\nas other similar state data privacy laws and regulations, may require the establishment by the Bank of certain regulatory\ncompliance and risk management controls. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the\nadoption of a final rule providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for\nsignificant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal\nregulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a “computer-security\nincident” rising to the level of a “notification incident” has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization’s operations, its ability\nto deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule\nto notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a\ncomputer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization’s\ncustomers for four or more hours. Compliance with the new rule was required by May 1, 2022.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience and to\ndisclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. The\nnew rules require registrants to disclose on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material and to describe\nthe material aspects of the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its material impact or\n31\nTable of Contents\nreasonably likely material impact on the registrant. The Corporation provided disclosures on its cybersecurity risk\nmanagement and governance on this Form 10-K for fiscal years ended June 20, 2024 (See Part I, Item 1C - Cybersecurity).\nNon-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial\nregulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm. The Bank currently\nhas a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.\nOther Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) exercises broad\nregulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws.\nThe Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less\nthan $10.0 billion in assets, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the OCC with respect to\ncompliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every\naspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-\nLending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership\nand Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check\nClearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with\nthe sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that\nimplement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the\nmanner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and\nproviding other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties,\nincluding but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and\nthe loss of certain contractual rights.\nSavings and Loan Holding Company Regulation\nGeneral. The Corporation is a unitary savings and loan holding company, subject to the regulatory oversight of the FRB.\nAccordingly, the Corporation is required to register and file reports with the FRB and is subject to regulation and examination\nby the FRB. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries,\nwhich also permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the Bank. The FRB\nhas promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” doctrine that require holding companies, including savings\nand loan holding companies, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions\nby providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. These and other FRB policies, as well as the\ncapital conservation buffer may restrict the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends.\nCapital Requirements. For a savings and loan holding company with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets that\nqualifies as a small bank holding company under the FRB’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, such as the\nCorporation, the capital regulations apply to its savings institution subsidiaries, but not the Corporation, unless the FRB\ndetermines otherwise in particular cases. For a description of the capital regulations, see “Federal Regulation of Savings\nInstitutions - Capital Requirements” above.\nActivities Restrictions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) provides that no company may acquire control of a\nsavings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding\ncompanies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA also specifies, subject to a\ngrandfather provision, that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Corporation\nqualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition\nby the Corporation of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Corporation would become a multiple savings\nand loan holding company and would be limited to those activities permitted by FRB regulation. Multiple savings and loan\nholding companies may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, and certain other activities including\nacting as a trustee under a deed of trust and real estate investments.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIf the Bank were to fail the QTL test, the Corporation must, within one year of that failure, register as, and become subject to\nthe restrictions applicable to bank holding companies. For additional information, see “Federal Regulation of Savings\nInstitutions – Qualified Thrift Lender Test” in this Form 10-K.\nMergers and Acquisitions. The Corporation must obtain approval from the FRB before acquiring more than 5% of the voting\nstock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company\nby merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Corporation to acquire control of a\nsavings institution, the FRB would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Corporation\nand the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community,\nincluding performance under the CRA and competitive factors.\nThe FRB may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling\nsavings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) supervisory acquisitions and (ii) the acquisition of a\nsavings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions.\nThe states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.\nAcquisition of the Corporation. Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings\nassociation or savings and loan holding company becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration,\nexamination and regulation by the FRB and must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Savings and Loan Holding\nCompany Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding\ncompany must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control or more\nthan 5% of a class of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to\nregulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term “company” includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and\ncertain trusts and other entities. “Control” of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a\ncompany has voting control, directly or indirectly of more than 25% of any class of the savings association’s voting stock or\ncontrols in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding\ncompany, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding in certain cases 10% or more\nof a class of voting securities. Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more\nother persons. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain FRB approval prior to acquiring voting control of\nmore than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A\nsimilar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company\nis included in the Bank Holding Company Act.\nAccordingly, the prior approval of the FRB would be required:\n● before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common\nstock of the Corporation; and\n● before any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Corporation, and may be required\nfor an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock.\nIn addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and\nloan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the FRB in the case of\ncontrol of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained\nthrough control of a holding company of such savings association.\nFederal Securities Laws. Provident Financial Holdings, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). The Corporation is subject to information, proxy\nsolicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.\nDividends and Stock Repurchases. The FRB’s policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and\nloan holding companies expresses its view that a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital\nposition and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully\nfund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset\nquality, and overall financial condition. The FRB policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company\nexperiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or\nredemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with\nthe net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of\nits consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or any condition imposed by, or\nwritten agreement with, the FRB. As discussed above, the capital conservation buffer requirements may also limit or preclude\ndividends payable by the Corporation.\nTAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. The Corporation reports its income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to\nfederal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank’s\nreserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not\npurport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Corporation.\nTax Bad Debt Reserves. As a result of legislation enacted in 1996, the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves\nwas repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. Due to such repeal, the Bank is no longer able to calculate its\ndeduction for bad debts using the percentage-of-taxable-income or the experience method. Instead, the Bank is permitted to\ndeduct as bad debt expense its specific charge-offs during the taxable year. In addition, the legislation required savings\ninstitutions to recapture into taxable income, over a six-year period, their post 1987 additions to their bad debt tax reserves. As\nof the effective date of the legislation, the Bank had no post 1987 additions to its bad debt tax reserves. As of June 30, 2024,\nthe Bank’s total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes was approximately $9.0 million. Under current law, a savings\ninstitution will not be required to recapture its pre-1988 bad debt reserve unless the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution”\nas defined below. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax\npurposes.\nDistributions. In the event that the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to Provident that are considered as made from\nthe reserve for losses on qualifying real estate property loans, to the extent the reserve for such losses exceeds the amount that\nwould have been allowed under the experience method or from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans (“Excess\nDistributions”), then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend\ndistributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in\nredemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank’s current or\naccumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a\ndistribution from the Bank’s bad debt reserve. Thus, any dividends to Provident that would reduce amounts appropriated to the\nBank’s bad debt reserve and deducted for federal income tax purposes would create a tax liability for the Bank. The amount of\nadditional taxable income attributable to an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the\nincome, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution,” then approximately\none and one-half times the amount distributed will be included in taxable income for federal income tax purposes. For\nadditional information, see \"Regulation - Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Limitations on Capital Distributions” in\nthis Form 10-K for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would\nresult in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve. During fiscal 2024, the Bank declared and paid $7.0 million of\ncash dividends to Provident, while Provident declared and paid $3.9 million of cash dividends to shareholders.\nExcise Tax on Stock Repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a one percent excise tax on the value of\ncorporate share repurchases (net of issuance). On December 27, 2022, the Internal Revenue Services issued Note 2023-2\nwhich provides interim guidance on the implementation of the excise tax on stock repurchases. The excise tax is a non-\ndeductible tax of one percent of the fair market value of the Corporation’s stock repurchases, net of restricted stock\ndistributions, stock option exercises, ESOP repurchases and contributions and other qualified activities, occurring after\nDecember 31, 2022 in excess of $1.0 million. The excise tax on the stock repurchases in fiscal 2024 was $26,000.\n34\nTable of Contents\nTax Effect from Stock-Based Compensation. During fiscal 2024, there were no shares of restricted common stock vested\nand distributed to employees but there were 2,000 shares of restricted stock distributed to non-employee members of the\nCorporation’s Board of Directors. Also, there were no non-qualified stock options exercised and no incentive stock options\nexercised as disqualifying dispositions, but there were 39,220 shares of non-qualified stock options that expired and/or were\nforfeited and 3,350 shares of restricted stock that were forfeited. As a result, there was a $38,000 adjustment to federal tax\nexpense from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2024.\nOther Matters. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bank’s income tax returns through 1996 and the California\nFranchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the\nCorporation’s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the\nCorporation’s income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal 2022 and fiscal years thereafter remain subject to federal\nexamination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal 2021 and fiscal years thereafter are subject to examination by\nstate taxing authorities.\nState Taxation\nCalifornia. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the Bank, equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations\ngenerally, plus an “in lieu” rate of 2%, which is approximately equal to personal property taxes and business license taxes paid\nby such corporations (but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the Corporation). At June 30, 2024, the\nCorporation’s net state tax rate was 8.5%. Bad debt deductions are available in computing California franchise taxes using the\nspecific charge-off method. The Bank and its California subsidiaries file California franchise tax returns on a combined basis.\nThe Corporation will be treated as a general corporation subject to the general corporate tax rate. There was $22,000\nadjustment to state tax expense from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2024.\nDelaware. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Corporation is exempted from Delaware\ncorporate income tax, but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of\nDelaware. During fiscal 2024, the Corporation paid franchise taxes of $200,000.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Bank had 160 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 94 full-time, 66 prime-time and no\npart-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and management believes that its\nrelationship with employees is good.\nTo facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make the Bank an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with\nopportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by market-based compensation, benefits,\nhealth and welfare programs. At June 30, 2024, approximately 73.0% of our workforce was female and 27.0% male, and our\naverage employee tenure was approximately 8.3 years, down slightly from an average employee tenure of 8.5 years at June\n30, 2023. The ethnicity of our workforce was 40.5% White, 42.2% Hispanic or Latino, 6.5% African American or Black, 6.0%\nAsian, 2.7% two or more races, 0.5% American Indian or Alaskan Native and 1.6% Not Specified. As part of our\ncompensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market competitive compensation programs for our employees in order to\nattract and retain superior talent. In addition to strong base wages, additional programs include quarterly or annual bonus\nopportunities, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, a Corporation-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits,\nflexible spending accounts, accrued vacation and sick time, family leave, and an employee assistance program.\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the\nhealth, safety, and wellness of our employees. In support of our commitment, we provide our employees and their families\nwith access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical\nand mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status; and that offer choice,\nwhere possible, so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\nA core value of our talent management approach is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires.\nThis approach has yielded loyalty and dedication in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our commitment to\nour communities, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous\n35\nTable of Contents\nimprovement mindset. We believe that our average employee tenure of over eight years reflects the engagement of our\nemployees in this talent management philosophy. Turnover for employees, as measured by terminated employees to the\naverage total employees, was 23.3% in fiscal 2024, down from 41.4% in fiscal 2023.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the executive officers of the Provident and the Bank:\nPosition\nName Age(1) Provident Bank\nDonavon P.

Risk Factors\nWe assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business. In addition to the risk factors described\nbelow, other risks and uncertainties not specifically mentioned, or that are currently known to, or deemed by, management to\nbe immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and/or cash flows. Before\nmaking an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other\ninformation included in this Form 10-K. If any of the circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, the\nvalue of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which\nwe depend.\nAs of June 30, 2024, approximately 66% of our real estate loans were secured by collateral and made to borrowers located in\nSouthern California with the balance located predominantly throughout the rest of California. A return of recessionary\nconditions or adverse economic conditions in California may reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers' ability to repay\nloans and adversely impact our capital, liquidity, financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including\ninflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, may also adversely affect our profitability. Weakness in the global\neconomy and global supply chain issues have adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent\nupon international trade. Changes in agreements or relationships between the United States and other countries may also affect\nthese businesses.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in our market areas could result in the following consequences, any of which could\nhave a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n● an increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures;\n● an increase in our ACL;\n● the slowing of sales of foreclosed assets;\n● a decline in demand for our products and services;\n● a decline in the value of collateral for loans may in turn reduce customers' borrowing power, and the value of assets\nand collateral associated with existing loans;\n● the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n● a decrease in the amount of our low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits.\n37\nTable of Contents\nA decline in California economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and\ncapital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Many of the loans in\nour portfolio are secured by real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for a mortgage loan is located\ncould negatively affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Real estate\nvalues are affected by various other factors, including changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules\nor policies and natural disasters such as fires, droughts and earthquakes. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of\ncollateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nExternal economic factors, such as changes in monetary policy and inflation and deflation, may have an adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the FRB.\nActions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the FRB, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic\nphenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. Inflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 and, while\ndissipating, remains elevated. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as\nthey are not able to leverage economies of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the\nability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly,\nwhich would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation\ncould cause wages and other costs to the Corporation to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates tend to have a\nmore significant impact on our performance than general levels of inflation or deflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move\nin the same direction or by the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt June 30, 2024, $518.1 million, or 49% of our loans held for investment, were secured by single-family residential real\nproperty. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly impact\nthe ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Jumbo single-family\nloans which do not conform to secondary market mortgage requirements for our market areas are not immediately saleable in\nthe secondary market and may expose us to increased risk because of their larger balances. Higher market interest rates,\nrecessionary conditions or declines in the volume of single-family real estate sales and/or the sales prices as well as elevated\nunemployment rates, may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our\nproducts and services. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity\nand damage our financial condition and business operations.\nA few of our legacy residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity\nbecause either we originated a first mortgage with an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a concurrent second mortgage for a\ncombined loan-to-value ratio of up to 100% or because of a decline in home values in our market areas. Residential loans with\nhigh loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value\nratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses.\nOur multi-family and commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment\nof these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWe originate multi-family and commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are\nsecured by residential and non-residential properties. At June 30, 2024, we had $528.5 million or 50% of total loans held for\ninvestment in multi-family and commercial real estate loans. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than\nother types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an\nadverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss\ncompared to an adverse development with respect to a single-family residential loan. Repayment on these loans typically is\ndependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan\n38\nTable of Contents\nin amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the\neconomy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower's project is reduced as a result of leases\nnot being obtained or renewed, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Multi-family and commercial real\nestate loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by single-family residential real estate because the\ncollateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as single-family residential real estate. In addition, many of\nour multi-family and commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity,\nwhich would require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property to make the balloon payment at maturity,\nthus increasing the risk of default or non-payment.\nA secondary market for many types of multi-family and commercial real estate loans is not readily liquid, so we have less\nopportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we\nforeclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a\nsingle-family residential mortgage loan because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs\non multi-family and commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred within the single-\nfamily residential loan portfolio.\nWe occasionally purchase loans in bulk or “pools.” We may experience lower yields or losses on loan “pools” because\nthe assumptions we use when purchasing loans in bulk may not prove correct.\nIn order to achieve our loan growth objectives and/or improve earnings, we may purchase loans, either individually, through\nparticipations, or in bulk. We did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2024 and 2023. When we determine the purchase price we\nare willing to pay to purchase loans in bulk, management makes certain assumptions about, among other things, how fast\nborrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market, our ability to collect on loans successfully and, if necessary, our\nability to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. In addition, when we purchase loans, we\nperform certain due diligence procedures and typically require customary limited indemnities. To the extent that our\nunderlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change, the purchase price paid for “pools”\nof loans may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For\nexample, if we purchase pools of loans at a premium and some of the loans are prepaid before we modeled, we will earn less\ninterest income on the purchase than expected. Our success in growing our loan portfolio through purchases of loan “pools”\ndepends on our ability to price loan “pools” properly and on the general economic conditions within the geographic areas\nwhere the underlying properties of the purchased loans are located.\nAcquiring loans through bulk purchases may involve acquiring loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may\nnot have substantial prior experience. We may be exposed to a greater risk of loss to the extent that bulk purchases contain\nsuch loans.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nOur business relies significantly on the creditworthiness of our customers. To account for potential defaults and\nnonperformance in our loan portfolio, we maintain an ACL on loans using the CECL methodology. This allowance represents\nmanagement's best estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is\ndetermined by management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n● our collective allowance, for loans evaluated on a pool basis with similar risk characteristics based on our and peer\nlife of loan historical loss experience, certain qualitative factors consisting of macroeconomic conditions and\nexternal factors as regulatory requirements, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relating to management’s\nexpectations of future events; and\n● our individual allowance, for evaluation of individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics based on the\npresent value of the expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nThe determination of the appropriate ACL involves a significant degree of subjectivity, relying on substantial estimates of both\ncurrent credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to potential material changes. Inaccuracies in our estimations\ncould lead to an insufficient ACL, necessitating increases through provisions for credit losses, adversely impacting our\nrecorded income.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFurther, included in our single-family residential loan portfolio, which comprised 49% of our total loan portfolio at June 30,\n2024, were $17.7 million or 2% of total loans held for investment that were non-traditional single-family loans, which include\nnegative amortization and more than 30-year amortization loans, stated income loans and low FICO score loans, all of which\nhave a higher risk of default and loss than conforming residential mortgage loans. Additionally, as we acknowledge the\npotential impact of significant portfolio growth, new loan products, and refinancing activities, these actions may result in\nportfolios consisting of unseasoned loans that may not perform as anticipated, elevating the risk of an inadequate allowance to\nabsorb losses without additional provisions. A material decrease in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, significant changes\nin the risk profile of markets, industries, or customer groups, or inadequacy in the ACL could have a materially adverse impact\non our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations.\nBank regulatory agencies also periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or\nthe recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their\nexamination.\nIf charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we may need additional provisions to increase the ACL. Any increases in the\nACL will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition and could result in further losses in the future.\nNon-performing assets, consisting of non-performing loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure, adversely affect our\nearnings in various ways. We reverse accrued interest on non-performing loans and do not record interest income on\nforeclosed assets. Additionally, non-performing loans increase our loan administration costs and costs also increase due to the\nimprovement, maintenance and repairs of the foreclosed assets. Upon foreclosure or similar proceedings, we record the\nrepossessed asset at the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, which may result in a write-down or loss. A significant increase\nin the level of non-performing assets from current levels would also increase our risk profile and may impact the capital levels\nour regulators believe are appropriate in light of the increased risk profile. While we attempt to reduce problem assets through\nvarious means such as collection efforts, asset sales, workouts and modifications, a decline in the value of the underlying\ncollateral or in the borrower’s performance or financial condition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets often requires a significant time commitment from\nmanagement, diverting their attention from other aspects of our operations.\nRisks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes\nFluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many\nfactors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and\nregulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Beginning in March 2022, in response to high inflation, the FOMC\ncommenced increasing the target range for the federal funds rates by implementing multiple increases. As of June 30, 2024,\nthe FOMC target range for the federal funds rate was 5.25% to 5.50% as economic conditions remained relatively resilient and\ninflation remained elevated. As inflation eases, the FOMC has indicated rate decreases may be expected during the second\nhalf of 2024, although to date that has not been the case. However, if the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds\nrate, overall interest rates will likely continue to rise, which will negatively impact our net interest income and may negatively\nimpact both the housing market, by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases, and the U.S. economy.\nWe principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. If we\nare unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nmaterially affected.\nA sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. As is the case with many financial\ninstitutions, we attempt to increase our proportion of deposits comprising either no or relatively low-interest-bearing accounts,\nwhich has been challenging over the last couple of years. At June 30, 2024, we had $245.7 million in time\n40\nTable of Contents\ndeposits that mature within one year, $95.6 million in noninterest-bearing checking accounts and $518.8 million in interest-\nbearing checking, savings and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a\nrising interest rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other\ninvestments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nIn addition, most of our mortgage loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of\ndefault in a rising interest rate environment.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our securities portfolio available for sale. Generally, the fair value of fixed-\nrate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale\nare reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for\nsale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders’ equity.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential\neffects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market\ninterest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate\nrisk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on\nour consolidated balance sheet or projected operating results. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates\non our loan portfolio, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Form 10-K.\nCertain hedging strategies that we may use to manage investment in mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for\nsale and interest rate lock commitments may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets\ndue to changes in interest rates and market liquidity.\nWe may use derivative instruments to economically hedge mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for sale and interest\nrate lock commitments to offset changes in fair value resulting from changing interest rate environments. Our hedging\nstrategies are susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among\nother factors. In addition, hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors.\nIf these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of\nchanges in interest rates, we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings.\nWe may incur losses on our securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly impact the fair value of securities within our portfolio, potentially leading to\nadverse changes in their value. These factors include, but are not limited to, actions taken by rating agencies regarding the\nsecurities, defaults by the issuer, adverse events affecting either the issuer or the underlying securities, and shifts in market\ninterest rates along with continued instability in the capital markets. These influences could result in impairments that are not\njust temporary, leading to realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods. Such developments could also lead to declines in\nother comprehensive income, thereby potentially affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations in a\nsignificant manner. We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for expected credit losses based on Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,” since the adoption on July 1, 2023. The process\nusually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any\ncollateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the\nsecurity. Despite our efforts to evaluate these factors, there can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result\nin credit losses on these assets. Such credit losses could lead to accounting charges that might materially impact our net\nincome and capital levels. There were no ACL on investment securities held to maturity at adoption of ASC 326 or at June 30,\n2024 and there were no impairment on investment securities available for sale at June 30, 2024.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Matters\nWe are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change\nthe treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\nOur business operations are significantly influenced by the extensive body of accounting regulations in the United States.\nRegulatory bodies periodically issue new guidance, altering accounting rules and reporting requirements, which can\nsubstantially affect the preparation and reporting of our financial statements. These changes might necessitate retrospective\napplication, potentially leading to restatements of prior period financial statements.\nOne such significant change in fiscal 2024 was the implementation of the CECL model, which we adopted on July 1, 2023.\nUnder the CECL model, financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, are\npresented at the net amount expected to be collected. This forward-looking approach in estimating expected credit losses\ncontrasts starkly with the prior, \"incurred loss\" model, which delays recognition until a loss is probable. CECL mandates\nconsidering historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts affecting collectability, leading to periodic\nadjustments of financial asset values. However, this forward-looking methodology, reliant on macroeconomic variables,\nintroduces the potential for increased earnings volatility due to unexpected changes in these indicators between periods. An\nadditional consequence of CECL is an accounting asymmetry between loan-related income, recognized periodically based on\nthe effective interest method, and credit losses, recognized upfront at origination. This asymmetry might create the perception\nof reduced profitability during loan expansion periods due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Conversely,\nperiods with stable or declining loan levels might seem relatively more profitable as income accrues gradually for loans where\nlosses had been previously recognized.\nAs a result of the change in methodology from the incurred loss model to the CECL model, on July 1, 2024, the Corporation\nrecorded a one-time, net of tax charge of $824,000 to retained earnings, a $1.2 million increase to the ACL for credit losses for\nloans, and no change to the ACL on unfunded loan commitments.\nNon-compliance with the USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or\nsanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions.\nThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions\nfrom being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated\nto file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules\nrequire financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open\nnew financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get\nregulatory approval of acquisitions. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with\nthese laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing\nviolations of these laws and regulations.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer\nunexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical\nto optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report,\nanalyze, and control the types of risk to which we are subject to. These risks include, among others, liquidity, credit, market,\ninterest rate, operational, legal and compliance, and reputational risk. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling\nmethodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. We also maintain a compliance program to identify,\nmeasure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies, and procedures. While we assess and improve these\nprograms on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other\nrelated controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us.\nHowever, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as they\nmay exist, or develop in the future, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk\nmanagement framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse\nregulatory consequences.\n42\nTable of Contents\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect our business and results of\noperations.\nClimate change continues to be a pressing concern, prompting heightened awareness and action on a global scale. Efforts\ninclude international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, with the United States rejoining, and ongoing initiatives at\nvarious governmental levels to address climate-related issues. Under the current administration, additional measures are\nanticipated, potentially impacting banks' risk management practices, stress testing, credit portfolio concentrations, and\ninvestment strategies. The lack of empirical data makes it challenging to predict the precise financial impact of climate\nchange, though its physical effects, such as more frequent weather disasters, could directly affect our real estate collateral and\nloan portfolios. Inadequate insurance coverage for borrowers may compound these risks, impacting our financial condition.\nFurthermore, climate change's broader economic effects could adversely affect our customers and the communities we serve,\npotentially impacting our financial performance.\nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC implemented new climate-related disclosure rules for U.S. public companies and foreign private\nissuers. These rules introduce extensive disclosure requirements, increasing reporting costs, risks, and complexity. Challenges\ninclude short compliance timelines, interpretive issues, legal liabilities, and global regulatory overlaps. Lawsuits contesting\nthese rules add further uncertainty. However, on March 15, 2024, the Fifth Circuit granted an administrative stay, temporarily\nhalting the implementation of the SEC's climate rules.\nOur litigation related costs may increase.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the Bank's business. Our\ninvolvement in litigation may increase significantly. The expenses of some legal proceedings will adversely affect our results\nof operations until they are resolved. Further, there can be no assurance that loan workouts and other activities will not expose\nus to additional legal actions, including lender liability or environmental claims.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems\nare essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger\nand virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of\nconfidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and\nendeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be\nvulnerable to breaches, fraudulent or unauthorized access, denial or degradation of service attacks, misuse, computer viruses,\nmalware or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this\ncould jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through,\nour computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of\nour customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial\nlosses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer\nsignificant reputational damage.\nFurther, our cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third party processing\nservices. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third party’s information systems or their payment\nprocessors. Such a data security breach could compromise our customer’s account information. The payment methods that we\noffer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to\nobtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with\napplicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a\nbreach or misuse of data, we may be liable for losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent\ntransactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or\nmay be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be\nimpaired. We may also incur other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards\n43\nTable of Contents\nassociated with compromised card accounts or credit monitoring services. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in\ncertain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that\nmay result in higher costs.\nBreaches of information security may also occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our\nsystems, our customers’ or counterparties’ confidential information, including employees. We are continuously working to\ninstall new, and upgrade our existing, information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around\nransomware, phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to further protect the Corporation against cyber risks and security\nbreaches.\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services\nindustry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We are\nregularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information\ntechnology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse,\ncomputer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are\nincreasingly a concern for companies, including ours. We are not aware that we have experienced any material\nmisappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a\ncyber-security breach or other act, however, some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which could\nincrease their risks of identity theft, debit and card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with\nus.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation.\nIncreases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in\nthird party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or\nbreach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us,\nour customers and underlying transactions. Any compromise of our security could deter customers from using our internet\nbanking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on internet security systems to provide the\nsecurity and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Although we have developed and continue to invest\nin systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our\nsecurity, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could\nresult in losses to us or our customers, our loss of business and/or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of\nadditional expenses, disruption to our business, our inability to grow our online services or other businesses, additional\nregulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and\nprocedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will\nnot occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing\nand other operational functions to certain third-party providers. While we select our third-party vendors carefully, we do not\ncontrol their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties including those resulting from breakdowns or other\ndisruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher transaction\nvolumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches or if we otherwise have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to\nadequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our ability to deliver products and services to our\ncustomers and otherwise conduct business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party vendors could\nalso entail significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information\nthrough various other vendors and their personnel. We cannot ensure that such breaches, failures or interruptions will not\noccur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be\ninsured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all\nlosses resulting from breaches, system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience\nfinancial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be\nrequired to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as\nfavorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend\nsubstantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and\nresult in a loss of customers and\n44\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nWe are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial\nlosses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer’s information,\nmisappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent\nactivity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other\ndishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced\nlosses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such\nlosses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity\ndemands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments and our securities\nportfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through\ndeposits, borrowings or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources\nin amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically,\nor the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity\nsources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the California markets in which our\nloans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be\nimpaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations\nabout the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding in\namounts adequate to finance our activities on acceptable terms could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in\nsecurities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands,\nany of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See\n“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital\nResources” of this Form 10-K.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day\noperations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the\ncontracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the\ncontracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor’s organizational structure, financial\ncondition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our\noperations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also\ncould be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by a third party vendor or is renewed on terms less\nfavorable to us. Additionally, the bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of our\nvendors’ performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical\ninfrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the\nnetworks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition,\nregulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional\ncompliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally,\nunethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies,\nand questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect\n45\nTable of Contents\nour reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity\nregarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and\nemployees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be\navailable when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be exceedingly high.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability\nto raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our\ncontrol, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise\nadditional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our\nability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may dilute the interests of existing holders of\nour common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be\nsubject to adverse regulatory action.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with\nthose changes, we will not be able to effectively compete.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and\nservices. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use\ntechnology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our\noperations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to\ncompete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater\nresources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new\ntechnologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-\ndriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our\nability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nEarthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters in our primary market area may result in material losses\nbecause of damage to collateral properties and borrowers' inability to repay loans.\nSince our geographic concentration is in California, we are subject to earthquakes, fires, mudslides, droughts and other natural\ndisasters. A major earthquake or other natural disaster may disrupt our business operations for an indefinite period of time and\ncould result in material losses, although we have not experienced any losses in many years as a result of earthquake damage or\nother natural disaster. Although we are in an earthquake prone area, we and other lenders in the market area may not require\nearthquake insurance as a condition of making a loan. In addition to possibly sustaining damage to our own properties, if there\nis a major earthquake, fire, mudslide, or other natural disaster, we face the risk that many of our borrowers may experience\nuninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms\nof their loan obligations.\nAny breach of representations and warranties made by us to our loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales\nmay require us to repurchase or substitute such loans we have sold.\nWe have previously engaged in bulk loan sales pursuant to agreements that generally require us to repurchase or substitute\nloans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by us to the loan purchaser. Any misrepresentation during\nthe mortgage loan origination process or, in some cases, upon any fraud or early payment default on such mortgage loans, may\nrequire us to repurchase or substitute loans. Any claims asserted against us in the future by one of our loan purchasers may\nresult in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial\ncondition. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank did not repurchase any loans. Additionally, the Bank did not have any\nclaims or settlements for previously sold loans during fiscal 2024 and 2023.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOur assets as of June 30, 2024 include a deferred tax asset, the full value of which we may not be able to realize.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the\ntax basis of assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2024, the net deferred tax asset was approximately $606,000, an increase from\n$218,000 at the prior fiscal year end. The net deferred tax asset results primarily from (1) deferred loan costs, (2) provisions\nfor credit losses recorded for financial reporting purposes, which were in the past significantly larger than net loan charge-offs\ndeducted for tax reporting proposes and (3) deferred compensation, among others.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future\nearnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on\nthe existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income.\nWe believe the recorded net deferred tax asset at June 30, 2024 is fully realizable based on our expected future earnings;\nhowever, expected future earnings may not be realized, which could impact our deferred tax assets.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with\nrespect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or\nadditional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their\nenvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and\ninfluential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and\nsafety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our\noverall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations\nand standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New\ngovernment regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and\nvoluntary reporting, due diligence, and disclosure.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level.\nWe are an entity separate and distinct from our principal subsidiary, the Bank, and derive substantially all of our revenue at the\nholding company level in the form of dividends from that subsidiary. Accordingly, we are, and will continue to be, dependent\nupon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, to satisfy our other cash needs, to pay\nfor share buybacks and to pay dividends on our common stock. The Bank's ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to\nearn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may\nnot be able to pay dividends on our common stock nor share buybacks. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets\nupon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. In fiscal 2024 and\n2023, the Bank paid cash dividends to its holding company totaling $7.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nManaging technology risks, including cybersecurity risks, is a fundamental part of the Corporation’s risk management\nframework and processes. The Corporation employs a variety of processes, risk assessments, and controls to assess, identify,\nand manage these risks. This includes estimating the likelihood and potential impact of cybersecurity incidents. To manage\nthese risks, the Corporation designs, documents, and implements controls, which are then tested through compliance\nassessments and internal and external audits. In some cases, the Corporation also transfers risk, either wholly or partially,\nthrough insurance and other methods. When an incident occurs, the Corporation responds by remediating the incident while\ncomplying with regulatory obligations, and then evaluates the remediation’s effectiveness. Communication about risk\nmanagement matters is conducted through documented policies and procedures, management and Board\n47\nTable of Contents\ncommittee reporting, and employee training and communications. For a detailed description of how cybersecurity risks may\nmaterially affect the Corporation’s business strategy or results, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nThe Corporation’s information technology risk management department consists of professionals with experience and\nexpertise in cybersecurity, including specialists in identity and access management, cyber defense operations, security\nengineering, and information technology governance, risk, and compliance. This department is led by the Chief Information\nOfficer (“CIO”), who has over 27 years of experience in technology risk management, and the Information Security Officer\n(“ISO”), who has a bachelor in computer science and has over 18 years of experience in cybersecurity risk management. The\nISO reports to the CIO, and the CIO reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the\nCorporation engages third-party experts as needed to assess, manage, and respond to cybersecurity risks through various\nmethods, including risk assessments, IT audits based on different frameworks, penetration and vulnerability testing, social\nengineering, incident response, threat intelligence, education, and managed security services.\nThe Corporation also monitors risks from third parties, such as service providers, through efforts like monitoring, information\nsharing, risk assessments, audits, contractual due diligence, and adherence to third-party security standards. Senior\nmanagement governs risk management and is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and\nmediation of cybersecurity incidents. This is facilitated through working review committees, on which the ISO and/or CIO\nserve. These committees receive risk management reports appropriate to their scope of review, covering assessment results,\nrisk ratings, and critical issues. They report significant matters to enterprise-wide risk committees, which oversee the broader\nscope of risk management for the enterprise. Through these efforts, senior management makes decisions and sets priorities for\nallocating resources to address risk management issues.\nThe Corporation’s Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, oversees all risk management policies, procedures, and\npractices, including those related to cybersecurity. Senior management generally reports quarterly, or more frequently as\nnecessary, to the Enterprise Risk Committee on technology risks, including those from cybersecurity threats. The Board’s\nAudit Committee and the Board of Directors receive these reports as part of their risk management oversight responsibilities.\nBoard members have direct access to senior management and other relevant personnel and may direct questions and request\nfurther information as needed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities.\nItem 2. Properties\nAt June 30, 2024, the net book value of the Corporation’s properties (including land and buildings) and its furniture, fixtures\nand equipment was $8.0 million. The Corporation’s home office is located in Riverside, California. Including the home office,\nthe Corporation has 13 retail banking offices, 12 of which are located in Riverside County in the cities of Riverside (5),\nMoreno Valley, Hemet, Sun City, Rancho Mirage, Corona, Temecula and Blythe. One office is located in Redlands, San\nBernardino County, California. The Corporation owns six of the retail banking offices and has seven leased retail banking\noffices. The lease term maturity dates range from 2024 to 2029, some of which has remaining extension options. In the\nopinion of management, all properties are adequately covered by insurance, are in a good state of repair and are appropriately\ndesigned for their present and future use.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nPeriodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens,\ncondemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and\nservicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the\nCorporation’s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual\nmatters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the\nCorporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it\nbelieves would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nMarket Information and Holders\nThe common stock of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n“PROV.” At August 15, 2024, there were 400 shareholders of record, and there were approximately 1,917 persons or entities\nthat hold stock in nominee or “street name” accounts with brokers.\nDividends\nThe Corporation’s cash dividend payout policy is reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors. The Board\nof Directors has declared quarterly cash dividends on the Corporation’s common stock for consecutive quarters since\nSeptember 30, 2002. On April 25, 2024, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share with a record\ndate of May 16, 2024 and the dividend was paid on June 6, 2024. Future declarations or payments of dividends will be subject\nto the consideration of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, which will take into account the Corporation’s financial\ncondition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, legal restrictions, economic\nconditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the\nCorporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for\nthe current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared. No assurances can be given that any\ndividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods. Dividends on common stock from\nProvident depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is Provident’s predominant source of income.\nManagement’s projections show an expectation that cash dividends will continue for the foreseeable future.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nOn September 28, 2023, the Board approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing the purchase of up to 350,353 shares of the\nCorporation’s outstanding common stock over a one-year period. Simultaneously, the Board canceled the remaining 25,428\nshares available for purchase under the prior repurchase plan. The Corporation may purchase the shares from time to time in\nthe open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the\nCorporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. The\nSeptember 2023 stock repurchase plan terminates on September 28, 2024, unless completed sooner or extended.\nThe table below sets forth information regarding the Corporation’s purchases of its common stock during the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2024.\nMaximum\nTotal Number of Number of Shares\nShares Purchased as that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Average Price Part of Publicly Purchased Under\nPeriod Shares Purchased Paid per Share Announced Plan the Plan(1)\nApril 1, 2024 – April 30, 2024 18,351 $ 13.52 18,351 219,241\nMay 1, 2024 – May 31, 2024 18,494 $ 12.71 18,494 200,747\nJune 1, 2024 – June 30, 2024 11,631 $ 12.64 11,631 189,116\nTotal 48,476 $ 13.00 48,476 189,116\n(1) Represents the remaining shares available for future purchases under the September 2023 stock repurchase plan.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on the Corporation’s common stock with the\ncumulative total return of the Nasdaq Stock Index (U.S. Stock) and Nasdaq Bank Index.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSafe-Harbor Statement\nCertain matters discussed in this Form 10-K constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to the Corporation’s financial condition, liquidity, results of\noperations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. You should not place undue reliance on these statements as they\nare subject to various risks and uncertainties. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind\nthese risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Corporation may make. Moreover, you should treat\nthese statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the\nCorporation.\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and\nthese forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or\nimplied by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n● adverse economic conditions in our local market areas or other markets where we have lending relationships\n● effects of employment levels, labor shortages, inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth;\n● changes in the interest rate environment, including the past increases in the Federal Reserve benchmark rate and the\nduration of such increased levels, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and\nobligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity;\n● the impact of inflation and the Federal Reserve monetary policy;\n● the effects of any Federal government shutdown;\n● credit risks of lending activities, including loan delinquencies, write-offs, changes in our ACL, and provision for\ncredit losses;\n● increased competitive pressures;\n● quality and composition of our securities portfolio and the impact of adverse changes in the securities markets;\n● quality and composition of our securities portfolio and the impact of adverse changes in the securities markets;\n● fluctuations in deposits;\n● secondary market conditions for loans and our ability to sell loans in the secondary market;\n● liquidity issues, including our ability to borrow funds or raise additional capital, if necessary;\n● expectations regarding key growth initiatives and strategic priorities;\n● the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking\nindustry in general on investor and depositor sentiment;\n● results of examinations of us by regulatory authorities, which may the possibility that any such regulatory authority\nmay, among other things, institute a formal or informal enforcement action against us or our bank subsidiary which\ncould require us to increase our ACL, write-down assets, change our regulatory capital position or affect our ability\nto borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits or impose additional requirements or restrictions on us, any of\nwhich could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings;\n● legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in banking, securities and tax law, in regulatory policies and\nprinciples, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules;\n● use of estimates in determining the fair value of assets, which may prove incorrect;\n● disruptions or security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in or attacks on our information\ntechnology systems or on the our third-party vendors;\n● staffing fluctuations in response to product demand or corporate implementation strategies;\n● our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n● environmental, social and governance goals;\n● effects of climate change, severe weather events, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other public health\ncrises, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest and other external events;\n● and other factors described in this Form 10-K and in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with\nand furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which are available on our website at\nwww.myprovident.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n51\nTable of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made. We undertake\nno obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this document or to update the reasons\nwhy actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this document\nmight not occur, and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These factors could cause our\nactual results for the fiscal 2025 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements by, or\non behalf of, us and could negatively affect the Corporation’s consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of\noperations as well as its stock price performance.\nGeneral\nProvident, a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of the\nBank upon the Bank’s conversion completed on June 27, 1996. Provident is regulated by the FRB. At June 30, 2024, the\nCorporation, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of $1.27 billion, total deposits of $888.3 million and total stockholders’\nequity of $129.9 million. Provident has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank.\nAccordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the\nBank and its subsidiaries.\nThe Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is\nregulated by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, the insurer of its deposits. The Bank’s deposits are\nfederally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System\nsince 1956.\nThe Corporation operates in a single business segment through the Bank. The Bank's activities include attracting deposits,\noffering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and,\nto a lesser extent, other mortgage (generally land loans), commercial business and consumer loans. Deposits are collected\nprimarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. Loans are primarily\noriginated and purchased in Southern and Northern California to be held for investment. There are various risks inherent in the\nCorporation’s business including, among others, the general business environment, interest rates, the California real estate\nmarket, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the repurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary\nmarket conditions to sell loans, competitive conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in\nunderstanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. The information contained in this section\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying selected Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Corporation’s\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make difficult, subjective\nor complex judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and, therefore, management considers\nthe following to be critical accounting estimates. These estimates involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time they are\nmade, and changes in these estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates\nthat we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We base our\nestimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate\nthese estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our\nBoard of Directors. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses.\nThe ACL involves significant judgment and assumptions by management, which has a material impact on the carrying value\nof financial assets. The Corporation adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2023\nare presented under CECL while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable\naccounting standards.\nAs required by ASC 326, on July 1, 2023 the Corporation implemented CECL and recognized a $1.2 million one-time\nincrease to its ACL, which was recorded directly to retained earnings. Under ASC 326, the ACL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from the related loan’s amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The\nmeasurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses\non the Corporation’s loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly\nbasis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of\noperations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions\nbeyond the Corporation’s control.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Management accounts for income taxes by estimating future tax effects of temporary\ndifferences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws. These\ndifferences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are\nvoluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, management is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments\nregarding the Corporation’s income tax exposures, including judgments in determining the amount and timing of recognition\nof the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income. Interpretations of and\nguidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in management’s subjective\nassumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nand Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExecutive Summary and Operating Strategy\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and\nsmall to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations\nas Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, PFC. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank,\nconsist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the\nBank.\nCommunity banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding\nthe Bank’s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Also,\nto a lesser extent, the Bank originates construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The primary\nsource of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on\nloans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Additionally,\ncertain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees,\nIRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others.\nThe Corporation plans to enhance its community banking business by moderately increasing its total assets, focusing on\nexpanding single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, and commercial business loans. Additionally, the\nCorporation aims to reduce the percentage of retail time deposits in its deposit base while increasing the proportion of lower-\ncost checking and savings accounts. To diversify its deposit instruments, the Corporation will consider utilizing brokered\ncertificates of deposit and the State of California’s time deposits, subject to market conditions and its funding\n53\nTable of Contents\nneeds. This strategy is designed to improve core revenue by achieving a higher net interest margin and, combined with the\nCorporation’s growth, ultimately increase net interest income. While the Corporation’s long-term strategy targets moderate\ngrowth, management acknowledges that this growth may be influenced by general economic conditions and other factors.\nInvestment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds\nto the Bank’s depositors. Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue.\nPFC performs trustee services for the Bank’s real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the\nfuture hold, real estate for investment.\nThere are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the\nCorporation’s control, including: changes in accounting principles, laws, regulation, interest rates and the economy, among\nothers. The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk\nmanagement, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. The California economic\nenvironment presents heightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies.\nSince the majority of the Corporation’s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the\nvalue of California real estate may also inhibit the Corporation’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying\nreal estate. For further details on risk factors and uncertainties, see “Safe-Harbor Statement” included above in this Item 7, and\nItem 1A, \"Risk Factors.”\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 and 2023\nTotal assets decreased $60.7 million, or 5%, to $1.27 billion at June 30, 2024 from $1.33 billion at June 30, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to decreases in loans held for investment, investment securities and cash and cash\nequivalents.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the FRB of San Francisco, decreased $14.4 million, or\n22%, to $51.4 million at June 30, 2024 from $65.8 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease was consistent with the\nCorporation’s strategy of adequately managing credit and liquidity risk.\nTotal investment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased $24.6 million, or 16%, to $131.9 million at June\n30, 2024 from $156.5 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease was the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments\non investment securities. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank did not purchase or sell any investment securities. For\nadditional information on investment securities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\n8 of this Form 10-K.\nLoans held for investment, net decreased $24.7 million, or 2%, to $1.05 billion at June 30, 2024 from $1.08 billion at June 30,\n2023. In fiscal 2024, the Bank originated $75.5 million of loans held for investment, down 68% from $237.1 million during\nfiscal 2023. In both years these loans consisted primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The\nBank did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2024 or 2023. Management attributes the decrease in loan originations to the higher\ninterest rate environment and overall uncertainty in the economy. Total loan principal payments in fiscal 2024 were $99.9\nmillion, down 2% from $102.3 million in fiscal 2023. There was no REO in both fiscal 2024 and 2023. The balance of multi-\nfamily, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans, net of undisbursed loan funds, decreased $22.6\nmillion, or 4%, to $532.6 million at June 30, 2024 from $555.2 million at June 30, 2023, and represented 51% and 52% of\nloans held for investment, respectively. The balance of single-family loans held for investment decreased slightly to $518.1\nmillion at June 30, 2024, from $518.8 million at June 30, 2023. For additional information on loans held for investment, see\nNote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFHLB – San Francisco and other equity investments increased $603,000, or 6%, to $10.1 million at June 30, 2024 from $9.5\nmillion at June 30, 2023. The increase was due to a VISA stock conversion and the purchase of additional FHLB stock. In\nMay 2024, the Bank converted its Class B1 VISA stock to Class B2 VISA stock and Class C VISA stock. Subsequently, the\nBank recorded the Class C VISA stock at its fair value on its Consolidated Statements of Condition. As\n54\nTable of Contents\nof June 30, 2024, the fair value of the Class C VISA stock was $540,000. The Bank also purchased $63,000 of required\nadditional FHLB - San Francisco stock during the year.\nTotal deposits decreased $62.3 million, or 7%, to $888.3 million at June 30, 2024 from $950.6 million at June 30, 2023.\nTransaction accounts decreased $115.1 million, or 16%, to $614.5 million at June 30, 2024 from $729.6 million at June 30,\n2023, while time deposits increased $53.0 million, or 24%, to $273.9 million at June 30, 2024 from $220.9 million at June 30,\n2023. The increase in time deposits includes the increased utilization of brokered certificates of deposit. Brokered certificates\nof deposit increased $25.4 million, or 24%, to $131.8 million at June 30, 2024 from $106.4 million at June 30, 2023. As of\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, the percentage of transaction accounts to total deposits was 69% and 77%, respectively. Total retail\ndeposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit, decreased by $87.7 million, or 10% to $756.5\nmillion at June 30, 2024 from $844.2 million at June 30, 2023, due primarily to the decline of transaction account balances\nrelated to some customers seeking higher interest rates elsewhere. For additional information on deposits, see Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nBorrowings, consisting of FHLB – San Francisco advances increased $3.5 million, or 1%, to $238.5 million at June 30, 2024\nfrom $235.0 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to new advances to augment the decrease in deposits.\nThe weighted average maturity of the Corporation’s FHLB – San Francisco advances was approximately 13 months at June\n30, 2024, up from 12 months at June 30, 2023. For additional information on borrowings, see Note 7 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTotal stockholders’ equity increased slightly to $129.9 million at June 30, 2024 from $129.7 million at June 30, 2023,\nprimarily as a result of net income and the amortization of stock-based compensation in fiscal 2024, partly offset by stock\nrepurchases (see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases\nof Equity Securities” of this Form 10-K) and quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral. The Corporation recorded net income of $7.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024, down $1.2 million, or 14%, from $8.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily attributable to a $2.1 million decrease in net interest income, a $270,000 increase in non-\ninterest expense and a $134,000 decrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a $437,000 change in the provision for credit\nlosses resulting from a $63,000 recovery of credit losses recorded during fiscal 2024 compared to a $374,000 provision for\ncredit losses during fiscal 2023. The Corporation's efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net\ninterest income and non-interest income, increased to 73% in fiscal 2024 from 69% in fiscal 2023 due to both an increase in\nnon-interest expenses and a decline in revenues. Return on average assets in fiscal 2024 decreased to 0.57% from 0.68% in\nfiscal 2023 and return on average stockholders' equity in fiscal 2024 decreased to 5.62% from 6.58% in fiscal 2023.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $2.1 million, or 6%, to $34.9 million in fiscal 2024 from $37.0 million in\nfiscal 2023. This decrease resulted from interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities increasing at a faster pace than interest\nincome earned on interest-earning assets. Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points to 2.78% in fiscal 2024 from 2.99% in\nfiscal 2023, due to the decline in net interest income coupled with an increase in average interest earning assets. The average\nbalance of interest-earning assets increased $18.6 million, or 2%, to $1.25 billion in fiscal 2024 from $1.24 billion in fiscal\n2023. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $16.8 million, or 2%, to $1.13 billion during fiscal 2024 as\ncompared to $1.12 billion during fiscal 2023.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $8.7 million, or 19%, to $54.7 million for fiscal 2024 from $46.0 million for\nfiscal 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of interest income from loans receivable.\nInterest income on loans receivable increased $8.0 million, or 19%, to $50.2 million in fiscal 2024 from $42.2 million in fiscal\n2023. The increase was attributable to a higher average loan yield and, to a lesser extent, a higher average loan balance. The\nweighted average loan yield during fiscal 2024 increased 59 basis points to 4.69% from 4.10% in fiscal 2023,\nreflecting new loans being originated at higher interest rates and adjustable rate loans repricing higher due to overall higher\nmarket interest rates resulting from the FOMC increases in the targeted federal funds rate during the latter half of fiscal\n55\nTable of Contents\n2023. The average balance of loans receivable increased $40.6 million, or 4%, to $1.07 billion during fiscal 2024 from $1.03\nbillion during fiscal 2023.\nInterest income on investment securities decreased $109,000, or 5%, to $2.1 million in fiscal 2024 from $2.2 million in fiscal\n2023, due to a decrease in the average balance, partly offset by an increase in the average yield.. The average balance of\ninvestment securities decreased $27.5 million, or 16%, to $144.5 million in fiscal 2024 from $172.0 million in fiscal 2023 as a\nresult of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on investment\nsecurities increased 17 basis points to 1.43% for fiscal 2024 from 1.26% for fiscal 2023. The increase in the average yield of\ninvestment securities was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization resulting from lower principal payments.\nTotal premium amortization in fiscal 2024 was $532,000, down $259,000, or 33%, from $791,000 in fiscal 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Bank received $802,000 of cash dividends from the FHLB - San Francisco and other equity\ninvestments, an increase of $246,000 or 44% from the $556,000 of cash dividends received in fiscal 2023, resulting in an\naverage yield of 8.35% during fiscal 2024 compared to 6.55% during fiscal 2023.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the FRB of San Francisco, increased $598,000, or\n56%, to $1.7 million in fiscal 2024 from $1.1 million in fiscal 2023, due to a higher average yield and, to a lesser extent, a\nhigher average balance. The average yield increased 133 basis points to 5.38% in fiscal 2024 from 4.05% in fiscal 2023,\nresulting from increases in the targeted federal funds interest rate since March 2022 to July 2023. The average balance of\ninterest-earning deposits increased $4.4 million, or 17%, to $30.6 million in fiscal 2024 from $26.2 million in fiscal 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense for fiscal 2024 was $19.8 million compared to $9.0 million for fiscal 2023, an\nincrease of $10.8 million or 120%. This increase was primarily attributable to a higher interest expense on deposits,\nparticularly time deposits and, to a lesser extent, a higher interest expense on borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing\nliabilities was 1.74% during fiscal 2024, up 94 basis points from 0.80% during fiscal 2023, and the average balance of\ninterest-bearing liabilities was $1.14 billion during fiscal 2024, up $16.8 million or 2% from $1.12 billion during fiscal 2023.\nInterest expense on deposits for fiscal 2024 was $9.7 million compared to $3.1 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $6.6\nmillion or 213%. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average cost for time deposits and, to a lesser extent, a\nhigher average balance of such deposit. The average cost of time deposits in fiscal 2024 was 3.66%, up 196 basis points, from\n1.70% in fiscal 2023, while the average cost of transaction accounts was 0.09% in fiscal 2024, up four basis points from\n0.05% in fiscal 2023. The average cost of all deposits increased 73 basis points to 1.06% in fiscal 2024 from 0.33% in fiscal\n2023. The average balance of time deposits increased $85.8 million, or 53%, to $247.9 million in fiscal 2024 from $162.1\nmillion in fiscal 2023, which as partly offset a decrease in the average balance of transaction accounts which decreased $130.5\nmillion, or 16%, to $668 2 million in fiscal 2024 from $798.7 million in fiscal 2023. The increase of time deposits included\nincreased brokered certificates of deposit. The average balance of brokered certificates of deposit in fiscal 2024 was $118.8\nmillion with the average cost of 5.17% compared to the average balance of $48.7 million with the average cost of 3.97% in\nfiscal 2023.\nInterest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB - San Francisco advances, for fiscal 2024 increased $4.2 million, or 71%,\nto $10.1 million as compared to $5.9 million in fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was due to a\nhigher average balance and, to a lesser extent, a higher average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased $61.7\nmillion, or 39%, to $221.4 million during fiscal 2024 from $159.7 million during fiscal 2023 and the average cost of\nborrowings was 4.58% in fiscal 2024, up 91 basis points from 3.67% in fiscal 2023.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses. During fiscal 2024, the Corporation recorded a recovery of credit losses of\n$63,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of $374,000 during fiscal 2023. The recovery of credit losses reflected in\nfiscal 2024 was primarily due to a $23.5 million decrease in loans held for investment at June 30, 2024 from June 30, 2023\nand a slightly shorter estimated life of the single-family loan portfolio resulting from higher loan prepayment estimates, partly\noffset by higher unfunded loan commitments resulting from a higher outstanding balance at June 30, 2024 as compared to the\nprior fiscal year end. The provision for credit losses in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a higher outstanding balance of loans\nheld for investment.\n56\nTable of Contents\nAt June 30, 2024, the ACL on loans held for investment was $7.1 million, comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of\n$7.1 million and individually evaluated allowances of $37,000; up 20% from $5.9 million at June 30, 2023. The ACL on loans\nas a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 0.67% at June 30, 2024, compared to 0.55% at June 30, 2023. The\nincrease in the ACL on loans was due primarily to the adoption of the CECL methodology ($1.2 million), partly offset by the\nrecovery of credit losses in fiscal 2024 ($63,000, net of a $15,000 provision for unfunded loan commitment reserves). The\nACL on loans as a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 0.67% at June 30, 2024, compared to 0.55% at June 30,\n2023.\nThe following chart quantifies the factors contributing to the changes in the ACL on loans held for investment (“LHFI”) for\nthe year ended June 30, 2024 subsequent to the adoption of the CECL methodology on July 1, 2023.\nManagement believes, based on currently available information, the ACL is sufficient to absorb expected losses inherent in\nloans held for investment at June 30, 2024 under the CECL methodology adopted since July 1, 2023. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1, “Business - “Asset Quality” in this Form 10-K.\nNon-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was $3.9 million in fiscal 2024, a decrease of $134,000 or 3% from $4.1\nmillion in fiscal 2023.\nLoan servicing and other fees decreased $77,000, or 19%, to $337,000 for fiscal 2024 from $414,000 in fiscal 2023, due\nprimarily to lower loan prepayment fees, attributable to lower loan payoffs.\nDeposit account fees decreased $142,000, or 11%, to $1.2 million for fiscal 2024 from $1.3 million in fiscal 2023, due\nprimarily to lower non-sufficient funds account fees, attributable to lower transactions and lower transaction account balances.\nCard and processing fees decreased $141,000, or 9%, to $1.4 million for fiscal 2024 from $1.5 million in fiscal 2023, due\nprimarily to lower debit card transactions.\nOther fees increased $226,000, or 27%, to $1.1 million for fiscal 2024 from $840,000 in fiscal 2023, due primarily to a\n$540,000 net unrealized gain on other equity investments resulting from the VISA share conversion, partly offset by a net\nchange of $190,000 on the losses on sale of loans (a net loss of $64,000 on sale of loans in fiscal 2024 compared to a net gain\nof $124,000 on sale of loans in the prior fiscal year). In May 2024, the Bank converted its VISA Class B1 shares into VISA\nClass B2 shares and VISA Class C shares and recorded the VISA Class C shares at fair value subsequent to the conversion.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNon-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense was $28.5 million in fiscal 2024, an increase of $270,000 or 1% from\n$28.3 million in fiscal 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in premises and\noccupancy expenses, equipment expense, deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments, partly offset by decreases\nin salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased $95,000, or 1%, to $17.6 million in fiscal 2024 from $17.7 million in fiscal\n2023. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in incentive\ncompensation, partly offset by increases in the supplemental executive retirement plans and compensation costs.\nPremises and occupancy expense increased $139,000, or 4%, to $3.6 million in fiscal 2024 from $3.4 million in fiscal 2023.\nThe increase was primarily attributable to increases in building maintenance and fixture depreciation costs, resulting primarily\nfrom the relocation of one of our banking offices and ATM upgrades, partly offset by lower on-line service expenses.\nEquipment expense increased $157,000, or 14%, to $1.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $1.2 million in fiscal 2023, due primarily\nto the upgrades of computer hardware and software and an increase of equipment lease expenses.\nDeposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments increased $123,000, or 19%, to $780,000 in fiscal 2024 from\n$657,000 in fiscal 2023, primarily attributable to the increase in FDIC insurance assessments.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income\ntax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences\nbetween income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and bank-owned\nlife insurance policies, among others. Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period\nbased on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax.\nThe provision for income taxes was $3.0 million for fiscal 2024, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%, down $788,000\nor 21% from $3.8 million in fiscal 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 30.8%. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2024\nwas attributable primarily to the decreased tax benefit in fiscal 2023 from the equity incentive awards with the share price\nlower at vesting and distribution than the fair value estimated at the grant date, which was not replicated in fiscal 2024.\nThe Corporation’s effective tax rate may differ from the estimated tax rates described above due to discrete items such as\nfurther adjustments to net deferred tax assets, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings\nfrom bank owned life insurance, among other items. The Corporation determined that the above tax rates meet its estimated\nincome tax obligations. For additional information, see Note 8, \"Income Taxes,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Costs\nThe following table sets forth certain information for the periods regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as\nthe total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-\nbearing liabilities and average yields and costs thereof. Yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing\nincome or expense by the average monthly balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented.\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage Yield/ Average Yield/\n(Dollars In Thousands) Balance Interest Cost Balance Interest Cost\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans receivable, net(1) $ 1,069,616 $ 50,194 4.69% $ 1,029,000 $ 42,191 4.10%\nInvestment securities 144,466 2,060 1.43% 172,005 2,169 1.26%\nFHLB - San Francisco and other equity\ninvestments 9,601 802 8.35% 8,488 556 6.55%\nInterest-earning deposits 30,610 1,674 5.38% 26,214 1,076 4.05%\nTotal interest-earning assets 1,254,293 54,730 4.36% 1,235,707 45,992 3.72%\nNoninterest-earning assets 30,655 32,763\nTotal assets $ 1,284,948 $ 1,268,470\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nChecking and money market accounts(2) $ 407,938 290 0.07% $ 479,921 227 0.05%\nSavings accounts 260,249 313 0.12% 318,795 168 0.05%\nTime deposits 247,863 9,063 3.66% 162,144 2,751 1.70%\nTotal deposits(3) 916,050 9,666 1.06% 960,860 3,146 0.33%\nBorrowings 221,368 10,141 4.58% 159,742 5,861 3.67%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 1,137,418 19,807 1.74% 1,120,602 9,007 0.80%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities 16,731 17,307\nTotal liabilities 1,154,149 1,137,909\nStockholders’ equity 130,799 130,561\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 1,284,948 $ 1,268,470\nNet interest income $ 34,923 $ 36,985\nInterest rate spread(4) 2.62% 2.92%\nNet interest margin(5) 2.78% 2.99%\nRatio of average interest- earning assets to\naverage interest-bearing liabilities 110.28% 110.27%\n(1) Includes the average balance of non-performing loans of $2.1 million and $1.1 million, as well as net deferred loan costs of\n$955 thousand and $959 thousand for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Includes the average balance of noninterest-bearing checking accounts of $97.3 million and $112.9 million in the fiscal\nyears ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(3) Includes the average balance of uninsured deposits of $135.7 million and $170.2 million in the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(4) Represents the difference between the weighted average yield on all interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate\non all interest-bearing liabilities.\n(5) Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRate/Volume Variance\nThe following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on interest income and expense of the Corporation for\nthe period presented.

For purposes of calculating volume, rate and rate/volume variances, non-performing\nloans were included in the weighted average balance outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Bank’s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the\nmaturity and sale of investment securities, proceeds from FHLB - San Francisco advances, access to the discount window\nfacility at the FRB of San Francisco and access to the correspondent bank’s federal funds facility. While maturities and\nscheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and\nmortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.\nThe primary investing activity of the Bank has been the origination and, to a lesser extent, purchase of loans held for\ninvestment. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank originated loans held for investment of $75.5\nmillion and $237.1 million, respectively. The Bank did not purchase any loans held for investment from other financial\ninstitutions in fiscal 2024 or 2023. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had loan origination commitments totaling $9.4\nmillion and $2.4 million, with undisbursed loan funds of $435,000 and $2.0 million, respectively. The Bank anticipates that it\nwill have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments.\nThe Bank's primary financing activity is gathering deposits, which include both retail and brokered deposits. During the fiscal\nyears ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the net decrease in deposits was $62.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively. On June\n30, 2024, time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less were $245.7 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to\nretain a significant percentage of its time deposits as they mature by adjusting deposit rates based upon the current interest rate\nenvironment.\nThe Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and\ndeposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Bank generally\nmaintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At June 30, 2024, total cash and cash\nequivalents were $51.4 million, or 4.0% of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products\nand FHLB - San Francisco advances, the Bank may continue to rely on FHLB - San Francisco advances for part\n60\nTable of Contents\nof its liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2024, the remaining financing availability at the FHLB - San Francisco was $261.3\nmillion and the remaining available collateral was $367.4 million. In addition, the Bank has secured a $208.6 million discount\nwindow facility at the FRB of San Francisco, collateralized by $126.6 million of investment securities and $178.6 million of\nloans held for investment. The Bank also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million which\nmatures on June 30, 2025. As of June 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or\nthe federal funds facility with its correspondent bank. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totals\napproximately $519.9 million at June 30, 2024.\nRegulations require the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank's average liquidity\nratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended June\n30, 2024 decreased to 16.6% from 18.1% during the same quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the liquidity ratio was\ndue primarily to the decrease in average qualifying liquid assets which exceeded the decrease in average deposits and\nborrowings during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 in comparison to the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The Bank augments its\nliquidity by maintaining sufficient borrowing capacity at the FHLB - San Francisco, FRB of San Francisco and its\ncorrespondent bank.\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our\ntechnology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate\ncapital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on\nrevenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The\namount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and\nproducts, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2025 we project expenditures of ranging from $270,000 to\n$1.5 million for capital investment in premises and equipment. For additional information regarding our commitments, see\nNote 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K.\nProvident is a separate legal entity from the Bank and, on a stand-alone level, must provide for its own liquidity and pay its\nown operating expenses, cash dividends and stock repurchases. Provident’s primary sources of funds consist of capital raised\nthrough dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank\nto pay dividends. During fiscal 2024, the Corporation purchased 197,349 shares of the Corporation’s common stock with a\nweighted average cost of $13.05 per share. As of June 30, 2024, there are 189,116 shares available for purchase under the\nCorporation’s existing stock repurchase plan. The Corporation purchases the shares from time to time in the open market or\nthrough privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and\navailable cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. In addition, we currently\nexpect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of\nDirectors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current\nquarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.14 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a\ndividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and\nreturning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal 2025 at this rate of\n$0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $959,000 based on the number of our\ncurrent outstanding shares as of June 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, Provident (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of\napproximately $3.4 million.\nThe Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the\nOCC. Under the OCC's capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. In addition, Provident Financial\nHoldings, Inc., as a savings and loan holding company registered with the FRB, is required by the FRB to maintain capital\nadequacy that generally parallels the OCC requirements. Since the holding company has less than $3.0 billion in assets, the\ncapital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the FRB expects the holding company’s subsidiary bank to be well\ncapitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Under the prompt corrective action provisions,\nminimum ratios of 5.0% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital, 6.5% for CET1 Capital, 8.0% for Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and 10.0%\nfor Total Risk-based Capital are required to be deemed “well capitalized.” As of June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the capital\nratios needed to be considered well capitalized with Tier 1 Leverage Capital, CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and\nTotal Risk-based Capital ratios of 10.0%, 19.3%, 19.3% and 20.4%, respectively. See also, “Regulation – Federal Regulation\nof Savings Institutions – Capital Requirements” and Note 9, \"Capital\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontained in Items 1 and 8 of this Form 10-K, respectively.\nImpact of New Accounting Pronouncements\nVarious elements of the Corporation's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques,\nvaluation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies\nthat, as a result of the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are important to gain an understanding\nof the financial statements of the Corporation. These policies relate to the methodology for the recognition of interest income,\ndetermination of the provision for credit losses and the ACL, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments, the\nvaluation of mortgage servicing assets and real estate owned and the provision for income taxes. These policies and\njudgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in this Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in the section entitled “Organization and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial\nstatements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time. However, because of the sensitivity of the financial\nstatements to these accounting policies, changes to the judgments, estimates and assumptions used could result in material\ndifferences in the results of operations or financial condition.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nQuantitative Aspects of Market Risk. The Corporation does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial\ninstrument nor does it purchase high-risk derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Corporation is not subject to\nforeign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. The primary market risk that the Corporation faces is interest rate\nrisk. For information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the Corporation's interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities, see “Interest Rate Risk” below and Item 1, “Business - Lending Activities - Maturity of Loans Held for\nInvestment,” “- Investment Securities Activities,” and “- Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Time Deposits by\nRemaining Maturity” in this Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk. One of the Corporation's principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing\nits exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The Corporation, through the Corporation's Asset-Liability Committee, has sought to\nreduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the\ninterest rate sensitivity of the Corporation's interest-earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with\ninterest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions. In addition, the Corporation maintains an investment\nportfolio, which is largely comprised of U.S. government agency MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and\nCMO with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently or have a relatively short-average life. The\nCorporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing brokered certificates of deposit and FHLB -\nSan Francisco advances as secondary sources of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered certificates of\ndeposit, reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part\nof its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to\nseven years. For additional information, see Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” in this Form 10-K.\nThrough the use of an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by\nmeasuring the change in net portfolio value (“NPV”) over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present\nvalue of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The calculation is intended to\nillustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -300, -\n62\nTable of Contents\n200, -100, +100, +200 and +300 basis points (“bp”) with no effect given to steps that management might take to counter the\neffect of the interest rate movement. As of June 30, 2024, the targeted federal funds rate range was 5.25% to 5.50%.\nThe following table sets forth as of June 30, 2024 the estimated changes in NPV based on the indicated interest rate\nenvironment (dollars in thousands):\nNet Portfolio NPV as Percentage\nBasis Points (\"bp\") Portfolio NPV Value of of Portfolio Value Sensitivity\nChange in Rates Value Change(1) Assets Assets(2) Measure(3)\n+300 bp $ 99,797 $ (29,127) $ 1,233,560 8.09 % (203)bp\n+200 bp $ 114,840 $ (14,084) $ 1,252,262 9.17 % (95)bp\n+100 bp $ 124,386 $ (4,538) $ 1,265,538 9.83 % (29)bp\n- $ 128,924 $ — $ 1,273,858 10.12 % —\n-100 bp $ 136,297 $ 7,373 $ 1,285,088 10.61 % 49 bp\n-200 bp $ 128,436 $ (488) $ 1,281,017 10.03 % (9)bp\n-300 bp $ 129,438 $ 514 $ 1,286,155 10.06 % (6)bp\n(1) Represents the (decrease) increase of the NPV at the indicated interest rate change in comparison to the NPV at June 30,\n2024 (“base case”).\n(2) Calculated as the NPV divided by the portfolio value of total assets.\n(3) Calculated as the change in the NPV ratio (NPV as a Percentage of Portfolio Value Assets) from the base case amount\nassuming the indicated change in interest rates (expressed in basis points).\nThe following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a +200 bp rate\nshock at June 30, 2024 and -200 bp rate shock at June 30, 2023 which has been determined to be the most detrimental to the\ninterest rate risk of the Corporation in a -200, -100, +100 and +200 bp rate shock scenario:\nAt June 30, 2024 At June 30, 2023\n(+200 bp rate shock) (-200 bp rate shock)\nPre-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets 10.12 % 9.29 %\nPost-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets 9.17 % 8.37 %\nSensitivity Measure: Change in NPV Ratio -95 bp -92 bp\nThe pre-shock NPV ratio increased 83 basis points to 10.12% at June 30, 2024 from 9.29% at June 30, 2023, and the post-\nshock NPV ratio increased 80 basis points to 9.17% (+200 basis point rate shock) at June 30, 2024 from 8.37% (-200 basis\npoint rate shock) at June 30, 2023. The increase of the NPV ratios was primarily attributable to the net income in fiscal 2024\nand amortization of stock-based compensation, partly offset by a $7.0 million cash dividend distribution from the Bank to the\nCorporation in September 2023, an $824,000 CECL adoption charged to equity, and increases in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity measure increased to 95 basis points at June 30, 2024 from 92 basis points at June 30, 2023.\nAs with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in\nthe foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing,\nthey may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and\nliabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and\nliabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that\nrestrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest\nrates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from\nthose assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate\nincrease, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and\ndefaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in\nthe event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair\nmarket value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the\nevent of the liquidation of the Corporation.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity\n\"gap\" analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest\nrates. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual repricing or scheduled\nmaturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits) that have no contractual maturity, the table\npresents estimated principal cash flows and, as applicable, the Corporation's historical experience, management's judgment\nand statistical analysis concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors.\nThe following table represents the interest rate gap analysis of the Corporation's assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2024:\nTerm to Contractual Repricing, Estimated Repricing, or Contractual\nMaturity(1)\nAs of June 30, 2024\nGreater than Greater than Greater than\n12 months or 1 year to 3 3 years to 5 years or\n(Dollars In Thousands) less years 5 years non-sensitive Total\nRepricing Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 45,058 $ — $ — $ 6,318 $ 51,376\nInvestment securities 7,176 — — 124,724 131,900\nLoans held for investment 273,678 199,276 245,557 334,468 1,052,979\nFHLB - San Francisco and other\nequity investments 10,108 — — — 10,108\nOther assets 4,287 — — 21,550 25,837\nTotal assets 340,307 199,276 245,557 487,060 1,272,200\nRepricing Liabilities and Equity:\nChecking deposits - noninterest-\nbearing — — — 95,627 95,627\nChecking deposits - interest\nbearing 38,194 76,387 76,387 63,656 254,624\nSavings deposits 47,776 95,551 95,551 — 238,878\nMoney market deposits 12,662 12,662 — — 25,324\nTime deposits 245,713 23,383 3,545 1,254 273,895\nBorrowings 145,500 78,000 15,000 — 238,500\nOther liabilities 1,783 — — 13,628 15,411\nStockholders' equity — — — 129,941 129,941\nTotal liabilities and\nstockholders' equity 491,628 285,983 190,483 304,106 1,272,200\nRepricing gap positive (negative) $ (151,321) $ (86,707) $ 55,074 $ 182,954 $ —\nCumulative repricing gap:\nDollar amount $ (151,321) $ (238,028) $ (182,954) $ — $ —\nPercent of total assets (12)% (19)% (14)% — % — %\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents are presented as estimated repricing; investment securities and loans held for investment are presented as\ncontractual maturities or contractual repricing (without consideration for prepayments); FHLB - San Francisco and other equity\ninvestments are presented as contractual repricing; transaction accounts (checking, savings and money market deposits) are presented\nas estimated repricing; and time deposits (without consideration for early withdrawals) and borrowings are presented as contractual\nmaturities.\nThe static gap analysis under “12 months or less” duration, “Greater than 1 year to 3 years” duration and “Greater than 3 years\nto 5 years” duration show negative positions in the \"Cumulative repricing gap - dollar amount\" category, indicating more\nliabilities are sensitive to repricing than assets in the short and intermediate terms. Management views noninterest-bearing\ndeposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term\nfunding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity\n64\nTable of Contents\nfor savings and money market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances\nare assumed to be subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15% per year, savings\ndeposits at 20% per year and money market deposits at 50% in the first and second years.\nThe gap results presented above could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from\nthe assumptions used in the preparation of the gap analysis. Furthermore, the gap analysis provides a static view of interest\nrate risk exposure at a specific point in time without taking into account redirection of cash flows activity and deposit\nfluctuations.\nThe extent to which the net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of\nfactors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not\nuncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in the market rates of interest. Additionally,\nprepayments of loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the\nrelationship between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the previous table, is only a general\nindicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income. Results are likely to be\ndifferent from that predicted solely on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the previous table.\nThe Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end\nassuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items:\n● The Corporation’s current balance sheet and repricing characteristics;\n● Forecasted balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan;\n● Current interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates;\n● Embedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps;\n● Repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments;\n● Loan, investment security, deposit and borrowing cash flows;\n● Loan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; and\n● Immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of +300, +200 +100, and -100, -200 and -300 bp.\nThe following table describes the results of the analysis at June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAt June 30, 2024 At June 30, 2023\nBasis Point (bp) Change in Basis Point (bp) Change in\nChange in Rates Net Interest Income Change in Rates Net Interest Income\n+300 bp -8.12% +300 bp -10.56%\n+200 bp -3.45% +200 bp -5.26%\n+100 bp -0.51% +100 bp -1.95%\n-100 bp -0.67% -100 bp 1.25%\n-200 bp -1.15% -200 bp -0.59%\n-300 bp -1.86% -300 bp -3.33%\nAt June 30, 2024, the Corporation was close to neutral with regard to the sensitivity of net interest income as projected net\ninterest income declines slightly under rising or declining interest rates during the subsequent 12-month period.\nAt June 30, 2023, the Corporation was liability sensitive as its interest-bearing liabilities are expected to reprice more quickly\nthan its interest-earning assets during the subsequent 12-month period. Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the\nmodel projects a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. In a falling interest rate environment,\nthe results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period at the -100 basis point scenario and\na decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period for the -200 and -300 basis point scenarios.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable.\nHowever, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not\n65\nTable of Contents\nnecessarily occur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in\ninterest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete\nthe analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore, the model\nresults that the Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the\nCorporation’s current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the\ntreasury yield curve.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\na) An evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the\nCorporation’s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer)\nand the Corporation’s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and\nevaluating the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control\nprocedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,\nwithin the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls\nand procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about\nthe likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals\nunder all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024 are effective, at\nthe reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports\nit files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management (including the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nb) There have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of\nthe Act) that occurred during the quarter year ended June 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its\ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure\nare met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent\nlimitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because\nof simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also\nbased in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance\n66\nTable of Contents\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThis management report includes the subsidiary institution of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the \"Corporation\"),\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B. which is subject to Part 363 in the statement of management's responsibilities; the report on\nmanagement's assessment of compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and,\nif applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; and the report on management's assessment of\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nManagement of the Corporation is responsible for preparing the Corporation’s annual consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles; for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control\nstructure and procedures for financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in\naccordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR\nY-9SP); and for complying with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable,\nState laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions. The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nTo comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Corporation designed and\nimplemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across\nthe enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission. Management's assessment of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was also\nconducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act\n(FDICIA), which include controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in\naccordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR\nY-9SP).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls, a\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, the Corporation's internal control\nover financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in accordance with the\ninstructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP), is effective\nbased on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nManagement of the Corporation has assessed the Corporation's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to\ninsider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions during the fiscal\nyear ended on June 30, 2024. Management has concluded that the Corporation complied with the Federal laws and regulations\npertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions\nduring the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2024.\n67\nTable of Contents\nDate: August 30, 2024\n/s/ Donavon P.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Corporation as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCorporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud. The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses related to Qualitative Factors for Single Family Mortgage, Multifamily Mortgage, and\nCommercial Real Estate - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nManagement estimates the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) Management calculates the quantitative portion\nof the collectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an average charge-off methodology. The Corporation\nprimarily utilizes historical loss rates for the ACL based on its own specific historical losses and/or with peer loss history\nwhere applicable. Management considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loans may\nbe warranted, given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe qualitative portion of the Corporation’s allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using management\njudgment, to determine risk categorizations in each of the qualitative factors. The amount of qualitative allowance is also\ncontingent upon the relative weighting of the qualitative factors according to management’s judgment.\nAuditing the collectively evaluated loans of the Corporation’s ACL, specifically management’s qualitative loss factors for\ncertain single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans, involved significant judgment. Given the management\njudgments required for the determination of risk categorization and relative weighting of qualitative factors, performing audit\nprocedures to evaluate the Qualitative Factors in the ACL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent\nof effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the ACL included the following, among others:\n● We performed inquiries and examined documentation to understand management’s methodology and process in\ndetermining the qualitative factors in the ACL, including the key assumptions and relevant data utilized.\n● We involved our credit specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the\nqualitative and methodologies applied by management.\n● We tested the design and implementation of controls over the (i) selection of the risk categorizations and relative\nweighting in each of the qualitative factors used as an input to the model and (ii) overall calculation and disclosure.\n● We evaluated the reasonableness of the ACL inputs, including management’s judgments and assumptions used in the\ndevelopment of the qualitative factors, including the directional consistency and magnitude of the qualitative factors\napplied, and the reasonableness of the period selected for the forecast and the associated economic factors identified\nby management.\n● We compared the Corporation’s ACL with benchmark data obtained independently to assess whether the ACL is\nwithin a reasonable range for specific loan categories.\n/s/Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCosta Mesa, California\nAugust 30, 2024\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 2001.\n77\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nJune 30, June 30,\n(In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Information) 2024 2023\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 51,376 $ 65,849\nInvestment securities -

(collectively, the “Corporation”). All inter-company balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the “Bank”) converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally\nchartered stock savings bank effective June 27, 1996. Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized by\nthe Bank, acquired all of the capital stock of the Bank issued in the conversion; the transaction was recorded on a book value\nbasis.\nThe Corporation has determined that it operates in one business segment through the Bank. The Bank's activities include\nattracting deposits, offering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real\nestate, construction and other mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business and consumer loans held for\ninvestment. Deposits are collected primarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in\nCalifornia. Additional activities may include originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first mortgages.\nLoans are primarily originated and purchased in California.\nUse of estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly\nsusceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of\ninvestment securities, the valuation of loans held for investment at fair value, deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets,\nreal estate owned and deferred compensation costs.\nThe following accounting policies, together with those disclosed elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements, represent\nthe significant accounting policies of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and the Bank.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and due from banks, as well as overnight deposits placed at the FRB – San\nFrancisco and correspondent banks.\nInvestment securities\nThe Corporation classifies its qualifying investments as available for sale or held to maturity. The Corporation classifies\ninvestments as held to maturity when it has the ability and it is management’s positive intent to hold such securities to\nmaturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost. All other securities are classified as available for\nsale and are carried at fair value. Fair value generally is determined based upon quoted market prices. Changes in net\nunrealized gains (losses) on debt securities available for sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of\ntax. Gains and losses on sale or dispositions of investment securities are included in non-interest income and are determined\nusing the specific identification method. Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized over the expected average life of the\nsecurities using the effective interest method.\nThe Corporation evaluates individual investment securities quarterly for impairment based on Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,” which was adopted on July 1, 2023. The Corporation\ndoes not currently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale and as such,\nrecords the investment security at book value or fair market value as prescribed by GAAP. As a part of the Corporation’s\nmonthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than\nnot that the Bank will be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized costs basis. These\nliquidity scenarios support the Corporation’s assessment that the Corporation has the ability to hold these held to maturity\nsecurities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs is realized and it is not more likely\nthan not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized costs.\n83\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoans held for investment\nLoans held for investment consist of long-term single-family adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by single-family\nresidences and multi-family and commercial real estate loans secured by commercial property, land and other residential\nproperties, which the Corporation intends to hold for the foreseeable future. These loans are generally offered to customers\nand businesses located in California.\nNet loan origination fees and certain direct origination expenses are deferred and amortized to interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. Amortization is discontinued for non-performing loans. Interest\nreceivable represents primarily the current month’s interest, which will be included as a part of the borrower’s next monthly\nloan payment. Interest receivable is accrued only if deemed collectible. Loans are placed on non-performing status when they\nbecome 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on non-performing status, interest accrued but not received is reversed\nagainst interest income. Interest income on non-performing loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is\nreceived and the principal balance is deemed collectible. If the principal balance is not deemed collectible, the entire payment\nreceived (principal and interest) is applied to the outstanding loan balance. Non-performing loans that become current as to\nboth principal and interest are returned to accrual status after demonstrating satisfactory payment history (usually six\nconsecutive months) and when future payments are expected to be collectible.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management, which has a material impact\non the carrying value of financial assets. The Corporation adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for all\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning\nafter July 1, 2023 are presented under CECL while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously\napplicable accounting standards.\nNon-performing loans\nThe Corporation assesses loans individually and classifies them as non-performing when the accrual of interest has been\ndiscontinued, loans have been modified or management has serious doubts about the future collectability of principal and\ninterest, even though the loans may currently be performing. Factors considered in determining classification include, but are\nnot limited to, expected future cash flows, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The\nCorporation measures each non-performing loan based on ASC 326, establishes a collectively evaluated or individually\nevaluated allowance, and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible. Loans identified to be individually\nevaluated have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the collateral, less selling costs or discounted cash flow\nwith an appropriate default factor.\nReal estate owned\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the fair value of the real estate acquired, less estimated selling\ncosts. Subsequent to foreclosure, the Corporation charges current earnings for estimated losses if the carrying value of the\nproperty exceeds its fair value. Gains or losses on the sale of real estate are recognized upon disposition of the property. Costs\nrelating to improvement, maintenance and repairs of the property are expensed as incurred under gain (loss) on sale and\noperations of real estate owned acquired in the settlement of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Corporation reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets include buildings, land, fixtures, furniture and\nequipment. An asset is considered impaired when the expected discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life are less\nthan the net book value. When impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment loss is the excess of the net\nbook value over its fair value.\n84\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed\nprimarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nBuildings (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)10 to 40 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3 to 10 years\nAutomobiles 3 to 5 years\nComputer equipment 3 to 5 years\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their respective lease terms or the useful life of the improvement,\nwhich ranges from one to 10 years. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred.\nIncome taxes\nThe Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740 requires the affirmative\nevaluation that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a tax position, that an enterprise is entitled to\neconomic benefits resulting from positions taken in income tax returns. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-\nnot recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.\nASC 740 requires that when determining the need for a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, management must\nassess both positive and negative evidence with regard to the realizability of the tax losses represented by that asset. To the\nextent available, if sources of taxable income are insufficient to absorb tax losses, a valuation allowance is necessary. Sources\nof taxable income for this analysis include prior years’ tax returns, the expected reversals of taxable temporary differences\nbetween book and tax income, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, and future taxable income. The deferred income\ntax asset related to the allowance for credit losses will be realized when actual charge-offs are made against the allowance.\nBased on the availability of loss carry-backs and projected taxable income during the periods for which loss carry-forwards\nare available, management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will realize the deferred tax asset. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis for a valuation allowance. The future realization of\nthese tax benefits primarily hinges on adequate future earnings to utilize the tax benefit. Prospective earnings or losses, tax\nlaw changes or capital changes could prompt the Corporation to reevaluate the assumptions which may be used to establish a\nvaluation allowance. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the estimated net deferred tax asset, which is included in prepaid expenses\nand other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, was $606,000 and $218,000, respectively. The\nCorporation maintains net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary tax differences, such as loss reserves, deferred\ncompensation, non-accrued interest and unrealized gains (losses), among other items. The increase in the net deferred tax asset\nresulted primarily from higher loss reserves and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities from lower net deferred loan costs. The\nCorporation did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefit at June 30, 2024 or\n2023.\nBank owned life insurance (\"BOLI\")\nASC 715-60-35, \"Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar\nLife Insurance Arrangements,\" requires an employer to recognize obligations associated with endorsement split-dollar life\ninsurance arrangements that extend into the participant’s post-employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or\nbased on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement. The Corporation adopted\nASC 715-60-35 using the latter option, i.e., based on the future death benefit. The Bank purchases BOLI policies on the lives\nof certain executive officers while they are employed by the Bank and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. The Bank\ninvests in BOLI to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. The Bank\nrecords these BOLI policies within prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at\neach policy’s respective cash surrender value, with net changes recorded in other non-interest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nCash dividend\nA declaration or payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, who take into account the\nCorporation’s financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, economic\nconditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the\nCorporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for\nthe current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared. For additional\n85\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ninformation, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the subsequent event related to the cash\ndividend.\nStock repurchases\nThe Corporation repurchased 197,349 shares of its common stock with an average cost of $13.05 per share during fiscal 2024\npursuant to its publicly announced stock repurchase plans. As of June 30, 2024, a total of 189,116 shares or 54% of the shares\nauthorized for repurchase under the Corporation’s existing stock repurchase plan remain available to purchase until the plan\nexpires on September 28, 2024.\nEarnings per common share (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS represents net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period excluding\nany potential dilutive effects. Diluted EPS gives effect to any potential issuance of common stock that would have caused\nbasic EPS to be lower as if the issuance had already occurred. Accordingly, diluted EPS reflects an increase in the weighted\naverage shares outstanding as a result of the assumed exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. The\ncomputation of diluted EPS does not assume exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock that would have an anti-\ndilutive effect on EPS.\nStock-based compensation\nASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” requires companies to recognize in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.\nStock-based compensation, inclusive of restricted stock expense, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for\nthe fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $240,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\")\nThe Corporation recognizes compensation expense when the Bank contributes funds to the ESOP for the purchase of the\nCorporation’s common stock to be allocated to the ESOP participants. Since the contributions are discretionary, the benefits\npayable under the ESOP cannot be estimated.\nRestricted stock\nThe Corporation recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period of the shares awarded, equal to the fair value of the\nshares at the award date. A total of $203,000 and $1.1 million of restricted stock expense was amortized during fiscal 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nPost-retirement benefits\nThe estimated obligation for post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits is determined based on an actuarial\ncomputation of the cost of current and future benefits for the eligible (grandfathered) retirees and employees. The post\nretirement benefit liability is included in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements\nof Financial Condition. Effective July 1, 2003, the Corporation discontinued the post-retirement health care and life insurance\nbenefits to any employee not previously qualified (grandfathered) for these benefits, unless included within an employment\nagreement. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the accrued liability for post-retirement benefits was $450,000 and $270,000,\nrespectively.\nComprehensive income\nASC 220, “Comprehensive Income,” requires that realized revenues, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income\n(loss). Unrealized gains (losses) on available for sale securities and interest-only strips are reported as a separate component of\nthe stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the change in the unrealized gains\n(losses) are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’\nEquity.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAccounting Standard Updates (“ASU”)\nASU 2023-09:\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public business entities to annually (a) disclose specific\ncategories in the rate reconciliation and (b) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative\nthreshold of equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the\napplicable statutory income tax rate. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the\nimpact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-07:\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments include: (a) introducing a new requirement to disclose\nsignificant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), (b) extending certain\nannual disclosures to interim periods, (c) clarifying that single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety,\n(d) permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and (e) requiring\ndisclosure of the title and position of the CODM. This ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.\nThe Corporation is in the process of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption\nof this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2020-04:\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions\nthat reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or other rate references expected to be discontinued as a result\nof reference rate reform. The ASU permits an entity to make necessary modifications to eligible contracts or transactions\nwithout requiring contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. In January 2021, ASU\n2021-01 clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge\naccounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the changes in the interest rates used for margining, discounting, or\ncontract price alignment for derivative instruments that are being implemented as part of the market-wide transition to new\nreference rates (commonly referred to as the “discounting transition”). In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,\nDeferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The FASB had originally included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on\nexpectations of when the LIBOR would cease being published. In March 2021, it was announced that the intended cessation\ndate of LIBOR was extended to June 30, 2023. As a result, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 deferring the sunset date of Topic\n848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through\nDecember 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation had approximately $469.4 million in loans held for investment with\nLIBOR indices. Beginning July 1, 2023, the Corporation started to transition these loans to Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”) indices or other rate indices in accordance with the government agency guidelines. As of September 30, 2023, all\nloans held for investment with LIBOR indices had been transitioned to SOFR or other rate indices. The Corporation\ndetermined that the impact of the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-13:\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments,” and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance. On July 1, 2023, the Corporation\nadopted this ASU that replaced the incurred loss methodology with the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology.\nCECL requires an estimate of credit losses for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost,\nincluding loans held for investment, held-to-maturity investment securities and some off-balance sheet credit exposures such\nas unfunded commitments to extend credit. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount\nexpected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”).\n87\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn addition, CECL made changes to the accounting for available for sale investment securities. One such change is to require\ncredit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities if management\ndoes not intend to sell and does not believe that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nThe Corporation adopted ASC 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,” and all related subsequent amendments using the\nprospective transition approach for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The\ntransition adjustment of the adoption of CECL included an $1.2 million increase in the ACL, which is presented as a reduction\nto net loans held for investment. The Corporation recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of $824,000 as of July 1, 2023\nfor the cumulative effect of adopting CECL, which reflects the transition adjustments noted above, net of the applicable\ndeferred tax assets recorded. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2023 are presented under CECL while prior\nperiod amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable accounting standards.\nThe Corporation adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-\ntemporary impairment had been recognized prior to July 1, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation did not have any other-\nthan-temporary impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Corporation determined that an\nACL on available for sale securities was not deemed necessary.\nThe following table illustrates the impact on the ACL from the adoption of ASC 326:\nAllowance for Allowance Impact to\ncredit losses before adoption allowance after ASC\nunder ASC 326 of ASC 326 326 adoption\n(In Thousands) (07/01/2023) (06/30/2023) (07/01/2023)\nAssets:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 6,325 $ 1,720 $ 4,605\nMulti-family 656 3,270 (2,614)\nCommercial real estate 82 868 (786)\nConstruction 62 15 47\nOther 5 2 3\nCommercial business loans 13 67 (54)\nConsumer loans — 4 (4)\nACL on loans $ 7,143 $ 5,946 $ 1,197\nLiabilities:\nUnfunded loan commitment reserve $ 42 $ 42 $ —\nIn March 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-02, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures.” This ASU eliminates the concept and treatment of troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) in relation\nto the adoption of the CECL model for the accounting for credit losses (see note above regarding ASU 2016-13). The new\ndisclosure requirements are adopted in regards to loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nThe required disclosures regarding gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination and loan modifications are\npresented under Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326 on July 1,\n2023, the Corporation did have any loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties during fiscal 2024.\n88\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2: Investment Securities\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nGross Gross Estimated\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Carrying\nJune 30, 2024 Cost Gains (Losses) Value Value\n(In Thousands)\nHeld to maturity\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS(1) $ 125,883 $ 76 $ (15,481) $ 110,478 $ 125,883\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO(2) 3,713 — (253) 3,460 3,713\nU.S. SBA securities(3) 455 — — 455 455\nTotal investment securities - held to maturity 130,051 76 (15,734) 114,393 130,051\nAvailable for sale\nU.S. government agency MBS(1) 1,222 — (14) 1,208 1,208\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS(1) 548 5 — 553 553\nPrivate issue CMO(2) 91 — (3) 88 88\nTotal investment securities - available for sale 1,861 5 (17) 1,849 1,849\nTotal investment securities $ 131,912 $ 81 $ (15,751) $ 116,242 $ 131,900\n(1) Mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).\n(2) Collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”).\n(3) Small Business Administration (\"SBA\").\nGross Gross Estimated\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Carrying\nJune 30, 2023 Cost Gains (Losses) Value Value\n(In Thousands)\nHeld to maturity\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS $ 149,803 $ — $ (18,459) $ 131,344 $ 149,803\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO 3,883 — (336) 3,547 3,883\nU.S. SBA securities 651 — (1) 650 651\nTotal investment securities - held to maturity 154,337 — (18,796) 135,541 154,337\nAvailable for sale\nU.S. government agency MBS 1,417 — (47) 1,370 1,370\nU.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS 697 — (14) 683 683\nPrivate issue CMO 103 — (1) 102 102\nTotal investment securities - available for sale 2,217 — (62) 2,155 2,155\nTotal investment securities $ 156,554 $ — $ (18,858) $ 137,696 $ 156,492\nIn fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Corporation received principal payments from its investment securities of $24.1 million and $30.7\nmillion, respectively and did not sell any investment securities.

At June 30, 2024, all of the $15.8 million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12 months or\nmore, while at June 30, 2023, $18.6 million of the $18.9 million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12\nmonths or more. The unrealized losses on investment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when\nthe investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities,\n90\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nwhich are predominately U.S. government sponsored enterprise (GSE) securities that are either explicitly or implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that\nthe unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating nature of interest rates, and not related to any potential credit risks within the\ninvestment portfolio. The Bank does not currently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity or\navailable for sale and as such, records the investment security at amortized cost or fair market value as prescribed by GAAP.\nAs a part of the Corporation’s monthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to\ndetermine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its\namortized costs basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Corporation’s assessment that the Corporation has the ability to\nhold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs is\nrealized and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the\namortized costs. There were no ACL or impairment on investment securities held to maturity and there was no impairment on\ninvestment securities available for sale at the adoption date of ASC 326 on July 1, 2023 and at June 30, 2024.\nIn order to maintain adequate liquidity, the Bank has established borrowing facilities with various counterparties. The Bank\nhad a remaining borrowing capacity of $261.3 million as of June 30, 2024 at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition, the\nBank has secured an estimated $208.6 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by\ninvestment securities totaling $126.6 million and loans held for investment totaling $178.6 million as of June 30, 2024. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the Bank also has an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its\ncorrespondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under the Federal Reserve discount window or\ncorrespondent bank facility as of June 30, 2024. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled\napproximately $519.9 million at June 30, 2024.\nAt June 30, 2023, the Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of $287.9 million at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition,\nthe Bank had secured an estimated $139.0 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by\ninvestment securities totaling $150.3 million at June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank also had an unsecured borrowing\narrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances\nunder the Federal Reserve discount window or the correspondent bank facility as of June 30, 2023. The total available\nborrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately $476.9 million at June 30, 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment securities\navailable for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until maturity. It\nalso determined that it was more likely than not that the Corporation would not be required to sell the securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis; therefore, no impairment losses were recorded on investment securities available for sale\nfor fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly\nreview of the adequacy of the ACL. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for\ncredit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.\nThe two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are\nindividually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. The collectively evaluated allowance is based on a\npooling method for groups of homogeneous loans sharing similar loan characteristics to calculate an allowance which reflects\nan estimate of lifetime expected credit losses using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Loans identified to be individually evaluated have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the\ncollateral, less selling costs or discounted cash flow with an appropriate default factor.\nThe Corporation categorizes all loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability\nof the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit\ndocumentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. A description of the general\ncharacteristics of the risk grades is as follows:\n● Pass – A pass loan ranges from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The likelihood of loss\nis considered remote.\n● Special Mention - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected,\nmay result in a loss. While concerns exist, the Corporation is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and\nnot imminent.\n● Substandard - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the\nborrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses,\nthat may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the\nCorporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n● Doubtful - A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts,\nconditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n95\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n● Loss - A loss loan is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Corporation\nis not warranted.\nThe following table presents the Corporation’s recorded investment in loans by risk categories and gross charge-offs by year\nof origination as of June 30, 2024:\nJune 30, 2024 Term Loans by Year of Origination Revolving\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Total\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nPass $ 19,476 $ 60,688 $ 205,817 $ 149,084 $ 19,606 $ 59,702 $ 14 $ 514,387\nSpecial Mention -

Under ASC 326, the ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans’ amortized cost\nbasis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on\nrelevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Corporation’s ACL is calculated quarterly, with any\ndifference in the calculated ACL and the recorded ACL trued-up through an entry to the provision for (recovery of) credit\nlosses. Management calculates the quantitative portion of the collectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an\naverage charge-off or loss rate methodology and generally evaluates collectively evaluated loans by Call Report code in order\nto group and determine portfolio loan segments with similar risk characteristics. The Corporation primarily utilizes historical\nloss rates for the CECL calculation based on its own specific historical losses and/or with peer loss history where applicable.\nThe expected loss rates are applied to expected monthly loan balances estimated through the consideration of contractual\nrepayment terms and expected prepayments. The prepayment assumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual\nlife of the loans are estimated based on historical and bank-specific experience and the consideration of current and expected\nconditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptions may be updated by\nmanagement in the event that changing conditions impact management’s estimate or additional historical data gathered has\nresulted in the need for a reevaluation.\nFor its reasonable and supportable forecasting of current expected credit losses, the Corporation utilizes a regression model\nusing forecasted economic metrics and historical loss data. The regression model utilized upon implementation of CECL\non July 1, 2023, and as of June 30, 2024, relied upon reasonable and supportable 12-month forecasts of the National\nUnemployment Rate and change in the Real Gross Domestic Product, after which it reverts to a historical loss rate.\nManagement selected the National Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic Product as the drivers of the forward\nlook component of the collectively evaluated allowance, primarily as a result of high correlation coefficients identified in\nregression modeling, the availability of forecasts, including the quarterly Federal Open Market Committee forecast, and the\nwidespread familiarity of these economic metrics.\nManagement recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in\nthe quantitative portion of allowance on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditions may vary compared\nwith conditions over the historical lookback period, which is utilized in the calculation of the quantitative allowance,\nmanagement considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loans may be warranted,\ngiven the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. The following qualitative factors (“Q-factors”) considered by\nmanagement reflect the regulatory guidance on the Q-factors:\n● Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.\n● Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.\n● The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n● Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that\naffect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.\n● The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of\nestimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio.\n● Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-performing loans, and the volume and\nseverity of adversely classified or graded loans.\n● Changes in the quality of the Corporation’s loan review system.\n● Changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans in the portfolio.\n● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off,\nand recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.\nThe qualitative portion of the Corporation’s allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using management\njudgment, to determine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative allowance is\nalso contingent upon the relative weighting of the Q-factors according to management’s judgment.\n98\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that\nforeclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair\nvalue of collateral at the reporting date, less selling costs.\nAccrued interest receivable for loans is included in accrued interest receivable in the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. The Corporation elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse\naccrued interest income on loans that are placed on non-performing status. A loan is deemed non-performing when it is 90\ndays or more delinquent. The Corporation believes this policy results in the timely reversal of potentially uncollectible\ninterest.\nPursuant to ASU 2022-02, “Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,” the Corporation may agree to different\ntypes of modifications, including principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extension, significant payment delay or\nany combination of modifications noted above. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, there were no loan modifications\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses\non the Corporation’s loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly\nbasis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of\noperations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions\nbeyond the Corporation’s control.\nNon-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed\nuncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days\ndelinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were previously modified\nfrom their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified as modified loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes\n90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent.\nThe amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the ACL. For\nmodified loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the ACL is segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for\nthose loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their modification period, classified lower than pass, and\ncontaining an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method.\nFor non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated\nallowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an\nindividually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for modified loans) or\ncollateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required.\nA non-performing loan can be restored to accrual status when a borrower is current in payments for six consecutive months.\n99\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following tables summarize the Corporation’s ACL and recorded investment in gross loans, by portfolio type, at the dates\nand for the years indicated.\nYear Ended June 30, 2024\nCommercial Commercial\n(In Thousands) Single-family Multi-family Real Estate Construction Other Mortgage Business Consumer Total\nACL:\nACL, beginning of period $ 1,720 $ 3,270 $ 868 $ 15 $ 2 $ 67 $ 4 $ 5,946\nAdjustment to ACL for adoption of\nASC 326 4,605 (2,614) (786) 47 3 (54) (4) 1,197\n(Recovery of) provision for credit\nlosses (30) (61) (16) 35 (4) (2) — (78)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — —\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — —\nACL, end of period $ 6,295 $ 595 $ 66 $ 97 $ 1 $ 11 $ — $ 7,065\nACL:\nIndividually evaluated for\nallowances $ 37 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 37\nCollectively evaluated for\nallowances 6,258 595 66 97 1 11 — 7,028\nACL, end of period $ 6,295 $ 595 $ 66 $ 97 $ 1 $ 11 $ — $ 7,065\nLoans held for investment:\nIndividually evaluated for\nallowances $ 1,134 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,134\nCollectively evaluated for\nallowances 516,957 445,182 83,349 2,692 95 1,372 65 1,049,712\nTotal loans held for investment,\ngross $ 518,091 $ 445,182 $ 83,349 $ 2,692 $ 95 $ 1,372 $ 65 $1,050,846\nACL on loans as a percentage of\ngross loans held for investment 1.22% 0.13% 0.08% 3.60% 1.05% 0.80% —% 0.67%\nNet (recoveries) charge-offs to\naverage loans receivable, net\nduring the period —% —% —% —% —% —% —% —%\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nCommercial Commercial\n(In Thousands) Single-family Multi-family Real Estate Construction Other Mortgage Business Consumer Total\nACL:\nACL, beginning of period $ 1,383 $ 3,282 $ 816 $ 23 $ 3 $ 52 $ 5 $ 5,564\nProvision for (recovery of) credit\nlosses 329 (12) 52 (8) (1) 15 (1) 374\nRecoveries 8 — — — — — — 8\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — —\nACL, end of period $ 1,720 $ 3,270 $ 868 $ 15 $ 2 $ 67 $ 4 $ 5,946\nACL:\nIndividually evaluated for\nallowances $ 37 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 37\nCollectively evaluated for\nallowances 1,683 3,270 868 15 2 67 4 5,909\nACL, end of period $ 1,720 $ 3,270 $ 868 $ 15 $ 2 $ 67 $ 4 $ 5,946\nLoans held for investment:\nIndividually evaluated for\nallowances $ 996 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 996\nCollectively evaluated for\nallowances 517,825 461,113 90,558 1,936 106 1,565 65 1,073,168\nTotal loans held for investment,\ngross $ 518,821 $ 461,113 $ 90,558 $ 1,936 $ 106 $ 1,565 $ 65 $ 1,074,164\nACL on loans as a percentage of\ngross loans held for investment 0.33% 0.71% 0.96% 0.77% 1.89% 4.28% 6.15% 0.55%\nNet (recoveries) charge-offs to\naverage loans receivable, net\nduring the period (0.00)% —% —% —% —% —% —% (0.00)%\n100\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following summarizes the components of the net change in the allowance for credit losses for the years indicated:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of year $ 5,946 $ 5,564\nAdjustment to ACL for adoption of ASC 326 1,197 —\n(Recovery of) provision for credit losses (78) 374\nRecoveries — 8\nCharge-offs — —\nBalance, end of year $ 7,065 $ 5,946\nThe following tables identify the Corporation’s total recorded investment in non-performing loans by type at the dates and for\nthe periods indicated. Generally, a loan is placed on non-performing status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or\ninterest or after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower’s financial condition\nis such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not\nrecognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan\nmay be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current, the borrower(s) has\ndemonstrated sustained payment performance and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected\non a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance have been (a) collectively evaluated using a pooling method analysis or (b)\nindividually evaluated using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less\ncosts to sell, to establish realizable value. This analysis may identify a specific allowance amount needed or may conclude that\nno allowance is needed.\nAt or For the Year Ended June 30, 2024\nUnpaid Net Average Interest\nPrincipal Related Recorded Recorded Recorded Income\n(In Thousands) Balance Charge-offs Investment ACL(1) Investment Investment Recognized\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nWith a related allowance $ 2,267 $ — $ 2,267 $ (73) $ 2,194 $ 1,627 $ 96\nWithout a related allowance(2) 427 (25) 402 — 402 444 23\nTotal single-family loans 2,694 (25) 2,669 (73) 2,596 2,071 119\nTotal non-performing loans $ 2,694 $ (25) $ 2,669 $ (73) $ 2,596 $ 2,071 $ 119\n(1) ACL, specifically assigned to the individual loan.\n(2) There was no related ACL because the loans were charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral was\nhigher than the loan balance.\nAt or For the Year Ended June 30, 2023\nUnpaid Net Average Interest\nPrincipal Related Recorded Recorded Recorded Income\n(In Thousands) Balance Charge-offs Investment ACL(1) Investment Investment Recognized\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nWith a related allowance $ 1,171 $ — $ 1,171 $ (122) $ 1,049 $ 996 $ 42\nWithout a related allowance(2) 276 (25) 251 — 251 112 —\nTotal single-family loans 1,447 (25) 1,422 (122) 1,300 1,108 42\nTotal non-performing loans $ 1,447 $ (25) $ 1,422 $ (122) $ 1,300 $ 1,108 $ 42\n(1) ACL, specifically assigned to the individual loan.\n(2) There was no related ACL because the loans were charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral was\nhigher than the loan balance.\n101\n\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to those borrowers whose loans were\nclassified as non-performing.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s average investment in non-performing loans was $2.1\nmillion and $1.1 million, respectively. The Corporation records payments on non-performing loans utilizing the cash basis or\ncost recovery method of accounting during the periods when the loans are on non-performing status. For the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2024, the Corporation received $119,000 in interest payments from non-performing loans, all of which was\nrecognized as interest income and none was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method. In\ncomparison, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Bank received $49,000 in interest payments from non-performing\nloans, of which $42,000 was recognized as interest income. The remaining $7,000 was applied to reduce the loan balances\nunder the cost recovery method.\nAs outlined in the implementation of ASC 326, the Bank includes the off-balance sheet reserve for unfunded loan\ncommitments within the provision for (recovery of) credit losses.\nThe following table provides information regarding the unfunded loan commitment reserve for the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of the year $ 42 $ 130\nImpact of ASC 326 CECL adoption — —\nProvision for (recovery of) credit losses 15 (88)\nBalance, end of the year $ 57 $ 42\nThe method for calculating the unfunded commitment reserve is based on a historical funding rate applied to the undisbursed\nloan amount to estimate an average outstanding amount during the life of the loan commitment. The Corporation applies the\nsame assumptions and methodologies by loan groupings to these unfunded loan commitments as it does for its funded loans\nheld for investment to determine the reserve rate and the allowance. Assumptions are evaluated by management periodically\nas part of the CECL procedures. The unfunded loan commitment reserve is recorded in accounts payable, accrued interest and\nother liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe following tables provide information on the past due status of the Corporation’s loans held for investment, gross, at the\ndates indicated.\nJune 30, 2024\n30-89 Days Past Total Loans Held for\n(In Thousands) Current Due Non-Accrual(1) Investment, Gross\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 515,498 $ — $ 2,593 $ 518,091\nMulti-family 445,182 — — 445,182\nCommercial real estate 83,349 — — 83,349\nConstruction 2,692 — — 2,692\nOther 95 — — 95\nCommercial business loans 1,372 — — 1,372\nConsumer loans 64 1 — 65\nTotal loans held for investment, gross $ 1,048,252 $ 1 $ 2,593 $ 1,050,846\n(1) All loans 90 days or greater past due are placed on non-accrual status.\n102\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023\n30-89 Days Past Total Loans Held for\n(In Thousands) Current Due Non-Accrual(1) Investment, Gross\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 517,399 $ — $ 1,422 $ 518,821\nMulti-family 461,113 — — 461,113\nCommercial real estate 90,558 — — 90,558\nConstruction 1,936 — — 1,936\nOther 106 — — 106\nCommercial business loans 1,565 — — 1,565\nConsumer loans 64 1 — 65\nTotal loans held for investment, gross $ 1,072,741 $ 1 $ 1,422 $ 1,074,164\n(1) All loans 90 days or greater past due are placed on non-accrual status.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank may offer loans to its directors, officers and employees on substantially the same\nterms prevailing at the time of origination for comparable transactions with unaffiliated borrowers. During fiscal 2024 and\n2023, there were no related-party loan activities and as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding related-party\nloans.\nNote 4: Leases\nThe Corporation accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842, which was implemented on July 1, 2019, and requires\nthe Corporation to record liabilities for future lease obligations as well as assets representing the right to use the underlying\nleased assets. The Corporation’s leases primarily represent future obligations to make payments for the use of buildings, space\nor equipment for its operations. Liabilities to make future lease payments are recorded in accounts payable, accrued interest\nand other liabilities, while right-of-use assets are recorded in premises and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition. At June 30, 2024, all the Corporation’s leases were classified as operating leases and the Corporation did\nnot have any operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (“short-term leases”).\nLiabilities to make future lease payments and right-of-use assets are recorded for operating leases and do not include short-\nterm leases. These liabilities and right-of-use assets are determined based on the total contractual base rents for each lease,\nwhich include options to extend or renew each lease, where applicable, and where the Corporation believes it has an economic\nincentive to extend or renew the lease. Since lease extensions are not reasonably certain, the Corporation generally does not\nrecognize payments occurring during option periods in the calculation of its operating right-of-use lease assets and operating\nlease liabilities. The Bank utilizes the FHLB - San Francisco interest rates as a discount rate for each of the remaining\ncontractual terms at the adoption date as well as for future leases if the discount rate is not stated in the lease. For leases that\ncontain variable lease payments, the Corporation assumes future lease payment escalations based on a lease payment\nescalation rate specified in the lease or the specified index rate observed at the time of lease commencement. Liabilities to\nmake future lease payments are accounted for using the interest method, being reduced by periodic contractual lease payments\nnet of periodic interest accretion. Right-of-use assets for operating leases are amortized over the term of the associated lease\nby amounts that represent the difference between periodic straight-line lease expense and periodic interest accretion in the\nrelated liability to make future lease payments.\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, expenses associated with the Corporation’s leases totaled $927,000 and\n$882,000, respectively, and were recorded in premises and occupancy expenses and equipment expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\n103\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents supplemental information related to operating leases at the date and for the years indicated:\nAs of June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Condition:\nPremises and equipment - Operating lease right of use assets $ 1,356 $ 2,147\nAccounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities – Operating lease liabilities $ 1,407 $ 2,169\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Operations:\nPremises and occupancy expenses from operating leases(1) $ 789 $ 787\nEquipment expenses from operating leases(1) 138 95\nTotal lease expense $ 927 $ 882\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases, net $ 884 $ 879\n(1) Includes immaterial variable lease costs.\nThe following table provides information related to remaining minimum contractual lease payments and other information\nassociated with the Corporation’s leases as of June 30, 2024:\nAmount(1)\nYear Ending June 30, (In Thousands)\n2025 $ 678\n2026 387\n2027 192\n2028 156\n2029 74\nThereafter —\nTotal contract lease payments $ 1,487\nTotal liability to make lease payments $ 1,407\nDifference in undiscounted and discounted future lease payments $ 80\nWeighted average discount rate 3.34 %\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 3.0\n(1) Contractual base rents do not include property taxes and other operating expenses due under respective lease agreements.\n104\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5: Premises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment at June 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:\nJune 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nLand $ 2,853 $ 2,853\nBuildings 10,136 10,311\nLeasehold improvements 4,065 3,135\nFurniture and equipment 5,458 5,226\nAutomobiles 149 176\nOperating lease – right of use assets (1) 1,356 2,147\n24,017 23,848\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (14,704) (14,617)\nTotal premises and equipment, net $ 9,313 $ 9,231\n(1) Net of accumulated amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $1.6 million and $1.4\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 6: Deposits\nDeposits at June 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\n(Dollars in Thousands) Interest Rate Amount Interest Rate Amount\nChecking deposits – noninterest-bearing — $ 95,627 — $ 103,006\nChecking deposits – interest-bearing(1) 0.00% - 0.20% 254,624 0.00% - 0.20% 302,872\nSavings deposits(1) 0.00% - 4.64% 238,878 0.00% - 0.70% 290,204\nMoney market deposits(1) 0.00% - 4.64% 25,324 0.00% - 2.00% 33,551\nTime deposits:\n$250 and under(1)(2) 0.00% - 5.35% 226,110 0.00% - 5.25% 192,147\nOver $250 0.10% - 5.12% 47,785 0.10% - 5.35% 28,791\nTotal deposits(3) $ 888,348 $ 950,571\nWeighted average interest rate on deposits 1.29 % 0.73 %\n(1) Certain interest-bearing checking, savings, money market and time deposits require a minimum balance to earn interest.\n(2) Includes brokered certificates of deposit of $131.8 million and $106.4 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(3) Includes uninsured deposits of approximately $122.7 million and $140.1 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe aggregate annual maturities of time deposits at June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nJune 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nOne year or less $ 245,713 $ 166,501\nOver one to two years 19,604 37,062\nOver two to three years 3,779 9,922\nOver three to four years 1,896 3,069\nOver four to five years 1,649 2,578\nOver five years 1,254 1,806\nTotal time deposits $ 273,895 $ 220,938\n105\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInterest expense on deposits for the years indicated is summarized as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nChecking deposits – interest-bearing $ 118 $ 140\nSavings deposits 313 168\nMoney market deposits 172 87\nTime deposits 9,063 2,751\nTotal interest expense on deposits $ 9,666 $ 3,146\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had related party deposits of approximately $6.3 million, compared to $8.1 million at June 30,\n2023.

If a tax\nposition does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the\nfinancial statements. Management has determined that there were no unrecognized tax benefits to be reported in the\nCorporation’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income\ntaxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\n107\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nrespective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe Corporation’s effective tax rate may differ from the estimated statutory tax rates described above due to discrete items\nsuch as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable\nearnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items.\nThe Corporation utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are\nrecognized for deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for\ntaxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more\nlikely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nadjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe provision for income taxes for the years indicated consisted of the following:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 2,161 $ 1,638\nState 1,278 955\n3,439 2,593\nDeferred:\nFederal (238) 783\nState (165) 448\n(403) 1,231\nProvision for income taxes $ 3,036 $ 3,824\nThe Corporation’s tax expense from non-qualified stock-based compensation recognized in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09 for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was $0 and $186,000, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory\nfederal income tax rate to net income before income taxes as a result of the following differences for the years indicated:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands) Amount Tax Rate Amount Tax Rate\nFederal income tax at statutory rate $ 2,181 21.00 % $ 2,607 21.00 %\nState income tax, net of federal income tax benefit 880 8.48 % 1,107 8.92 %\nChanges in taxes resulting from:\nBank-owned life insurance (39) (0.38)% (39) (0.31)%\nNon-deductible expenses 12 0.12 % 11 0.09 %\nShortfall on stock-based compensation — — % 132 1.06 %\nReturn to provision adjustment (1) (0.01)% 4 0.03 %\nOther 3 0.02 % 2 0.01 %\nEffective income tax $ 3,036 29.23 % $ 3,824 30.80 %\n108\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDeferred tax assets at June 30, 2024 and 2023 by jurisdiction were as follows:\nJune 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nDeferred taxes - federal $ 404 $ 179\nDeferred taxes - state 202 39\nTotal net deferred tax assets $ 606 $ 218\nNet deferred tax assets at June 30, 2024 and 2023 were comprised of the following:\nJune 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nLoss reserves $ 2,387 $ 2,032\nNon-accrued interest 175 188\nDeferred compensation 2,388 2,339\nAccrued vacation 187 194\nDepreciation 174 155\nState tax 203 199\nUnrealized loss on investment securities 4 19\nLease liability 448 691\nOther 208 288\nTotal deferred tax assets 6,174 6,105\nFHLB - San Francisco stock dividends (645) (645)\nPrepaid expenses (39) (45)\nUnrealized gain on interest-only strips (3) (3)\nRight-of-use asset (432) (684)\nDeferred loan costs, net (4,449) (4,510)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (5,568) (5,887)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 606 $ 218\nThe net deferred tax assets were included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. The Corporation analyzes the deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required based on\nthe more-likely-than-not criteria that such assets will be realized principally through future taxable income. This criteria takes\ninto account the actual earnings and the estimates of future profitability. The Corporation may carryback net federal tax losses\nto the preceding five taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCorporation had no federal and state net tax loss carryforwards. Based on management’s consideration of historical and\nanticipated future income before income taxes, as well as the reversal period for the items giving rise to the deferred tax assets\nand liabilities, a valuation allowance was not considered necessary at June 30, 2024 and 2023 and management believes it is\nmore likely than not the Corporation will realize its deferred tax asset.\nRetained earnings at June 30, 2024 and 2023 include approximately $9.0 million (pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes)\nfor which federal income tax of $3.1 million has not been provided. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for federal\nincome tax purposes are later used for purposes other than for bad debt losses, including distribution in liquidation, they will\nbe subject to federal income tax at the then-current corporate tax rate. If those amounts are not so used, they will not be\nsubject to tax even in the event the Bank were to convert its charter from a thrift to a bank.\nThe Corporation files income tax returns for the United States and California jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has\naudited the Bank’s income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through\n1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporation’s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and\n2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporation’s income tax returns for\n109\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal years 2022 and thereafter remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax\nreturns for fiscal years 2021 and thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities.\nIt is the Corporation’s policy to record any penalties or interest charges arising from federal or state taxes as a component of\nincome tax expense. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no tax penalties and no interest charges\narising from federal or state taxes.\nNote 9: Capital\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that,\nif undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines\nand the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve\nquantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory\naccounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators\nabout components, risk weightings and other factors.\nFor a bank holding company such as the Corporation with less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a\nbank only basis. The FRB expects the holding company’s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective\naction regulations. If the Corporation was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies at June 30, 2024, it\nwould have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Bank is subject to capital regulations which establish minimum required capital ratios for Tier 1 leverage, common equity\nTier 1 (“CET1”), Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital. Additionally, a capital conservation buffer is required over the\nrequired minimum capital ratios, and capital regulations also defines what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the\ncapital requirements. Failure to meet minimum requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation’s financial\nstatements.\nIn addition to the minimum capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1\ncapital greater than 2.5% above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in\nshare repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized\nfor such actions.\n110\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Bank’s actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios at the dates indicated are as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nRegulatory Requirements\nMinimum for Capital Minimum to Be\nActual Adequacy Purposes(1) Well Capitalized\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B.:\nAs of June 30, 2024(2)\nTier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average\nassets) $ 126,601 10.02 % $ 50,555 4.00 % $ 63,194 5.00 %\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 126,601 19.29 % $ 45,934 7.00 % $ 42,653 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 126,601 19.29 % $ 55,777 8.50 % $ 52,496 8.00 %\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 133,723 20.38 % $ 68,900 10.50 % $ 65,620 10.00 %\nAs of June 30, 2023\nTier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average\nassets) $ 125,979 9.59 % $ 52,521 4.00 % $ 65,651 5.00 %\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 125,979 18.50 % $ 47,674 7.00 % $ 44,269 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 125,979 18.50 % $ 57,890 8.50 % $ 54,485 8.00 %\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 131,967 19.38 % $ 71,511 10.50 % $ 68,106 10.00 %\n(1) Inclusive of the conservation buffer of 2.50% for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios.\n(2) The Bank elected to recognize the full $824 thousand adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of CECL\non July 1, 2023 instead of over the permitted three-year phase-in option.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank was categorized as \"well-capitalized\" at\nJune 30, 2024 under the regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).\nThe ability of Provident Financial Holdings to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily on the ability of the Bank to\npay dividends to Provident Financial Holdings. Provident Financial Holdings and the Bank may not declare or pay cash\ndividends on or repurchase any of its shares of common stock, if the effect would cause stockholders’ equity to be reduced\nbelow applicable regulatory capital maintenance requirements or if such declaration and payment would otherwise violate\nregulatory requirements.\nGenerally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that are well-capitalized before and after the proposed distribution may make\ncapital distributions during any calendar year up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the\ntwo preceding years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or classified as troubled\ncondition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital\ndistribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will\nexceed the net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the\nBank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the FRB. The FRB or the OCC may object to a capital distribution\nbased on safety and soundness concerns. Additional restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the Qualified\nThrift Lender test. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Bank declared and paid $7.0 million and $9.5 million of cash dividends to its\nparent, Provident Financial Holdings, respectively.\nNote 10: Benefit Plans\nThe Corporation has a 401(k) defined-contribution plan covering all employees meeting specific age and service\nrequirements. Under the plan, employees may contribute to the plan from their pretax compensation up to the limits set by the\nInternal Revenue Service. The Corporation makes matching contributions up to 3% of a participants’ pretax compensation.\nParticipants vest immediately in their own contributions with 100% vesting in the Corporation’s\n111\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontributions occurring after six years of credited service. The Corporation’s expense for the plan was approximately\n$303,000 and $306,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Corporation has a multi-year employment agreement and a post-retirement compensation agreement with one executive\nofficer. In addition, the Corporation has a transition agreement and a post-retirement compensation agreement with the\nprevious executive officer (currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors). At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the accrued liability\nof the post-retirement compensation agreements was $5.7 million at both dates; any costs (recoveries) are being accrued and\nexpensed quarterly. In fiscal 2024, the increase in the discount rate and a lower life expectancy was offset by a higher current\ncompensation. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the accrued expense (recovery) for these liabilities was $85,000 and $(1.1 million),\nrespectively. The current obligation for these post-retirement benefits was fully funded consistent with contractual\nrequirements and actuarially determined estimates of the total future obligation. The Corporation invests in BOLI to provide\nsufficient funding for these post-retirement obligations. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding cash surrender\nvalue of the BOLI was $8.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, total BOLI non-taxable income,\nnet of mortality cost, was $186,000 for both periods.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Corporation established an ESOP on June 27, 1996 for all employees who are age 21 or older and have completed\none year of service with the Corporation during which they have served a minimum of 1,000 hours.\nThe Corporation recognizes compensation expense when the Corporation contributes funds to the ESOP for the purchase of\nthe Corporation’s common stock to be allocated to the ESOP participants. The Corporation's contribution to the ESOP plan is\ndiscretionary. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, there were 40,000 shares for each year that were purchased in the open market to\nfulfill the annual discretionary allocation. Since the annual contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the\nESOP cannot be estimated.\nBenefits generally become 100% vested after six years of credited service. Vesting accelerates upon retirement, death or\ndisability of the participant or in the event of a change in control of the Corporation. Forfeitures are reallocated among\nremaining participating employees in the same proportion as contributions. Benefits are payable upon death, retirement, early\nretirement, disability or separation from service.\nThe net expense related to the ESOP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $540,000 and $563,000,\nrespectively. Available shares and cash contributions, if any, are allocated every calendar year end. The total ESOP allocation\nfor calendar 2023 was 40,000 shares, as compared to 20,000 shares and $317,000 of cash contributions for calendar 2022.\nNote 11: Incentive Plans\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Corporation had four share-based compensation plans: the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (“2022 Plan”);\nthe 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (“2013 Plan”); the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Plan”); and the 2006 Equity Incentive\nPlan (“2006 Plan”), collectively, the “Plans”. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the compensation cost for the\nPlans was $240,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.\nEquity Incentive Plans. The Corporation established the Plans, which were all approved by shareholders for directors,\nadvisory directors, directors emeriti, officers and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiary. The 2022 Plan authorizes\n175,000 stock options and 200,000 shares of restricted stock. The 2022 Plan also provides that no person may be granted more\nthan 35,000 stock options or 30,000 shares of restricted stock in any one year. The 2013 Plan authorizes 300,000 stock options\nand 300,000 shares of restricted stock. The 2013 Plan also provides that no person may be granted more than 60,000 stock\noptions or 45,000 shares of restricted stock in any one year. The 2010 Plan authorized 586,250 stock options and 288,750\nshares of restricted stock. The 2006 Plan authorized 365,000 stock options and 185,000 shares of restricted stock. As of June\n30, 2024, equity awards may be granted only from the 2022 Plan, while no new equity awards can be granted from the 2013\nPlan, 2010 Plan and 2006 Plan.\nEquity Incentive Plans - Stock Options. Under the Plans, options may not be granted at a price less than the fair market\nvalue at the date of the grant. Options typically vest over a five-year or shorter period as long as the director, advisory\n112\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ndirector, director emeritus, officer or employee remains in service to the Corporation. The options are exercisable after vesting\nfor up to the remaining term of the original grant. The maximum term of the options granted is 10 years.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following\nassumptions as of the grant date for the periods indicated. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from historical\ncommon stock closing prices for the prior 84 months. The expected dividend yield is based on the most recent quarterly\ndividend on an annualized basis. The expected term is based on the historical experience of all fully vested stock option grants\nand is reviewed annually. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury note rate with a term similar to the\nunderlying stock option on the particular grant date.\nFiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023\nExpected volatility 21.6% - 22.9 % 20.3 %\nWeighted average volatility 22.5 % 20.3 %\nExpected dividend yield 4.5 % 3.9 %\nExpected term (in years) 7.4 7.3\nRisk-free interest rate 4.3 % 2.9 %\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 77,000 options available for future grants under the 2022 Plan. As of June 30, 2023, there\nwere 175,000 options available for future grants under the 2022 Plan and 21,000 options available for future grants under the\n2013 Plan.\nThe following tables summarize the stock option activity in the Plans during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nAverage Remaining Intrinsic\nExercise Contractual Value\nOptions Shares Price Term (Years) ($000)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2022 431,000 $ 16.24\nGranted 30,000 $ 14.52\nExercised — $ —\nForfeited (7,500) $ 20.19\nExpired (19,000) $ 16.47\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 434,500 $ 16.04 3.01 $ —\nVested and expected to vest at June 30, 2023 425,700 $ 16.06 2.89 $ —\nExercisable at June 30, 2023 390,500 $ 16.13 2.34 $ —\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 434,500 $ 16.04\nGranted 98,000 $ 12.44\nExercised — $ —\nForfeited (5,000) $ 14.52\nExpired (47,500) $ 15.71\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 480,000 $ 15.35 3.29 $ —\nVested and expected to vest at June 30, 2024 475,950 $ 16.36 3.25 $ —\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 355,000 $ 16.18 1.14 $ —\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there was $231,000 and $72,000 of unrecognized compensation expense, respectively, related\nto unvested share-based compensation arrangements with respect to stock options issued under the Plans. The expense is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years and 2.9 years, respectively. The forfeiture rate during\nfiscal 2024 and 2023 was 15% and 20%, respectively, and was calculated by using the historical forfeiture experience of all\nfully vested stock option grants which is reviewed annually.\n113\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nEquity Incentive Plans – Restricted Stock. Awarded shares typically vest over a five-year or shorter period as long as the\ndirector, advisory director, director emeriti, officer or employee remains in service to the Corporation. Once vested, a recipient\nof restricted stock will have all rights of a shareholder, including the power to vote and the right to receive dividends. The\nCorporation recognizes compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based on the fair value of the shares at the award\ndate.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 69,000 shares available for future awards under the 2022 Plan. As of June 30, 2023, there\nwere 200,000 shares available for future awards under the 2022 Plan and 18,250 shares available for future awards under the\n2013 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nWeighted Average\nAward Date\nUnvested Shares Shares Fair Value\nUnvested at June 30, 2022 94,750 $ 18.57\nAwarded 53,000 $ 12.95\nVested (93,750) $ 18.57\nForfeited (3,000) $ 14.82\nUnvested at June 30, 2023 51,000 $ 12.95\nExpected to vest at June 30, 2023 40,800 $ 12.95\nUnvested at June 30, 2023 51,000 $ 12.95\nAwarded 131,000 $ 11.08\nVested (2,000) $ 12.09\nForfeited (3,350) $ 12.95\nUnvested at June 30, 2024 176,650 $ 11.57\nExpected to vest at June 30, 2024 150,153 $ 11.57\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the unrecognized compensation expense was $1.8 million and $544,000, respectively, related\nto unvested share-based compensation arrangements with respect to restricted stock issued under the Plans, and reported as a\nreduction to stockholders’ equity. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years and\n3.1 years, respectively. Similar to stock options, a forfeiture rate of 15% and 20% was applied to the restricted stock\ncompensation expense calculations in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthe fair value of shares vested and distributed was $24,000 and $1.1 million, respectively.\nNote 12: Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by\nthe weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur\nif securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the\nissuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Corporation.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were outstanding options to purchase 480,000 shares and 434,500 shares of the\nCorporation’s common stock, of which 382,000 shares and 434,500 shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS\ncomputation as their effect was anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were outstanding restricted stock awards of\n176,650 shares and 51,000 shares, respectively.\n114\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table provides the basic and diluted EPS computations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively:\nFor the Year Ended June 30, 2024\nIncome Shares Per-Share\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share Amount) (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\nBasic EPS $ 7,351 6,942,918 $ 1.06\nEffect of dilutive shares:\nStock options 76\nRestricted stock 16,149\nDiluted EPS $ 7,351 6,959,143 $ 1.06\nFor the Year Ended June 30, 2023\nIncome Shares Per-Share\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share Amount) (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\nBasic EPS $ 8,592 7,143,273 $ 1.20\nEffect of dilutive shares:\nStock options —\nRestricted stock 48,412\nDiluted EPS $ 8,592 7,191,685 $ 1.19\nNote 13: Commitments and Contingencies\nPeriodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens,\ncondemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and\nservicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the\nCorporation’s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual\nmatters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the\nCorporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it\nbelieves would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nThe Corporation conducts a portion of its operations in leased facilities and has maintenance contracts under non-cancelable\nagreements classified as operating leases, which include leases recorded under ASC 842 on liabilities for future lease\nobligations as well as assets representing the right-to-use the underlying leased assets (See Note 4 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements).\nThe following is a schedule of the Corporation’s lease and operating commitments:\nAmount\nYear Ending June 30, (In Thousands)\n2025 $ 1,837\n2026 1,139\n2027 358\n2028 156\n2029 74\nThereafter —\nTotal minimum payments required $ 3,564\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the lease and operating commitment expense was approximately $2.3\nmillion and $1.9 million, respectively.\n115\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Bank sold single-family mortgage loans to unrelated third parties with standard representation and warranty provisions in\nthe ordinary course of its business activities. Under these provisions, the Bank is required to repurchase any previously sold\nloan for which the representations or warranties of the Bank prove to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. In the event of\na borrower default or fraud, pursuant to a breached representation or warranty, the Bank may be required to reimburse the\ninvestor for any losses suffered. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank maintained a non-contingent recourse liability related\nto these representations and warranties of $18,000 and $25,000, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintained a recourse\nliability of $8,000 at both June 30, 2024 and 2023 for loans sold to the FHLB – San Francisco under the MPF program.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into contracts with third parties under which the third parties\nprovide services on behalf of the Corporation. In many of these contracts, the Corporation agrees to indemnify the third party\nservice provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnity vary from contract to contract and the amount of the\nindemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined. The Corporation also enters into other contracts and agreements; such\nas, loan sale agreements, litigation settlement agreements, confidentiality agreements, loan servicing agreements, leases and\nsubleases, among others, in which the Corporation agrees to indemnify third parties for acts by the Corporation’s agents,\nassignees and/or sub-lessees, and employees. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, the Corporation cannot\ncalculate its aggregate potential exposure.\nPursuant to their governing instruments, the Corporation and its subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors, officers,\nemployees and, in some cases, agents of the Corporation against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on\nbehalf of or at the request of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. It is not possible for the Corporation to determine the\naggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to provide this indemnity.\nNote 14: Derivative and Other Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risks\nThe Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating\nloans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale commitments to third parties and option contracts. These\ninstruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-\nperformance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.\nThe Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for\non-balance sheet instruments. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had commitments to extend credit on loans to be\nheld for investment of $9.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nThe following table provides information at the dates indicated regarding undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of\ncredit with the Corporation as well as commitments to originate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below:\nJune 30,\nCommitments 2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nUndisbursed loan funds – Construction loans $ 435 $ 2,032\nUndisbursed lines of credit – Commercial business loans 2,936 607\nUndisbursed lines of credit – Consumer loans 341 363\nCommitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment 9,387 2,394\nTotal $ 13,099 $ 5,396\n116\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 15: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Corporation adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” and elected the fair value option pursuant to\nASC 825, “Financial Instruments” on single-family loans originated for sale. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 825 permits entities to elect\nto measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument\nbasis (the “Fair Value Option”) at specified election dates. At each subsequent reporting date, an entity is required to report\nunrealized gains and losses on items in earnings for which the fair value option has been elected. The objective of the Fair\nValue Option is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported\nearnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting\nprovisions.\nThe following table describes the difference at the dates indicated between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans held for investment at fair value:\nAggregate\nUnpaid Net\nAggregate Principal Unrealized\n(In Thousands) Fair Value Balance Loss\nAs of June 30, 2024:\nLoans held for investment, at fair value $ 1,047 $ 1,200 $ (153)\nAs of June 30, 2023:\nLoans held for investment, at fair value $ 1,312 $ 1,483 $ (171)\nASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value\ncalculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability\nto access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or\nliability. Valuation techniques may include the use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks.\nThese unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation’s estimate of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted\ncash flow models and similar techniques.\nASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a\nfinancial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the\nlowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation.\nThe Corporation’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities\navailable for sale, loans held for investment at fair value, other equity investments and interest-only strips; while loans with\nindividually evaluated allowances and mortgage servicing assets (“MSA”) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nInvestment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government\nsponsored enterprise MBS, private issue CMO and investment in equity securities. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in\nactive markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS and investment in equity securities (Level 2) and\nbroker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the private issue CMO\n(Level 3).\n117\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale.\nThe fair value is determined by management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan, in addition to the\nquoted secondary-market prices which account for the interest rate characteristics of each loan (Level 3).\nLoans with individually evaluated allowance that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are loans which are\ninadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or of the collateral pledged. These\nloans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected. The fair value of a loan with an individually evaluated allowance is determined based on the discounted cash flow\nor current appraised value of the underlying collateral. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on\nmanagement’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management’s expertise\nand knowledge of the collateral. For commercial real estate loans with an individually evaluated allowance, the fair value is\nderived from the appraised value of its collateral. Loans with an individually evaluated allowance are reviewed and evaluated\non at least a quarterly basis for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above\n(Level 3). This loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), but\nrather as a component in determining the overall adequacy of the ACL. These adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans\nwith an individually evaluated allowance may result in increases or decreases to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses\nrecorded in current earnings.\nThe fair value of other equity investments is derived from quoted prices in active markets for the equivalent or similar\ninvestments (Level 2).\nThe Corporation uses the amortization method for its MSA, which amortizes the MSA in proportion to and over the period of\nestimated net servicing income and assesses the MSA for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair value\nof the MSA is derived using the present value method; which includes a third party’s prepayment projections of similar\ninstruments, weighted average coupon rates, estimated servicing costs and discount interest rates (Level 3).\nThe fair value of interest-only strips is derived using the same assumptions that are used to value the related MSA (Level 3).\nThe Corporation’s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable\nvalue or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporation’s valuation methodologies are\nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the\nfair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n118\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following fair value hierarchy tables present information at the dates indicated about the Corporation’s assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurement at June 30, 2024 Using:\n(In Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestment securities -

Significant increases or decreases in any\nof these inputs in isolation could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The various unobservable\ninputs used to determine valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. For the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024, there were no significant changes to the Corporation's valuation techniques and inputs that had, or are expected to have,\na material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n121\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe carrying amount and fair value of the Corporation’s other financial instruments as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as\nfollows:\nJune 30, 2024\nCarrying Fair\n(In Thousands) Amount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair value $ 1,051,932 $ 973,453 $ — $ — $ 973,453\nInvestment securities - held to maturity $ 130,051 $ 114,393 $ — $ 114,393 $ —\nFHLB – San Francisco stock $ 9,568 $ 9,568 $ — $ 9,568 $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 888,348 $ 888,527 $ — $ 888,527 $ —\nBorrowings $ 238,500 $ 237,691 $ — $ 237,691 $ —\nJune 30, 2023\nCarrying Fair\n(In Thousands) Amount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair value $ 1,076,317 $ 970,277 $ — $ — $ 970,277\nInvestment securities - held to maturity $ 154,337 $ 135,541 $ — $ 135,541 $ —\nFHLB – San Francisco stock $ 9,505 $ 9,505 $ — $ 9,505 $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 950,571 $ 949,116 $ — $ 949,116 $ —\nBorrowings $ 235,009 $ 232,764 $ — $ 232,764 $ —\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair value: For loans that reprice frequently at market rates, the carrying amount\napproximates the fair value. For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future\ncash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which such loans\nwould be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices.\nInvestment securities - held to maturity: The investment securities - held to maturity consist of U.S. SBA securities, U.S.\ngovernment sponsored enterprise MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO. For the U.S. SBA securities and U.S.\ngovernment sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar\nsecurities for its fair value measurement (Level 2).\nFHLB – San Francisco stock is carried at cost/par value and represents its fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will\nreceive an amount equal to the par value of the stock.\nDeposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based\nupon observable inputs, including rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of\ntransaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand.\nBorrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on\nsuch borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.\nThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation\ngenerally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily\nutilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The\nCorporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the\nvaluation process.\nWhile the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of\ndifferent methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a\n122\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, there were no significant changes\nto the Corporation’s valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations.\nNote 16: Revenue From Contracts With Customers\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to the customer in exchange for\nthe consideration the Corporation expects to be entitled to receive. The largest portion of the Corporation’s revenue is from\ninterest income, which is not in the scope of ASC 606. All the Corporation’s revenue from contracts with customers in the\nscope of ASC 606 is recognized in non-interest income.\nIf a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Corporation recognizes revenue as it satisfies a performance\nobligation. Payments from customers are generally collected at the time services are rendered, monthly, or quarterly. For\ncontracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is either earned at a point in time or revenue is earned over\ntime. Examples of revenue earned at a point in time are automated teller machine (\"ATM\") transaction fees, wire transfer fees,\noverdraft fees and interchange fees. Revenue is primarily based on the number and type of transactions that are generally\nderived from transactional information accumulated by the Corporation’s systems and is recognized immediately as the\ntransactions occur or upon providing the service to complete the customer's transaction. The Corporation is generally the\nprincipal in these contracts, with the exception of interchanges fees, in which case the Corporation is acting as the agent and\nrecords revenue net of expenses paid to the principal. Examples of revenue earned over time, which generally occur on a\nmonthly basis, are deposit account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, merchant revenue, trust and investment\nmanagement fees and safe deposit box fees. Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by its\nsystems or those of third-parties and is recognized as the related transactions occur or services are rendered to the customer.\nDisaggregation of Revenue:\nThe following table includes the Corporation's non-interest income disaggregated by type of services for the fiscal years ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended June 30,\nType of Services 2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nLoan servicing and other fees(1) $ 337 $ 414\nDeposit account fees 1,154 1,296\nCard and processing fees 1,384 1,525\nOther(2) 1,066 840\nTotal non-interest income $ 3,941 $ 4,075\n(1) Not within the scope of ASC 606.\n(2) Includes income on BOLI of $186 thousand and $186 thousand, net loss on sale of loans of $66 thousand and net gain on\nsale of loans of $124 thousand and net unrealized gain on other equity investments of $540 thousand and $0 for the fiscal\nyears ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are not within the scope of ASC 606.\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, substantially all the Corporation’s revenues within the scope of ASC 606\nwere for performance obligations satisfied at a specified date.\nRevenues recognized within the scope of ASC 606:\nDeposit account fees: Fees are earned on the Bank's deposit accounts for various products offered to or services performed for\nthe Bank's customers. Fees include business account fees, non-sufficient fund fees, ATM fees and others. These fees are\nrecognized on a daily, monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of service.\nCard and processing fees: Debit interchange income represents fees earned when a debit card issued by the Bank is used. The\nBank earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions through a third party payment network. Interchange fees\n123\nTable of Contents\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfrom cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently\nwith the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are\nearned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholders' debit card. Certain expenses directly associated with the\ndebit cards are recorded on a net basis with the interchange income.\nOther: Includes asset management fees, stop payment fees, wire services fees, safe deposit box fees and other fees earned on\nother services, such as merchant services or occasional non-recurring type services, are recognized at the time of the event or\nthe applicable billing cycle. Asset management fees are variable, since they are based on the underlying portfolio value, which\nis subject to market conditions and amounts invested by customers through a third-party provider. Asset management fees are\nrecognized over the period that services are provided, and when the portfolio values are known or can be estimated at the end\nof each month.\nNote 17: Holding Company Condensed Financial Information\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the other notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Last year at this time, it was noted in the\nChairman’s Message that, “Current general economic conditions do not seem to be improving and the Federal Open Market Committee\n(“FOMC”) has responded to higher inflation data by raising the federal funds rate to the highest level in 22 years and at the quickest pace in\n40 years.” A year later and inflation numbers are finally starting to decline in a consistent manner. Like many others, we began the 2024\ncalendar year believing that rate cuts were likely and there would be multiple rate cuts in the year. Today, we are more than half way through\nthe year and we are still waiting for the rate cuts to materialize. But we may finally start to see some rate relief as the FOMC has recently\nsignaled that inflation is declining, which would allow for a less restrictive monetary policy. Throughout this last fiscal year, we have\ncontinued to be good stewards of our capital by executing a strategy that called for us to slow growth in a potential recessionary environment\nand work to ensure strong credit quality. This conservative credit culture has served us well in the past and continues to do so in the present,\nparticularly in light of the elevated credit risk around commercial real estate loans.\nFiscal 2024\nOverall, our fiscal 2024 financial results, described in the following Financial Highlights, reflected a decline in both net income and\ntotal assets compared to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2024, operating conditions were challenging with the macroeconomic headwinds\nof an inverted yield curve, higher interest rates, high inflation, rising unemployment rates and modest gross domestic product growth. As a\nresult, the Bank made the strategic decision to restrict loan growth and took a defensive position with the balance sheet, resulting in a lower\nbalance of loans held for investment, but thereby limiting new exposures to credit risk. In addition, the deposit environment was highly\ncompetitive and depositors were actively seeking higher rates for their deposits. This resulted in a decline in our total deposits and an\nincrease in our interest expense as we were competing to retain those relationships or replace them with higher cost funding sources.\nLast year, we described that our fiscal 2024 Business Plan forecast disciplined growth in loans held for investment, growth in retail\ndeposits (primarily core deposits), control of operating expenses, and sound capital management decisions. The Business Plan was\npredicated on the forecast of gradual rate cuts by the FOMC and the beginning of the return to a normally sloped yield curve.\nBut when the rate environment we envisioned did not materialize, we deviated from the Business Plan as it relates to loan growth. Loan\noriginations and purchases for the held for investment portfolio were $75.5 million in fiscal 2024, a 68 percent decrease from the fiscal 2023\nvolume, and loan prepayments exceeded new loan origination volume resulting in a two percent decrease in loans held for investment. On\nthe funding side, core deposits decreased by $115.1 million or 16 percent at June 30, 2024 from the same date last year as a result of\ndepositors moving funds into higher yielding investment opportunities and were partially replaced with brokered certificates of deposit such\nthat total deposits declined by seven percent. Operating expenses for fiscal 2024 increased by approximately one percent from the prior year\nresulting from the inflationary environment but were well-controlled. Last year, we mentioned our intent to expand our contingency funding\nsources and successfully executed that plan by increasing total borrowing capacity from all sources by approximately seven percent in\ncomparison to the prior fiscal year. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share in fiscal 2024 while repurchasing\napproximately 197,000 shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase plans. Our capital management activities resulted in an\napproximately 88 percent distribution of fiscal 2024 net income.\nFiscal 2025\nSimilar to fiscal 2024, we plan to emphasize measured growth in loans held for investment; the continued growth of retail deposits;\ndisciplined control of operating expenses where we continue to improve operating efficiencies; and sound capital management decisions. We\nbelieve this is reasonable in a less restrictive monetary policy environment, where elevated interest rates and the inverted yield curve begin\nto reverse course and normalize. We currently plan to return capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and believe that\nmaintaining our cash dividend is very important to shareholders. We also recognize that prudent capital returns through stock repurchase\nprograms is an essential capital management tool that we will continue to use as a component of our capital management strategy. We\nremain committed to single-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate mortgage lending as our primary sources of asset growth and\nwe will redeploy cash flows from investment securities to support the growth of our loan portfolio. Since we suspect that we are on the cusp\nof interest rate cuts by the FOMC, we believe there will be adjustments to the yield curve that will better support loan growth in the balance\nsheet at a lower cost of funds, and likely expansion in our net interest margin. This strategy is intended to improve core revenue, over time,\nthrough a higher net interest margin, higher net interest income and ultimately, coupled with the growth of the Company, an increase in net\nincome.\nA Final Word\nAs I think about the upcoming year framed by recent operating conditions, the word that comes to mind is resilience. The last few years\nhave seen the world recovering from a once in a lifetime pandemic, banking industry turmoil in terms of elevated liquidity, interest rate and\ncommercial real estate credit risks, and the highest rate of inflation in over 40 years. I would like to share a quote that I believe is apropos to\nour experience. “Everyone experiences tough times; it is a measure of your determination and dedication how you deal with them and how\nyou can come through them.” – Lakshmi Mittal (Executive Chairman for ArcelorMittal, the world’s second largest steelmaking company).\nAs we look to the next fiscal year, I want to assure you that we are determined and dedicated. We adjust our operating strategies on an\nongoing basis to overcome challenging conditions but not in a way that jeopardizes our long-term viability in\nexchange for short-term profitability. In this competitive environment, we understand we need to balance profitability against risks, but\nbelieve that moving further out on the risk curve within our core competencies is warranted at this time given our strong financial foundation\nand general outlook for improving operating conditions. But we will not move away from our community banking roots or from serving the\nfamilies and small businesses of the Inland Empire, moreover we will celebrate and continue to expand on that heritage.\nIn closing, I would like to recognize and thank our staff of banking professionals and Directors for their dedication to Provident. We\ncould not operate our business without their loyalty and dedication.\nI would also like to express my appreciation to our customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve. To all of you, thank you for\nyour continued patronage and support. We recognize that our continued success is inextricably linked to each of you and is dependent upon\nyour ongoing support.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Craig G. Blunden\nCraig G.

(the\n“Company”) has adopted this Policy to provide for the recovery of certain incentive compensation in the event\nof an Accounting Restatement (as defined below).\n1. Administration\nExcept as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the independent members\nof the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Administrator”). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and\nconstrue this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration\nof this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected\nindividuals and the Company and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the Policy.\nIn the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with Company\ncounsel, the full Board, or such other committees of the Board, such as the Company’s Audit Committee, as\nmay be necessary or appropriate.\nSubject to any limitation of applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer\nor employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and\nintent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or\nemployee).\n2. Definitions\nAs used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements\ndue to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities\nlaws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial\nstatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as “Big R”\nrestatements), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period\nor left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as “little r” restatements).\n“Administrator” has the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof.\n“Applicable Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of (i)\nthe date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such\naction if Board action is not required, concludes (or reasonably should have concluded) that an Accounting\nRestatement is required or (ii) the date a regulator, court or other legally authorized entity directs the Company\nto undertake an Accounting Restatement. The “Applicable Period” also includes any transition period that\nresults from a change in the Company’s fiscal year within or immediately following the three completed fiscal\nyears identified in the preceding sentence; except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least\nnine months shall count as a completed fiscal year.\n“Covered Executives” means the Company’s current and former executive officers, referred to as\nSenior Management by the Company, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the definition of\n“executive officer” set forth in Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” has the meaning set forth in Section 5 of this Policy.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with\nthe accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measure that is\nderived wholly or in part from such measure and includes “non-GAAP” measures for purposes of Regulation\nG promulgated under the Exchange Act. Financial Reporting Measures include but are not limited to the\nfollowing (and any measures derived from the following): Company stock price; total shareholder return\n(“TSR”); revenues; net income; operating income; operating net income, operating pre-tax pre-provision\nincome, tangible book value, tangible book value per share, profitability or growth of one or more reportable\nsegments; financial ratios (e.g., yield on loans, rates on deposits, efficiency ratio, nonperforming loans to total\nloans, nonperforming assets to total assets, loans to assets ratio, loans to deposits ratio); liquidity measures\n(e.g., capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., net interest margin, return on assets, return on\nequity); earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); any of such financial reporting measures relative to a\npeer group, where the Company’s financial reporting measure is subject to an Accounting Restatement; and tax\nbasis income. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements\nor included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based\nwholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is\n“received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting\nMeasure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of\nsuch Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. Examples of “Incentive-Based\nCompensation” include, but are not limited to: non-equity incentive plan awards that are earned based wholly\nor in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal; bonuses paid from a “bonus pool,”\nthe size of which is determined based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure\nperformance goal; other cash awards based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance\ngoal; restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards or units, stock options and stock\nappreciation rights that are granted or become vested based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial\nReporting Measure performance goal; and proceeds received upon the sale of shares acquired through an\nincentive plan that were granted or vested based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure\nperformance goal. Examples of compensation that is not “incentive-based compensation” include, but are not\nlimited to: salaries (except to the extent a salary increase is earned wholly or in part based on the attainment of\na Financial Reporting Measure performance goal); bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee or Board that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by\nsatisfying a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal; bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more\nsubjective standards (e.g., demonstrated leadership) and/or completion of a specified employment period; non-\nequity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic measures (e.g.,\nconsummating a merger or branch acquisition or divestiture), or operational measures (e.g., opening a\nspecified number of branches, completion of a project, increase in market share); and equity awards for which\nthe grant is not contingent upon achieving any Financial Reporting Measure performance goal and vesting is\ncontingent solely upon completion of a specified employment period and/or attaining one or more nonfinancial\nreporting measures.\n3. Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation\nThis Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive (a) after\nbeginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a Covered Executive at any time during\nthe performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class\nof securities on a national securities exchange. This Policy does not apply to Incentive-Based Compensation\nreceived by a Covered Executive (x) while that person was serving in a non-executive capacity prior to\nbecoming a Covered Executive or (y) who is a Covered Executive on the date on which\n2\nthe Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement but who was not a Covered Executive at any\ntime during the performance period for which the Incentive-Based Compensation is received.\n4. Required Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the Event of an Accounting\nRestatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall\npromptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive,\nas calculated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, relating to the Applicable Period.\n5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount of “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” subject to recovery under the Policy, as\ndetermined by the Administrator, is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered\nExecutive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been received by the\nCovered Executive had such compensation been determined based on the restated amounts.\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed by the Administrator without regard to any\ntaxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation. By way of\nexample, with respect to any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive-Based\nCompensation, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery hereunder includes, but\nis not limited to, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nand any earnings accrued to date on that notional amount.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine\nthe amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nAccounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was\nreceived; and (b) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate\nand provide such documentation to The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) and the Covered Executive.\n6. Method of Recoupment\nThe Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for reasonably\npromptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without limitation (a)\nseeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-\nbased awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned\nfuture cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with\nSection 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”), and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any\napplicable law, the Administrator may effect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to\nthe Covered Executive, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable\nCompany plan, program, or contract, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation\npreviously deferred by the Covered Executive.\nThe Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Board has\ndetermined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the\nfollowing procedural and disclosure requirements:\n● The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount\nto be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any\n3\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the\nAdministrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to\nNasdaq; or\n● Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are\nbroadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Sections\n401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the IRC and the regulations thereunder.\n7. No Additional Payments\nIn no event shall the Company be required to award Covered Executives an additional payment if the\nAccounting Restatement results in a higher Incentive-Based Compensation payment.\n8. No Indemnification or Reimbursement of Covered Executives\nNotwithstanding the terms of any other policy, program, agreement, or arrangement, in no event will\nthe Company or any of its affiliates indemnify or reimburse a Covered Executive for any loss under this Policy\nand in no event will the Company or any of its affiliates pay premiums or reimburse the Covered Executive for\npremiums he or she paid on any insurance policy that would cover a Covered Executive’s potential obligations\nwith respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy.\n9. Administrator Indemnification\nAny members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board or officers of the Company\nwho assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or\ninterpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest\nextent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination, or\ninterpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the\nBoard under applicable law or Company policy.\n10. Effective Date; Retroactive Application\nThis Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”). The terms of this Policy\nshall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the\nEffective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, or granted to Covered\nExecutives prior to the Effective Date. This Policy shall supersede and replace any existing policy regarding\ncompensation recovery previously approved by the Board.\n11. Acknowledgement by Covered Executives; Condition to Eligibility for Incentive-Based\nCompensation.\nThe Company will provide notice and seek acknowledgement of this Policy from each Covered\nExecutive in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, provided that the failure to provide such notice or obtain\nsuch acknowledgement will have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this Policy. After the\nEffective Date, the Company must be in receipt of a Covered Executive’s acknowledgement as a condition to\nsuch Covered Executive’s eligibility to receive Incentive-Based Compensation awarded or received after such\ndate. All Incentive-Based Compensation subject to this Policy will not be earned, even if already paid, until\nthe Policy ceases to apply to such Incentive-Based Compensation and any other vesting conditions applicable\nto such Incentive-Based Compensation are satisfied.\n4\n12. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend, modify, supplement, rescind or replace all or any portion of this Policy at any\ntime and from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with\napplicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed.\n13. Other Recoupment Rights; Company Claims\nThe Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any right of\nrecoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment\nthat may be available to the Company under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in\nany employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies\navailable to the Company.\nNothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as contemplated by this Policy, shall\nlimit any claims, damages, or other legal remedies the Company or any of its affiliates may have against a\nCovered Executive arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the Covered Executive.\n14. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries,\nheirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives.\n15. Exhibit Filing Requirement\nA copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto shall be posted on the Company’s website and filed\nas an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n5\nEXHIBIT A\nTO BE SIGNED BY THE COMPANY’S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS:\nCompensation Recovery Policy Acknowledgment\nThe undersigned agrees and acknowledges that I am fully bound by, and subject to, all of the terms and\nconditions of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. Compensation Recovery Policy (as it may be amended, restated,\nsupplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time.

In the event it is determined by the Administrator that any amounts granted, awarded, earned, or paid to me\nmust be forfeited or reimbursed to the Company, I will promptly take any action necessary to effectuate such\nforfeiture and/or reimbursement.

All\nsuch adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The condensed consolidated statement of financial condition at June 30,\n2024 is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the \"Bank\") (collectively, the \"Corporation\"). Certain information and note\ndisclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (\"GAAP\") have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities\nand Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") with respect to interim financial reporting. It is recommended that these unaudited\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto included in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (“2024\nAnnual Form 10-K”). The results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of\nresults that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\nNote 2: Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”)\nASU 2023-09:\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public business entities to annually (a) disclose specific\ncategories in the rate reconciliation and (b) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative\nthreshold of equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the\napplicable statutory income tax rate. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the\nimpact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-07:\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments include: (a) introduce a new requirement to disclose\nsignificant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), (b) extend certain annual\ndisclosures to interim periods, (c) clarify single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, (d) permit\nmore than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and (e) require disclosure of the title\nand position of the CODM. This ASU is effective for public entities fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is in the\nprocess of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 3: Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by\nthe weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.

At September 30, 2024, most of the $11.4 million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12\nmonths or more, except $1,000 of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for less than 12 months; while at June 30,\n2024, all $15.8 million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses on\ninvestment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased\nand not due to the credit quality of the investment securities, which are predominately U.S. government sponsored enterprise\nsecurities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses.\nTherefore, the Corporation has determined that the unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating nature of interest rates, and not\nrelated to any potential credit risks within the investment portfolio. The Bank does not currently intend to sell any investment\nsecurities classified as held to maturity recorded at amortized cost or available for sale recorded at fair market value as\nprescribed by GAAP. As a part of the Corporation’s monthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed\nliquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment securities\nbefore the recovery of its amortized cost basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Corporation’s assessment that the\nCorporation has the ability to hold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery\nof the amortized cost is realized and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities\nprior to recovery of the amortized cost. There was no allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on or impairment of investment\nsecurities held to maturity and there was no impairment of investment securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 and\nJune 30, 2024.\nIn order to maintain adequate liquidity, the Bank has established borrowing facilities with various counterparties. The Bank\nhad a remaining borrowing capacity of $249.2 million as of September 30, 2024 at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition,\nthe Bank has secured an estimated $211.5 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by\ninvestment securities totaling $120.8 million and loans held for investment totaling $174.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank also has an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with\nits correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under the Federal Reserve discount window or\ncorrespondent bank facility as of September 30, 2024. The total remaining available borrowing capacity across all sources\ntotaled approximately $510.7 million at September 30, 2024.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of $261.3 million at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition,\nthe Bank had secured an estimated $208.6 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by\ninvestment securities totaling $126.6 million and loans held for investment totaling $178.6 million at June 30, 2024. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the Bank also had an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds\n9\nTable of Contents\nfacility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million.

The total remaining available borrowing capacity across all sources\ntotaled approximately $519.9 million at June 30, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment\nsecurities available for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until\nmaturity. It also determined that it was more likely than not that the Corporation would not be required to sell the securities\nprior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nContractual maturities of investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nEstimated Estimated\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(In Thousands) Cost Value Cost Value\nHeld to maturity\nDue in one year or less $ 355 $ 352 $ 349 $ 343\nDue after one through five years 3,710 3,628 4,328 4,167\nDue after five through ten years 46,492 43,415 49,331 44,830\nDue after ten years 73,711 65,574 76,043 65,053\nTotal investment securities - held to maturity 124,268 112,969 130,051 114,393\nAvailable for sale\nDue in one year or less — — — —\nDue after one through five years — — — —\nDue after five through ten years 1,386 1,399 1,055 1,053\nDue after ten years 409 410 806 796\nTotal investment securities - available for sale 1,795 1,809 1,861 1,849\nTotal investment securities $ 126,063 $ 114,778 $ 131,912 $ 116,242\nNote 5: Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment, net of fair value adjustments, consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2024\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 524,235 $ 518,091\nMulti-family 435,782 445,182\nCommercial real estate 81,169 83,349\nConstruction 2,816 2,692\nOther 92 95\nCommercial business loans 1,510 1,372\nConsumer loans 63 65\nTotal loans held for investment, gross 1,045,667 1,050,846\nAdvance payments of escrows 127 102\nDeferred loan costs, net 9,168 9,096\nACL on loans (6,329) (7,065)\nTotal loans held for investment, net $ 1,048,633 $ 1,052,979\nThe following table sets forth information at September 30, 2024 regarding the dollar amount of loans held for investment that\nare contractually repricing during the periods indicated, segregated between adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, fixed rate loans comprised 11 percent and 10 percent of loans held for investment,\nrespectively.

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly\nreview of the adequacy of the ACL. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for\ncredit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.\nThe two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are\nindividually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. The collectively evaluated allowance is based on a\npooling method for groups of homogeneous loans sharing similar loan characteristics to calculate an allowance which reflects\nan estimate of lifetime expected credit losses using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Loans identified to be individually evaluated have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the\ncollateral, less selling costs or discounted cash flow with an appropriate default factor.\nThe Corporation categorizes all loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability\nof the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit\ndocumentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. A description of the general\ncharacteristics of the risk grades is as follows:\n● Pass – A pass loan ranges from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The likelihood of loss\nis considered remote.\n● Special Mention - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected,\nmay result in a loss. While concerns exist, the Corporation is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and\nnot imminent.\n● Substandard - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the\nborrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or\n13\nTable of Contents\nweaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct\npossibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n● Doubtful - A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts,\nconditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n● Loss - A loss loan is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Corporation\nis not warranted.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the Corporation’s recorded investment in loans by risk categories and gross charge-offs by year\nof origination as of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024 Term Loans by Year of Origination Revolving\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Total\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nPass $ 41,843 $ 57,053 $ 203,838 $ 146,983 $ 17,315 $ 55,137 $ 11 $ 522,180\nSpecial Mention -

The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past\nevents, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the\ncollectability of the reported amount. The Corporation’s ACL is calculated quarterly, with changes in the ACL recorded\nthrough an entry to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses. Management calculates the quantitative portion of the\ncollectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an average charge-off or loss rate methodology and generally\nevaluates collectively evaluated loans by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency’s Call Report code in order to group and\ndetermine portfolio loan segments with similar risk characteristics. The Corporation primarily utilizes historical loss rates for\nthe CECL calculation based on its own specific historical losses and/or with peer loss history where applicable.\nThe expected loss rates are applied to expected monthly loan balances estimated through the consideration of contractual\nrepayment terms and expected prepayments. The prepayment assumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual\nlife of the loans are estimated based on historical and bank-specific experience and the consideration of current and expected\nconditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptions may be updated by\nmanagement in the event that changing conditions impact management’s estimate or additional historical data gathered has\nresulted in the need for a reevaluation.\nFor its reasonable and supportable forecasting of current expected credit losses, the Corporation utilizes a regression model\nusing forecasted economic metrics and historical loss data. The regression model utilized relies upon reasonable and\nsupportable 12-month forecasts of the National Unemployment Rate and change in the Real Gross Domestic Product, after\nwhich it reverts to a historical loss rate. Management selected the National Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic\nProduct as the drivers of the forward look component of the collectively evaluated allowance, primarily as a result of high\ncorrelation coefficients identified in regression modeling, the availability of forecasts, including the quarterly Federal Open\nMarket Committee forecast, and the widespread familiarity of these economic metrics.\nManagement recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in\nthe quantitative portion of the allowance on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditions may vary\ncompared with conditions over the historical lookback period, which is utilized in the calculation of the quantitative\nallowance, management considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loans may be\nwarranted, given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. The following qualitative factors (“Q-factors”) are\nconsidered by management and reflect the regulatory guidance on the Q-factors:\n● Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.\n● Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.\n● The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n● Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that\naffect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.\n● The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of\nestimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio.\n● Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-performing loans, and the volume and\nseverity of adversely classified or graded loans.\n● Changes in the quality of the Corporation’s loan review system.\n● Changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans in the portfolio.\n● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off,\nand recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.\nThe qualitative portion of the Corporation’s allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using management\njudgment, to determine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative allowance is\nalso contingent upon the relative weighting of the Q-factors according to management’s judgment.\nLoans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that\nforeclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair\nvalue of collateral at the reporting date, less selling costs.\n17\nTable of Contents\nAccrued interest receivable for loans is included in accrued interest receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition. The Corporation elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected\nto reverse accrued interest income on loans that are placed on non-performing status. A loan is deemed non-performing when\nit is 90 days or more delinquent. The Corporation believes this policy results in the timely reversal of potentially uncollectible\ninterest.\nPursuant to ASU 2022-02, “Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,” the Corporation may agree to different\ntypes of modifications, including principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extension, significant payment delay or\nany combination of modifications noted above. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no loan\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses\non the Corporation’s loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly\nbasis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of\noperations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions\nbeyond the Corporation’s control.\nNon-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed\nuncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days\ndelinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were previously modified\nfrom their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified as modified loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes\n90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent.\nThe amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the ACL. For\nmodified loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the ACL is segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for\nthose loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their modification period, classified lower than pass, and\ncontaining an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method.\nFor non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated\nallowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an\nindividually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for modified loans) or\ncollateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required.\nA non-performing loan can be restored to accrual status when a borrower is current in payments for six consecutive months.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe following table discloses additional details for the periods indicated on the Corporation’s ACL on loans held for\ninvestment:\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023\nACL, beginning of period $ 7,065 $ 5,946\nImpact of ASC 326 CECL adoption(1) — 1,197\n(Recovery of) provision for credit losses (736) 536\nTotal recoveries — —\nTotal charge-offs — —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) — —\nACL, end of period $ 6,329 $ 7,679\nACL on loans as a percentage of gross loans held for investment 0.61 % 0.72 %\nNet (recoveries) charge-offs as a percentage of average loans receivable, net, during the\nperiod (annualized) — % — %\nACL on loans as a percentage of gross non-performing loans at the end of the period 297.00 % 545.38 %\n(1) Represents the impact of adopting ASC 326 on July 1, 2023.

Generally, a loan is placed on non-performing status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or\ninterest or after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower’s financial condition\nis such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not\nrecognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan\nmay be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current, the borrower(s) has\ndemonstrated sustained payment performance and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected\non a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance have been (a) collectively evaluated using a pooling method analysis or (b)\nindividually evaluated using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less\ncosts to sell, to establish realizable value. This analysis may identify a specific allowance amount needed or may conclude that\nno allowance is needed.\nAt September 30, 2024\nUnpaid Net\nPrincipal Related Recorded Recorded\n(In Thousands) Balance Charge-offs Investment ACL(1) Investment\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nWith a related allowance $ 1,399 $ — $ 1,399 $ (25) $ 1,374\nWithout a related allowance(2) 757 (25) 732 — 732\nTotal single-family loans 2,156 (25) 2,131 (25) 2,106\nTotal non-performing loans $ 2,156 $ (25) $ 2,131 $ (25) $ 2,106\n(1) ACL, specifically assigned to the individual loan.\n(2) There was no related ACL because the loans were charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral was\nhigher than the loan balance.\nAt June 30, 2024\nUnpaid Related Net\nPrincipal Charge-offs Recorded Recorded\n(In Thousands) Balance Related Investment ACL(1) Investment\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family:\nWith a related allowance $ 2,267 $ — $ 2,267 $ (73) $ 2,194\nWithout a related allowance(2) 427 (25) 402 — 402\nTotal single-family loans 2,694 (25) 2,669 (73) 2,596\nTotal non-performing loans $ 2,694 $ (25) $ 2,669 $ (73) $ 2,596\n(1) ACL, specifically assigned to the individual loan.\n(2) There was no related ACL because the loans were charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral was\nhigher than the loan balance.\nAt September 30, 2024, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to those borrowers whose loans were classified\nas non-performing.\nFor the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s average recorded investment in non-performing loans\nwas $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The Corporation records payments on non-performing loans utilizing the cash\nbasis or cost recovery method of accounting during the periods when the loans are on non-performing status. For the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, the Bank received $39,000 in interest payments from non-performing loans, of which all $39,000\nwas recognized as interest income and none was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method. In\ncomparison, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Bank received $18,000 in interest payments from non-performing\nloans, of which all $18,000 was recognized as interest income and none was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost\nrecovery method.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the average recorded investment in non-performing loans and the related interest income\nrecognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage Interest Average Interest\nRecorded Income Recorded Income\n(In Thousands) Investment Recognized Investment Recognized\nWithout related ACL:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 843 $ 5 $ 250 $ —\n843 5 250 —\nWith related ACL:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family 1,582 34 1,163 18\n1,582 34 1,163 18\nTotal $ 2,425 $ 39 $ 1,413 $ 18\nDuring the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no properties were acquired in the settlement of loans and no\npreviously foreclosed upon properties were sold. A new appraisal is obtained on each of the properties at the time of\nforeclosure and fair value is derived by using the lower of the appraised value or the listing price of the property, net of selling\ncosts. Any initial loss upon repossession is recorded as a charge to the ACL before being transferred to real estate owned.\nSubsequent to transfer to real estate owned, if there is further deterioration in real estate values, specific real estate owned loss\nreserves are established and charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, the Corporation\nrecords costs to carry real estate owned as real estate owned operating expenses as incurred. As of both September 30, 2024\nand June 30, 2024, there was no real estate owned property.\nThe Bank adjusts the reserve for unfunded loan commitments through the provision for (recovery of) credit losses.\nThe following table provides information regarding the unfunded loan commitment reserve for the quarters ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of the period $ 57 $ 42\nProvision for credit losses 39 9\nBalance, end of the period $ 96 $ 51\nThe method for calculating the unfunded commitment reserve is based on a historical funding rate applied to the undisbursed\nloan amount to estimate an average outstanding amount during the life of the loan commitment. The Corporation applies the\nsame assumptions and methodologies by loan groupings to these unfunded loan commitments as it does for its funded loans\nheld for investment to determine the reserve rate and the allowance. Assumptions are evaluated by management periodically\nas part of the CECL procedures. The unfunded loan commitment reserve is recorded in Accounts payable, accrued interest and\nother liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nNote 6: Derivative and Other Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risks\nThe Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating\nloans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale commitments to third parties and option contracts. These\ninstruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount\n23\nTable of Contents\nrecognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation’s exposure to\ncredit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the\ncontractual amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments\nwith off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment of $15.3 million and $9.4 million,\nrespectively.\nThe following table provides information regarding unfunded loan commitments, which are comprised of undisbursed funds\non construction loans, undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of credit with the Corporation and commitments to\noriginate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below.\nCommitments September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\n(In Thousands)\nUndisbursed loan funds – Construction loans $ 311 $ 435\nUndisbursed lines of credit – Mortgage loans 270 —\nUndisbursed lines of credit – Commercial business loans 2,889 2,936\nUndisbursed lines of credit – Consumer loans 337 341\nCommitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment 15,252 9,387\nTotal $ 19,059 $ 13,099\nIn accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and interpretations of the Derivatives Implementation Group of the\nFASB, the fair value of the commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, loan sale commitments, to be announced\n(“TBA”) MBS trades, put option contracts and call option contracts are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition. The Corporation does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments;\ntherefore, all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were no\noutstanding derivative financial instruments.\nLoans previously sold to the FHLB – San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program have a\nrecourse liability. The FHLB – San Francisco absorbs the first four basis points of loss by establishing a first loss account and\na credit scoring process is used to calculate the maximum recourse amount for the Bank. All losses above the Bank’s\nmaximum recourse amount are the responsibility of the FHLB – San Francisco. The FHLB – San Francisco pays the Bank a\ncredit enhancement fee monthly to compensate the Bank for accepting the recourse obligation. As of September 30, 2024 and\nJune 30, 2024, the Bank serviced $3.0 million and $3.1 million of loans under this program, respectively, and has established a\nrecourse liability of $7,000 and $8,000, respectively.\nOccasionally, the Bank is required to repurchase loans sold to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or other investors if it is determined\nthat such loans do not meet the credit requirements of the investor, or if one of the parties involved in the loan misrepresented\npertinent facts, committed fraud, or if such loans were 90-days past due within 120 days of the loan funding date. During the\nquarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank did not repurchase any loans or settle any request to repurchase a loan.\nIn addition to the specific recourse liability for the MPF program, the Bank established a recourse liability of $16,000 and\n$18,000 for loans sold to other investors at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe following table shows the summary of the recourse liability for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\nRecourse Liability 2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nBalance, beginning of the period $ 26 $ 33\n(Recovery) provision for recourse liability (3) —\nNet settlements in lieu of loan repurchases — —\nBalance, end of the period $ 23 $ 33\n24\nTable of Contents\nNote 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Corporation adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” and elected the fair value option pursuant to\nASC 825, “Financial Instruments.” ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands\ndisclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 825 permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and\ncertain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the “Fair Value Option”) at specified\nelection dates. The Corporation elected the fair value option on loans held for investment which were previously originated for\nsale. At each subsequent reporting date, an entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items in earnings for\nwhich the fair value option has been elected. The objective of the Fair Value Option is to improve financial reporting by\nproviding entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and\nliabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.\nThe following table describes the difference at the dates indicated between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans held for investment at fair value:\nAggregate\nUnpaid Net\nAggregate Principal Unrealized\n(In Thousands) Fair Value Balance Loss\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nLoans held for investment, at fair value $ 1,082 $ 1,190 $ (108)\nAs of June 30, 2024:\nLoans held for investment, at fair value $ 1,047 $ 1,200 $ (153)\nASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value\ncalculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability\nto access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or\nliability. Valuation techniques may include the use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks.\nThese unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation’s estimate of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted\ncash flow models and similar techniques.\nASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a\nfinancial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the\nlowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation.\nThe Corporation’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities\navailable for sale, loans held for investment at fair value, other equity investments and interest-only strips; while loans with\nindividually evaluated allowances and mortgage servicing assets (“MSA”) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nInvestment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government\nsponsored enterprise MBS and private issue CMO. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar\nsecurities for its fair value measurement of MBS (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active\nmarkets for its fair value measurement of the private issue CMO (Level 3).\n25\nTable of Contents\nLoans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale.\nThe fair value is determined by management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan, in addition to the\nquoted secondary-market prices which account for the interest rate characteristics of each loan (Level 3).\nLoans with an individually evaluated allowance that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are loans which are\ninadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower(s) or of the collateral pledged. These\nloans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected. The fair value of a loan with an individually evaluated allowance is determined based on the discounted cash flow\nor current appraised value of the underlying collateral. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on\nmanagement’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management’s expertise\nand knowledge of the collateral. For commercial real estate loans with an individually evaluated allowance, the fair value is\nderived from the appraised value of its collateral. Loans with an individually evaluated allowance are reviewed and evaluated\non at least a quarterly basis for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above\n(Level 3). This loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), but\nrather as a component in determining the overall adequacy of the ACL. These adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans\nwith an individually evaluated allowance may result in increases or decreases to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses\nrecorded in current earnings.\nThe fair value of other equity investments is derived from quoted prices in active markets for the equivalent or similar\ninvestments (Level 2).\nThe Corporation uses the amortization method for its MSA, which amortizes the MSA in proportion to the current MSA\nbalance to the original MSA balance and assesses the MSA for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair\nvalue of the MSA is derived using the present value method; which includes a third party’s prepayment projections of similar\ninstruments, weighted average coupon rates, estimated servicing costs and discount interest rates (Level 3).\nThe fair value of interest-only strips is derived using the same assumptions that are used to value the related MSA (Level 3).\nThe Corporation’s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable\nvalue or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporation’s valuation methodologies are\nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the\nfair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe following fair value hierarchy tables present information at the dates indicated about the Corporation’s assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurement at September 30, 2024 Using:\n(In Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestment securities -

A decrease to the unobservable input would have\nthe opposite effect. Significant changes in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value\nmeasurements.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities include the\nfollowing: prepayment speeds, discount rates and broker quotes, among others. Significant increases or decreases in any of\nthese inputs in isolation could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The various unobservable inputs\nused to determine valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation.\nThe carrying amount and fair value of the Corporation’s other financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024 was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCarrying Fair\n(In Thousands) Amount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair\nvalue $ 1,047,551 $ 1,000,376 $ — $ — $ 1,000,376\nInvestment securities - held to maturity $ 124,268 $ 112,969 $ — $ 112,969 $ —\nFHLB – San Francisco stock $ 9,568 $ 9,568 $ — $ 9,568 $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 863,864 $ 864,774 $ — $ 864,774 $ —\nBorrowings $ 249,500 $ 250,401 $ — $ 250,401 $ —\n29\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2024\nCarrying Fair\n(In Thousands) Amount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair value $ 1,051,932 $ 973,453 $ — $ — $ 973,453\nInvestment securities - held to maturity $ 130,051 $ 114,393 $ — $ 114,393 $ —\nFHLB – San Francisco stock $ 9,568 $ 9,568 $ — $ 9,568 $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 888,348 $ 888,527 $ — $ 888,527 $ —\nBorrowings $ 238,500 $ 237,691 $ — $ 237,691 $ —\nLoans held for investment, not recorded at fair value: For loans that reprice frequently at market rates, the carrying amount\napproximates the fair value. For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future\ncash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which similar\nloans would be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices.\nInvestment securities - held to maturity: The investment securities - held to maturity consist of U.S. SBA securities, U.S.\ngovernment sponsored enterprise MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO. For the U.S. SBA securities and U.S.\ngovernment sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar\nsecurities for its fair value measurement.\nFHLB – San Francisco stock: The carrying amount reported for FHLB – San Francisco stock approximates fair value. When\nredeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock.\nDeposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based\nupon observable inputs, including rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of\ntransaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand.\nBorrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on\nsuch borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.\nThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation\ngenerally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily\nutilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The\nCorporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the\nvaluation process.\nWhile the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of\ndifferent methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, there were no significant changes to the\nCorporation’s valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations.\nNote 8: Revenue From Contracts With Customers\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to the customer in exchange for\nthe consideration the Corporation expects to be entitled to receive. The largest portion of the Corporation's revenue is from\ninterest income, which is not in the scope of ASC 606. All of the Corporation's revenue from contracts with customers in the\nscope of ASC 606 is recognized in non-interest income.\nIf a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Corporation recognizes revenue as it satisfies a performance\nobligation. Payments from customers are generally collected at the time services are rendered, monthly, quarterly or annually.\nFor contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is either earned at a point in\n30\nTable of Contents\ntime or revenue is earned over time. Examples of revenue earned at a point in time are automated teller machine (\"ATM\")\ntransaction fees, wire transfer fees, overdraft fees and interchange fees. Revenue is primarily based on the number and type of\ntransactions that are generally derived from transactional information accumulated by our systems and is recognized\nimmediately as the transactions occur or upon providing the service to complete the customer's transaction. The Corporation is\ngenerally the principal in these contracts, except for interchange fees, in which case the Corporation is acting as the agent and\nrecords revenue net of expenses paid to the principal. Examples of revenue earned over time, which generally occur monthly,\nare deposit account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, merchant revenue, trust and investment management fees and\nsafe deposit box fees. Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by our systems or those of\nthird-parties and is recognized as the related transactions occur or services are rendered to the customer.\nDisaggregation of Revenue:\nThe following table includes the Corporation's non-interest income disaggregated by type of services for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\nType of Services 2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nLoan servicing and other fees(1) $ 104 $ (21)\nDeposit account fees 298 288\nCard and processing fees 320 353\nOther(2) 177 131\nTotal non-interest income $ 899 $ 751\n(1) Not within the scope of ASC 606.\n(2) Includes net BOLI income of $46 thousand and $46 thousand, net loss on sale of loans of $21 thousand and $0, and net\nunrealized gain on other equity investments of $25 thousand and $0 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nwhich are not within the scope of ASC 606.\nFor both the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Corporation's revenues within the scope of\nASC 606 are for performance obligations satisfied at a specified date.\nRevenues recognized within the scope of ASC 606:\nDeposit account fees: Fees are earned on the Bank's deposit accounts for various products offered to, or services performed\nfor, the Bank's customers. Fees include business account fees, non-sufficient fund fees, ATM fees and other fees. These fees\nare recognized concurrent with the event on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of service.\nCard and processing fees: Debit interchange income represents fees earned when a debit card issued by the Bank is used.\nThe Bank earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions through a third-party payment network. Interchange fees from\ncardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with\nthe transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are earned\nwhen the merchant transaction is charged to the cardholders’ debit card. Certain expenses directly associated with the debit\ncards are recorded on a net basis with the interchange income.\nOther fees: Includes asset management fees, stop payment fees, wire services fees, safe deposit box fees and fees earned on\nother services, such as merchant services or occasional non-recurring type services, and are recognized at the time of the event\nor the applicable billing cycle. Asset management fees are variable, since they are based on the underlying portfolio value,\nwhich is subject to market conditions and amounts invested by customers through a third-party provider. Asset management\nfees are recognized over the period that services are provided, when the portfolio values are known or can be estimated at the\nend of each month. These fees are recognized concurrent with the event on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis,\ndepending on the type of service.\n31\nTable of Contents\nNote 9: Leases\nThe Corporation accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842 which requires the Corporation to record liabilities for\nfuture lease obligations as well as assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets. The Corporation's leases\nprimarily represent future obligations to make payments for the use of buildings, space or equipment for its operations.\nLiabilities to make future lease payments are recorded in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities, while right-\nof-use assets are recorded in premises and equipment in the Corporation's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. At September 30, 2024, all of the Corporation's leases were classified as operating leases and the Corporation did\nnot have any operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (\"short-term leases\"). Liabilities to make future lease\npayments and right-of-use assets are recorded for operating leases and do not include short-term leases. These liabilities and\nright-of-use assets are determined based on the total contractual base rents for each lease, which include options to extend or\nrenew each lease, where applicable, and where the Corporation believes it has an economic incentive to extend or renew the\nlease. Since lease extensions are not reasonably certain, the Corporation generally does not recognize payments occurring\nduring option periods in the calculation of its operating right-of-use lease assets and operating lease liabilities. The\nCorporation utilizes the FHLB – San Francisco rates as a discount rate for each of the remaining contractual terms at the\nadoption date as well as for future leases if the discount rate is not stated in the lease. For leases that contain variable lease\npayments, the Corporation assumes future lease payment escalations based on a lease payment escalation rate specified in the\nlease or the specified index rate observed at the time of lease commencement. Liabilities to make future lease payments are\naccounted for using the interest method, being reduced by periodic contractual lease payments net of periodic interest\naccretion. Right-of-use assets for operating leases are amortized over the term of the associated lease by amounts that\nrepresent the difference between periodic straight-line lease expense and periodic interest accretion in the related liability to\nmake future lease payments.\nFor the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, expenses associated with the Corporation’s leases totaled $217,000 and\n$247,000, respectively. Expenses associated with the Corporation’s leases are recorded in either premises and occupancy or\nequipment, as applicable, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following tables present supplemental information related to operating leases at the date and for the periods indicated:\nAs of\n(In Thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Condition:\nPremises and equipment - Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 1,697 $ 1,356\nAccounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities – Operating lease liabilities $ 1,747 $ 1,407\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nPremises and occupancy expenses from operating leases(1) $ 182 $ 213\nEquipment expenses from operating leases 35 34\nTotal lease expense $ 217 $ 247\n(1) Includes immaterial variable lease costs.\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended\n(In Thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases, net $ 213 $ 231\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information related to remaining minimum contractual lease payments and other information\nassociated with the Corporation’s leases as of September 30, 2024:\nAmount(1)\nFiscal Year Ending June 30, (In Thousands)\nRemainder of fiscal 2025 $ 536\nFiscal 2026 538\nFiscal 2027 347\nFiscal 2028 291\nFiscal 2029 141\nThereafter 11\nTotal contract lease payments $ 1,864\nTotal liability to make lease payments $ 1,747\nDifference in undiscounted and discounted future lease payments $ 117\nWeighted average discount rate 3.47 %\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 3.3\n(1) Contractual base rents do not include property taxes and other operating expenses due under respective lease agreements.\nNote 10: Stock Repurchases\nOn September 28, 2023, the Corporation’s Board of Directors announced a stock repurchase plan, authorizing the purchase of\nup to 350,353 shares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock over a one-year period. On September 26, 2024, the\nBoard extended the existing stock repurchase plan, which had 99,968 shares remaining available for purchase as of that date,\nuntil September 26, 2025 or until completion, whichever occurs first.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation purchased 93,641 shares of its common stock under the\nexisting stock repurchase plan with a weighted average cost of $14.26 per share. As of September 30, 2024, 95,475 shares or\n27 percent of authorized common stock under the existing plan remain available for purchase.\nNote 11: Subsequent Events\nOn October 24, 2024, the Corporation announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per\nshare. Shareholders of the Corporation’s common stock at the close of business on November 14, 2024 are entitled to receive\nthe cash dividend. The cash dividend will be payable on December 5, 2024.\nITEM 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nProvident Financial Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the\nholding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the “Bank\") upon the Bank’s conversion from a federal mutual to a\nfederal stock savings bank (“Conversion”). The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996. The Corporation is regulated by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had total\nassets of $1.26 billion, total deposits of $863.9 million and total stockholders’ equity of $129.6 million. The Corporation has\nnot engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this\nreport, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries. As used in this report,\nthe terms “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Corporation” refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries,\nunless the context indicates otherwise.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is\nregulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank’s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits\nby the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the FHLB System since 1956.\nThe Corporation operates in a single business segment through the Bank. The Bank’s activities include attracting deposits,\noffering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction\nand, to a lesser extent, other mortgage, commercial business and consumer loans. Deposits are collected primarily from 13\nbanking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. Loans are primarily originated and\npurchased in California. There are various risks inherent in the Corporation’s business including, among others, the general\nbusiness environment, interest rates, the California real estate market, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the\nrepurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary market conditions to buy and sell loans, competitive\nconditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks.\nThe Corporation began paying quarterly cash dividends during the quarter ended September 30, 2002. On July 25, 2024, the\nCorporation’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share for the Corporation’s shareholders of\nrecord at the close of business on August 15, 2024, which was paid on September 5, 2024.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Corporation’s critical accounting estimates are described in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2024 Annual Form 10-K. The\nCorporation adopted the current expected credit loss, or CECL, methodology on July 1, 2023. Accounting for the allowance\nfor credit losses (“ACL”) involves significant judgement and assumptions by management and is based on historical data,\ncurrent economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future events. On a quarterly basis, management\nreviews the methodology and adequacy of the ACL. Refer to Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and the “Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses” section in this Form 10-Q for more\ninformation on the establishment of the ACL.\n35\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary and Operating Strategy\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and\nsmall to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations\nas Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily\nthrough the Bank, consist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee\nservices on behalf of the Bank.\nCommunity banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding\nthe Corporation’s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans.\nAlso, to a lesser extent, the Corporation makes construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The\nprimary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income\nearned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds.\nAdditionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM\nfees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others.\nThe Corporation plans to enhance its community banking business by moderately increasing its total assets, focusing on\nexpanding single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, and commercial business loans. Additionally, the\nCorporation aims to reduce the percentage of retail time deposits in its deposit base while increasing the proportion of lower-\ncost checking and savings accounts. To diversify its deposit instruments, the Corporation will consider utilizing brokered\ncertificates of deposit and the State of California’s time deposits, subject to market conditions and its funding needs. This\nstrategy is designed to improve core revenue by achieving a higher net interest margin and, combined with the Corporation’s\ngrowth, ultimately increase net interest income. While the Corporation’s long-term strategy targets moderate growth,\nmanagement acknowledges that this growth may be influenced by general economic conditions and other factors.\nInvestment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds\nto the Bank’s depositors. Provident Financial Corp (“PFC”) performs trustee services for the Bank’s real estate secured loan\ntransactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment. Investment services and trustee\nservices contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue.\nThere are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the\nCorporation’s control as described in the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation attempts to\nmitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk\nmanagement, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. The California economic environment presents\nheightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Since the majority of\nthe Corporation’s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the value of California real\nestate may also inhibit the Corporation’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate. The\ncommercial real estate environment, particularly office space of various types, currently presents elevated risk within the\nbanking industry. In response, the Bank has reviewed its existing loans collateralized by office space for any outsized\nexposure and implemented tighter underwriting standards for this collateral type. At September 30, 2024, our commercial real\nestate portfolio totaled $81.2 million, including office space of various types, totaling approximately $41.3 million or 50.9\npercent of the total commercial real estate portfolio and 3.9 percent of the total loan portfolio.\nCommitments and Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, in the form of originating\nloans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale agreements to third parties and option contracts. These\ninstruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the\naccompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss, in the\nevent of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these\ninstruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-\n36\nTable of Contents\nbalance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. For a discussion on commitments and derivative financial\ninstruments, see Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024\nTotal assets decreased one percent to $1.26 billion at September 30, 2024 from $1.27 billion at June 30, 2024. The decrease\nwas primarily attributable to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans held for investment.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the FRB of San Francisco, decreased $3.2 million, or\nsix percent, to $48.2 million at September 30, 2024 from $51.4 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in total cash and cash\nequivalents was primarily attributable to deposit outflows and management’s proactive strategy to manage liquidity based\nupon recent economic conditions.\nInvestment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased $5.8 million, or four percent, to $126.1 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $131.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated\nprincipal payments on mortgage-backed and other securities during the first three months of fiscal 2025, with no purchases of\ninvestment securities during the period. For further analysis on investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to Unaudited\nInterim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.\nLoans held for investment decreased $4.3 million, less than one percent, to $1.05 billion at September 30, 2024 from $1.05\nbillion at June 30, 2024, predominantly due to declines in multi-family and commercial real estate loans, partly offset by an\nincrease in single-family loans. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, the Corporation originated $28.9 million of loans\nheld for investment, consisting primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans located throughout\nCalifornia. The Corporation did not purchase any loans during the first three months of fiscal 2025. Total loan principal\npayments during the first three months of fiscal 2025 were $34.0 million, up 48 percent from $23.0 million during the\ncomparable period in fiscal 2024. Single-family loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled\n$524.2 million and $518.1 million, representing approximately 50 percent and 49 percent of loans held for investment,\nrespectively. Multi-family loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled $435.8 million and\n$445.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 42 percent of loans held for investment at both dates. Commercial\nreal estate loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled $81.2 million and $83.3 million,\nrespectively, representing approximately eight percent of loans held for investment at both dates.\nThe tables below describe the geographic dispersion of gross real estate secured loans held for investment at September 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2024, as a percentage of the total dollar amount of loans outstanding:\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nInland Southern Other Other\nEmpire(1) California(2) California States Total\nLoan Category Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent\nSingle-family $ 146,388 28 % $ 173,247 33 % $ 204,348 39 % $ 252 — % $ 524,235 100 %\nMulti-family 53,738 12 % 254,445 59 % 127,599 29 % — — % 435,782 100 %\nCommercial real\nestate 13,600 17 % 43,853 54 % 23,716 29 % — — % 81,169 100 %\nConstruction 236 8 % 1,480 53 % 1,100 39 % — — % 2,816 100 %\nOther — — % 92 100 % — — % — — % 92 100 %\nTotal $ 213,962 21 % $ 473,117 45 % $ 356,763 34 % $ 252 — % $ 1,044,094 100 %\n(1) Comprised of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n(2) Other than the Inland Empire.\n37\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024:\nInland Southern Other Other\nEmpire(1) California(2) California States Total\nLoan Category Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent\nSingle-family $ 146,003 29 % $ 175,127 34 % $ 196,707 37 % $ 254 — % $ 518,091 100 %\nMulti-family 56,693 13 % 256,692 59 % 131,797 28 % — — % 445,182 100 %\nCommercial real\nestate 13,583 18 % 44,574 54 % 25,192 28 % — — % 83,349 100 %\nConstruction 228 30 % 1,480 58 % 984 12 % — — % 2,692 100 %\nOther — — % 95 100 % — — % — — % 95 100 %\nTotal $ 216,507 23 % $ 477,968 46 % $ 354,680 31 % $ 254 — % $ 1,049,409 100 %\n(1) Comprised of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n(2) Other than the Inland Empire.\nFor further analysis on loans held for investment, see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of this Form 10-Q.\nTotal deposits decreased $24.4 million, or three percent, to $863.9 million at September 30, 2024 from $888.3 million at June\n30, 2024, due to decreases in all account categories, except money market accounts. The decrease in total deposits was\nprimarily due to customers seeking higher interest rates as competition for deposits in our market area remains strong. Total\nuninsured deposits were approximately $124.2 million and $122.7 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,\nrespectively. The amounts of uninsured deposits are based on estimated amounts of uninsured deposits as of the reported\nperiod. Such estimates are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements.\nTransaction account balances or “core deposits” decreased $14.8 million, or two percent, to $599.7 million at September 30,\n2024 from $614.5 million at June 30, 2024, while time deposits decreased $9.7 million, or four percent, to $264.2 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $273.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in time deposits was due to primarily the decline in\nretail time deposits. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, total brokered certificates of deposit were $129.8 million and\n$131.8 million, respectively. Excluding brokered certificates of deposit, the percentage of time deposits to total deposits was\n18 percent and 19 percent at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nTotal borrowings increased $11.0 million, or five percent, to $249.5.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $238.5 million at\nJune 30, 2024. The increase in borrowings was primarily to augment the decrease in total deposits. At September 30, 2024 and\nJune 30, 2024, borrowings were comprised of short-term and long-term FHLB - San Francisco advances used for liquidity and\ninterest rate risk management purposes.\nTotal stockholders’ equity declined slightly to $129.6 million at September 30, 2024 from $129.9 million at June 30, 2024.\nThe decrease was primarily due to $961,000 of cash dividends paid to shareholders and $1.5 million of stock repurchases,\npartly offset by net income of $1.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025 and the amortization of stock-based\ncompensation of $173,000. The Corporation repurchased 93,641 shares of its common stock in the open market at a weighted\naverage cost of $14.26 per share during the first three months of fiscal 2025 pursuant to its publicly announced stock\nrepurchase program. In addition, the Corporation acquired 8,758 shares of Corporation common stock at a cost of $13.24 per\nshare in settlement of employees' withholding tax obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock in the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $1.9 million, up $138,000 or eight percent from $1.8 million in the same\nperiod of fiscal 2024. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a $697,000 recovery of credit losses in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 (in contrast to a $545,000 provision for credit losses in the same quarter last year) and a $148,000\nincrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a $667,000 increase in non-interest expense and a $523,000 decrease in net\ninterest income.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, was\n79.06 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 69.32 percent in the same period last year. The deterioration of\nthe efficiency ratio during the current quarter compared to the same period last year was due both to higher non-interest\nexpenses and a lower net interest income.\nReturn on average assets was 0.61 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up seven basis points from 0.54 percent in the\nsame period last year. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 5.78 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up from\n5.40 percent in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $0.28, up 12\npercent from $0.25 in the same period last year.\nNet Interest Income:\nNet interest income decreased $523,000 or six percent to $8.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $9.1 million for\nthe same quarter last year. The decrease in net interest income was due to a lower average balance of interest-earning assets\nand, to a lesser extent, a lower net interest margin. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $54.7 million, or\nfour percent, to $1.22 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.27 billion the same quarter last year as the average\nbalances of investment securities, loans receivable and interest-earning deposits all declined. The average balance of interest-\nbearing liabilities decreased $51.3 million, or four percent, to $1.10 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.15 billion\nin the same quarter last year primarily reflecting the decrease in the average balance of deposits. The lower net interest margin\nwas due to the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which exceeded the increase in the average yield on\ninterest-earning assets. The net interest margin during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased four basis points to 2.84\npercent from 2.88 percent in the same quarter last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 43 basis points\nto 4.63 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.20 percent in the same quarter last year, while the average cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased 52 basis points to 1.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.45 percent in the\nsame quarter last year.\nInterest Income:\nTotal interest income increased $733,000, or five percent, to $14.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $13.3\nmillion for the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from loans\nreceivable, partly offset by a decrease in interest income from interest-earnings deposits.\nInterest income on loans receivable increased $847,000, or seven percent, to $13.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nfrom $12.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was due to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower\naverage balance. The average yield on loans receivable increased 43 basis points to 4.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal\n2025 from an average yield of 4.54 percent in the same quarter last year. The higher weighted average loan yield was due\nprimarily to the upward repricing of adjustable rate loans and new loan originations with higher weighted average interest\nrates. Adjustable-rate loans of approximately $122.2 million were repriced upward in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 by\napproximately 108 basis points from an average yield of 7.40 percent to 8.48 percent. The average balance of loans receivable\ndecreased $23.5 million, or two percent, to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.07 billion in the same\nquarter last year. Net deferred loan cost amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 85 percent to $355,000 from\n$192,000 in the same quarter last year. Total loans originated for investment in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $28.9\nmillion, up 56 percent from $18.5 million in the same quarter last year; while loan principal payments received in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 were $34.0 million, up 48 percent from $23.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nInterest income from investment securities decreased $42,000, or eight percent, to $482,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nfrom $524,000 for the same quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was attributable to a lower average balance, partly offset by a\nhigher average yield. The average balance of investment securities decreased $24.1 million, or 16 percent, to $129.6 million in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $153.7 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in the average balance of\ninvestment securities was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities.\nThe average yield on investment securities increased 13 basis points to 1.49 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from\n1.36 percent for the same quarter last year. The increase in the average yield was primarily attributable to a lower premium\namortization during the current quarter in comparison to the same quarter last year\n39\nTable of Contents\n($110,000 vs. $155,000) due to lower total principal repayments ($5.7 million vs. $6.7 million) and the upward repricing of\nadjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Bank received $210,000 of cash dividends from FHLB – San Francisco stock and other equity investments in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025, up 17 percent from $179,000 in the same quarter last year. The average balance of FHLB – San\nFrancisco stock and other equity investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $10.1 million, up six percent from $9.5\nmillion in the same quarter of fiscal 2024 while the average yield was 8.30 percent, up 77 basis points from 7.53 percent.\nInterest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the FRB of San Francisco, was $360,000 in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025, down 22 percent from $463,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was due a lower\naverage balance, partly offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of interest-earning deposits decreased $7.7\nmillion, or 23 percent, to $26.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $34.0 million in the same quarter last year\nprimarily due to the Bank decreasing its liquidity position, which was mitigated by adequate borrowing capacities. The\naverage yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 5.35 percent, up three basis points from\n5.32 percent in the same quarter last year, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves.\nInterest Expense:\nTotal interest expense increased $1.3 million or 31 percent to $5.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $4.2 million\nin the same quarter last year. The increase was attributable to higher interest expense on borrowings and time deposits.\nInterest expense on deposits for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.8 million, a 50 percent increase from $1.9 million for\nthe same quarter last year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to a higher average cost and, to a lesser\nextent, a higher average balance of time deposits. The average cost of deposits was 1.27 percent for the first quarter of fiscal\n2025, up 47 basis points from 0.80 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily attributable to the average cost of time\ndeposits (including brokered certificates of deposit) which increased 79 basis points to 3.95 percent for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025 from 3.16 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The average balance of deposits decreased six percent to\n$880.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $940.2 million in the same quarter last year due to decreases in\ntransaction accounts which was partly offset by an increase in time deposits. The average balance of transaction accounts was\n$613.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down 14 percent from $715.2 million in the same quarter last year; while the\naverage balance of time deposits (including brokered certificates of deposit) increased 19 percent to $267.3 million in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 from $225.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nInterest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB – San Francisco advances, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased\n$317,000, or 14 percent, to $2.6 million from $2.3 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily the result\nof a higher average cost of borrowings and, to a lesser extent, a higher average balance. The average cost of borrowings\nincreased 41 basis points to 4.74 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.33 percent in the same quarter last year and\nthe average balance of borrowings increased $8.2 million or four percent to $220.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nfrom $212.5 million in the same quarter last year.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth certain information for the periods regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as\nthe total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-\nbearing liabilities and average yields and costs thereof.

The recovery of credit losses recorded in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to a shorter estimated life of the loan portfolio resulting from decreased\nmarket interest rates and higher loan prepayment estimates.\nAt September 30, 2024, the ACL on loans held for investment was $6.3 million, comprised of all collectively evaluated\nallowances, down 11 percent from $7.1 million at June 30, 2024 that were comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of\n$7.1 million and individually evaluated allowanced of $37,000. The ACL on loans as a percentage of gross loans held for\ninvestment was 0.61 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.67 percent at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the ACL on\nloans was due primarily to the recovery of credit losses in the first three months of fiscal 2025 ($697,000, which includes a\n$39,000 provision for unfunded loan commitment reserve).\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following chart quantifies the factors contributing to the changes in the ACL on loans held for investment (“LHFI”) for\nthe quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe changes in the ACL on LHFI for the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\nThe changes in the ACL on LHFI for the quarter ended September 30, 2023:\nManagement considers, based on currently available information, the ACL on loans sufficient to absorb expected losses in\nloans held for investment. See “Asset Quality” below and Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion regarding the ACL on LHFI.\nNon-Interest Income:\nNon-interest income increased $148,000, or 20 percent, to $899,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $751,000 in the\nsame period last year, due primarily to a $125,000 increase in loan servicing and other fees (mainly attributable to a net fair\nvalue adjustment on unsaleable loans).\n43\nTable of Contents\nNon-Interest Expense:\nFor the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Non-interest expenses increased $667,000, or 10 percent, to $7.5\nmillion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $6.9 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in the non-interest\nexpense in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $519,000, or 13 percent, to $4.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from $4.1\nmillion in the same quarter of fiscal 2024, representing the largest increase in non-interest expense. The increase was due\nprimarily to higher employee compensation, incentive compensation and retirement plan expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes:\nThe income tax provision was $789,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up nine percent from $727,000 in the same quarter\nlast year primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 29.3 percent as\ncompared to 29.2 percent in the same quarter last year.\nThe income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax\nbased upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial\nreporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and earnings from bank-owned life insurance policies,\namong others. Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship\nof net permanent differences to income before tax.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets were comprised solely of 10 non-performing single-family loans at both September 30, 2024 and June\n30, 2024. Non-performing loans, net of the ACL, consisting of loans with collateral located in California, were $2.1 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, down 19 percent from $2.6 million at June 30, 2024. Non-performing loans as a percentage of LHFI at\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 0.20 percent, compared to 0.25 percent at June 30, 2024. No interest accruals were made for non-\nperforming loans. There were no loans that were past due 90 days or more and no real estate owned at either September 30,\n2024 or June 30, 2024. For further analysis on non-performing loans, see the tables below and Note 5 of the Notes to\nUnaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the Corporation’s non-performing assets, net of ACL, at the dates\nindicated:\nAt September 30, At June 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2024\nLoans on non-performing status\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ 2,106 $ 2,596\nTotal 2,106 2,596\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more — —\nTotal non-performing loans 2,106 2,596\nReal estate owned, net — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 2,106 $ 2,596\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of LHFI, net of ACL 0.20 % 0.25 %\nNon-performing loans as a percentage of total assets 0.17 % 0.20 %\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.17 % 0.20 %\nThe following table summarizes classified assets, which is comprised of classified loans, net of ACL and real estate owned, if\nany, at the dates indicated:\nAt September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024\n(Dollars In Thousands) Balance Count Balance Count\nSpecial mention loans:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family $ — — $ 1,099 1\nMulti-family 635 1 — —\nTotal special mention loans 635 1 1,099 1\nSubstandard loans:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family 2,106 10 2,596 10\nMulti-family 1,520 2 2,066 3\nCommercial real estate 418 2 — —\nTotal substandard loans 4,044 14 4,662 13\nTotal classified loans 4,679 15 5,761 14\nReal estate owned — — — —\nTotal classified assets $ 4,679 15 $ 5,761 14\nTotal classified assets as a percentage of total assets 0.37 % 0.45 %\nA decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of the Corporation’s real estate secured loans could result\nin higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real\nestate markets are beyond the Corporation’s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local\neconomic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans\n45\nTable of Contents\nto potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such\nas earthquakes, fires and national disasters particular to California where substantially all of the Corporation’s real estate\ncollateral is located. If real estate values decline, the value of the real estate collateral securing the Corporation’s loans as set\nforth in the table could be significantly overstated. The Corporation’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and\nselling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The\nCorporation generally does not update the loan-to-value ratio on its LHFI by obtaining new appraisals or broker price opinions\n(nor does the Corporation intend to do so in the future as a result of the costs and inefficiencies associated with completing the\ntask) unless a specific loan has demonstrated deterioration in which case individually evaluated allowances are established, if\nrequired.\nLoan Volume Activities\nThe following table provides details related to the volume of loan originations, sales and principal payments for the quarters\nindicated:\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In Thousands) 2024 2023\nLoans originated for sale:\nWholesale originations $ 2,152 $ —\nTotal loans originated for sale 2,152 —\nLoans sold:\nServicing retained (2,152) —\nTotal loans sold (2,152) —\nLoans originated for investment:\nMortgage loans:\nSingle-family 22,449 12,452\nMulti-family 5,190 5,113\nCommercial real estate 1,260 939\nCommercial business loans 50 —\nTotal loans originated for investment 28,949 18,504\nLoan principal payments (34,031) (22,988)\nIncrease (decrease) in other items, net⁽¹⁾ 736 (975)\nNet decrease in loans held for investment $ (4,346) $ (5,459)\n(1) Includes net changes in undisbursed loan funds, deferred loan fees or costs, ACL, fair value of loans held for investment\nand advance payments of escrows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Corporation’s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and\ninvestment securities, proceeds from the maturity of loans and investment securities, FHLB – San Francisco advances, access\nto the discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco and access to a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds,\ndeposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and\ncompetition.\nThe primary investing activity of the Corporation is the origination and purchase of loans held for investment. During the first\nthree months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Corporation originated loans held for investment of $28.9 million and $18.5\n46\nTable of Contents\nmillion, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had loan origination commitments totaling $15.3 million,\nundisbursed lines of credit totaling $3.5 million and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling $311,000. The Corporation\nanticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan funding commitments. During the first three\nmonths of fiscal 2025 and 2024, total loan repayments were $34.0 million and $23.0 million, respectively.\nThe Corporation’s primary financing activity is gathering deposits and, when needed, borrowings, principally FHLB – San\nFrancisco advances. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, total deposits decreased $24.4 million, or three percent, to\n$863.9 million, due to the declines in all account categories, except money market accounts. The time deposits include\nbrokered certificates of deposit totaling $129.8 million and $131.8 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024, time deposits with a principal amount of $250,000 or less and scheduled to mature in\none year or less were $188.1 million and total time deposits with a principal amount of more than $250,000 and scheduled to\nmature in one year or less were $37.2 million. Historically, the Corporation has been able to retain most of its time deposits as\nthey mature.\nThe Corporation must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan\ngrowth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The\nCorporation maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At September 30, 2024, total\ncash and cash equivalents were $48.2 million, or four percent of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing\nof deposit products, the Bank may rely on FHLB – San Francisco advances for part of its liquidity needs. As of September 30,\n2024, total borrowings were $249.5 million and the financing availability at the FHLB – San Francisco was limited to\n40 percent of total assets. As a result, the remaining borrowing capacity available was $249.2 million and the remaining\navailable collateral was $346.9 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Bank has secured a $211.5 million discount\nwindow facility at the FRB of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities and single-family fixed-rate loans with a\ntotal balance of $295.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank also has a borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal\nfunds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under its discount window or\ncorrespondent bank facilities as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank continues to work with both the FHLB - San Francisco and FRB of San Francisco to ensure that borrowing capacity\nis continuously reviewed and updated in order to be accessed seamlessly should the need arise. This includes establishing\naccounts and pledging assets as needed in order to maximize borrowing capacity and liquidity. The total remaining available\nborrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately $510.7 million at September 30, 2024.\nRegulations require the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank’s average liquidity\nratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 16.6 percent, unchanged from the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing up to 350,353 shares of the\nCorporation’s outstanding common stock to be purchased over a one-year period. On September 26, 2024, the Board approved\nan extension of the stock repurchase plan for another year. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 95,475 shares or 27 percent of\nauthorized shares for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan remained available to purchase. The Corporation purchases\nthe shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions,\nthe capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among\nother considerations.\nProvident Financial Holdings is a separate legal entity from the Bank and, on a stand-alone level, must provide for its own\nliquidity and pay its own operating expenses and cash dividends. Provident Financial Holdings’ primary sources of funds\nconsist of capital raised through dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are general regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. We expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash\ndividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors’ discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time\nand for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.14 per share, as approved by\nour Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of\nmanaging and investing in the Bank, and returning a portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued cash\ndividend payments during fiscal 2025 at $0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately\n$948,000 based on the number of outstanding shares at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation (on an\nunconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $9.8 million.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the\nOCC. Under the OCC’s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank was categorized as \"well-\ncapitalized\" at September 30, 2024 under the regulations of the OCC. As a bank holding company registered with the Federal\nReserve, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is also subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve. For a\nbank holding company with less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal\nReserve expects the holding company’s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.\nThe Bank’s actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios at the dates indicated are as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nRegulatory Requirements\nMinimum for Capital Minimum to Be\nActual Adequacy Purposes Well Capitalized\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio(1) Amount Ratio\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B.:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average\nassets) $ 119,881 9.63 % $ 49,803 4.00 % $ 62,253 5.00 %\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 119,881 18.36 % $ 45,701 7.00 % $ 42,437 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 119,881 18.36 % $ 55,494 8.50 % $ 52,230 8.00 %\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 126,306 19.35 % $ 68,552 10.50 % $ 65,288 10.00 %\nAs of June 30, 2024 (2)\nTier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average\nassets) $ 126,601 10.02 % $ 50,555 4.00 % $ 63,194 5.00 %\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 126,601 19.29 % $ 45,934 7.00 % $ 42,653 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 126,601 19.29 % $ 55,777 8.50 % $ 52,496 8.00 %\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 133,723 20.38 % $ 68,900 10.50 % $ 65,620 10.00 %\n(1) Inclusive of the conservation buffer of 2.50% for Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\nratios.\n(2) The Bank elected to recognize the full $824 thousand adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of CECL\non July 1, 2023 instead of over the permitted three-year phase-in option.\nIn addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer\nconsisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to\navoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages\nof eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nIf the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay\ndividends to its stockholders. The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend if the effect thereafter would cause its net\nworth to be reduced below the regulatory capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. On September 26, 2024, the\nBank paid $9.0 million cash dividend to the Holding Company.\n48\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental Information\nAt At At\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30,\n2024 2024 2023\nLoans serviced for others (in thousands) $ 34,950 $ 34,598 $ 31,687\nBook value per share $ 19.15 $ 18.98 $ 18.44\nITEM 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nOne of the Corporation’s principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to\nfluctuating interest rates. The Corporation has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by\nattempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal\nelement in achieving this objective is to increase the interest-rate sensitivity of the Corporation’s interest-earning assets by\nretaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions.\nIn addition, the Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, which is largely comprised of U.S. government sponsored\nenterprise MBS with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently or have a relatively short average life. The\nCorporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing FHLB – San Francisco advances and, from\ntime to time, brokered certificates of deposit as a secondary source of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike\nbrokered certificates of deposit, reduces the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable\nsource of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time\ndeposits with terms up to seven years.\nUsing an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the\nchange in net portfolio value (“NPV”) over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present value of\nexpected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments, if any. The calculation is intended to\nillustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -300, -200, -100, +100,\n+200 and +300 basis points (“bp”) with no consideration given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of\nthe interest rate movement. As of September 30, 2024, the targeted federal funds rate range was 4.75% to 5.00%.\nThe following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the NPV based on the indicated\nchanges in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands).\nNet Portfolio NPV as Percentage\nBasis Points (\"bp\") Portfolio NPV Value of of Portfolio Value Sensitivity\nChange in Rates Value Change(1) Assets Assets(2) Measure(3)\n+300 bp $ 131,607 $ (14,988) $ 1,259,406 10.45 % -95 bp\n+200 bp $ 144,327 $ (2,268) $ 1,275,880 11.31 % -9 bp\n+100 bp $ 152,064 $ 5,469 $ 1,287,442 11.81 % 41 bp\nBase Case $ 146,595 $ — $ 1,285,871 11.40 % —\n-100 bp $ 142,389 $ (4,206) $ 1,285,639 11.08 % -32 bp\n-200 bp $ 129,893 $ (16,702) $ 1,277,196 10.17 % -123 bp\n-300 bp $ 137,550 $ (9,045) $ 1,288,983 10.67 % -73 bp\n(1) Represents the (decrease) increase of the NPV at the indicated interest rate change to the NPV at September 30, 2024\n(“base case”).\n(2) Derived from the NPV divided by the portfolio value of assets.\n(3) Derived from the change in the NPV as a Percentage of Portfolio Value Assets from the base case ratio assuming the\nindicated change in interest rates (expressed in basis points).\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is derived from the interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a -200 basis point rate\nshock at September 30, 2024 and a +200 basis point rate shock at June 30, 2024, each of which scenarios were the most severe\nshock of plus or minus 200 basis point rate shocks.\nAt September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024\n(-200 bp rate shock) (+200 bp rate shock)\nPre-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets 11.40 % 10.12 %\nPost-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets 10.17 % 9.17 %\nSensitivity Measure: Change in NPV Ratio -123 bp -95 bp\nThe pre-shock NPV ratio increased 128 basis points to 11.40 percent at September 30, 2024 from 10.12 percent at June 30,\n2024 and the post-shock NPV ratio increased 100 basis points to 10.17 percent at September 30, 2024 from 9.17 percent at\nJune 30, 2024. The increase of the pre-shock NPV ratio was primarily attributable to the changes in market interest rates, the\ncomposition of the balance sheet and the net income in the first three months of fiscal 2025, partly offset by a $9.0 million\ncash dividend distribution from the Bank to Provident Financial Holdings in September 2024.\nAs with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in\nthe foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing,\nthey may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and\nliabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and\nliabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”)\nloans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the loan. Further, in the\nevent of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could\nlikely deviate significantly from those assumptions used when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also\npossible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM loans could result in an\nincrease in delinquencies and defaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as\nindicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is\nnot intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for\ndistribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity\n\"gap\" analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest\nrates. For loans held for investment, investment securities, deposits and borrowings with contractual maturities, the table\npresents contractual repricing or scheduled maturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits)\nthat have no contractual maturity, the table presents estimated principal cash flows and, as applicable, the Corporation’s\nhistorical experience, management’s judgment and statistical analysis concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents the interest rate gap analysis of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities as of September 30,\n2024:\nTerm to Contractual Repricing, Estimated Repricing, or Contractual\nMaturity(1)\nAs of September 30, 2024\nGreater than Greater than Greater than\n12 months or 1 year to 3 3 years to 5 years or\n(Dollars In Thousands) less years 5 years non-sensitive Total\nRepricing Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 41,708 $ — $ — $ 6,485 $ 48,193\nInvestment securities 6,931 — — 119,146 126,077\nLoans held for investment 268,361 212,537 244,848 322,887 1,048,633\nFHLB – San Francisco stock\nand other equity investments 10,133 — — — 10,133\nOther assets 4,287 — — 20,057 24,344\nTotal assets $ 331,420 $ 212,537 $ 244,848 $ 468,575 $ 1,257,380\nRepricing Liabilities and Equity:\nChecking deposits - noninterest-\nbearing $ — $ — $ — $ 86,458 $ 86,458\nChecking deposits - interest\nbearing 37,391 74,781 74,781 62,318 249,271\nSavings deposits 47,580 95,160 95,161 — 237,901\nMoney market deposits 13,026 13,025 — — 26,051\nTime deposits 225,294 33,902 4,220 767 264,183\nBorrowings 117,500 117,000 15,000 — 249,500\nOther liabilities 1,634 — — 12,776 14,410\nStockholders' equity — — — 129,606 129,606\nTotal liabilities and\nstockholders' equity $ 442,425 $ 333,868 $ 189,162 $ 291,925 $ 1,257,380\nRepricing gap (negative) positive $ (111,005) $ (121,331) $ 55,686 $ 176,650 $ —\nCumulative repricing gap:\nDollar amount $ (111,005) $ (232,336) $ (176,650) $ — $ —\nPercent of total assets (9)% (18)% (14)% — % — %\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents are presented as estimated repricing; investment securities and loans held for investment are\npresented as contractual maturities or contractual repricing (without consideration for prepayments); FHLB - San\nFrancisco stock and other equity investments are presented as contractual repricing; transaction accounts (checking,\nsavings and money market deposits) are presented as estimated repricing; while time deposits (without consideration for\nearly withdrawals) and borrowings are presented as contractual maturities.\nThe static gap analysis under “12 months or less” duration, “Greater than 1 year to 3 years” duration and “Greater than 3 years\nto 5 years” duration show negative positions in the \"Cumulative repricing gap - dollar amount\" category, indicating more\nliabilities are sensitive to repricing than assets in the short and intermediate terms. Management views noninterest-bearing\ndeposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term\nfunding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity for savings and\nmoney market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances are assumed to\nbe subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15% per year, savings deposits at 20% per\nyear and money market deposits at 50% in the first and second years.\nThe gap results presented above could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from\nthe assumptions used in the preparation of the gap analysis. Furthermore, the gap analysis provides a static view of\n51\nTable of Contents\ninterest rate risk exposure at a specific point in time without taking into account redirection of cash flow activity and deposit\nfluctuations.\nThe extent to which the net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of\nfactors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not\nuncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag changes in the market interest rates. Additionally, prepayments of\nloans and early withdrawals of time deposits could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the relationship between\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the previous table, is only a general indicator of interest rate\nsensitivity and the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted solely on\nthe basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the previous table.\nThe Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end\nassuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items:\n● The Corporation’s current balance sheet and repricing characteristics;\n● Forecasted balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan;\n● Current interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates;\n● Embedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps;\n● Repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments;\n● Loan, investment security, deposit and borrowing cash flows;\n● Loan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; and\n● Immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of +300, +200 and +100, and -100, -200 and\n-300 basis points.\nThe following table describes the results of the sensitivity of the net interest income analysis at September 30, 2024 and June\n30, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024\nBasis Point (bp) Change in Basis Point (bp) Change in\nChange in Rates Net Interest Income Change in Rates Net Interest Income\n+300 bp -1.29% +300 bp -8.12%\n+200 bp 0.26% +200 bp -3.45%\n+100 bp 0.32% +100 bp -0.51%\n-100 bp -0.43% -100 bp -0.67%\n-200 bp -1.91% -200 bp -1.15%\n-300 bp -4.80% -300 bp -1.86%\nAt September 30, 2024, the Corporation was in a slightly asset sensitive position as its interest-earning assets were expected to\nreprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12-month period. Therefore, in a rising interest\nrate environment, the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period, except under the\n+300 basis point scenario. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project a decrease in net interest income over the\nsubsequent 12-month period.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Corporation was close to neutral with regard to the sensitivity of net interest income as projected net\ninterest income declines slightly under rising or declining interest rates during the subsequent 12-month period.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable.\nHowever, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily\noccur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates,\nactual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis,\nparticularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore, the model results that the\nCorporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporation’s current\ndisclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve.\n52\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4 – Controls and Procedures.\n(a) An evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the\nCorporation’s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and\naccounting officer) and the Corporation’s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In\ndesigning and evaluating the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that\nthe objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control\nprocedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,\nwithin the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and\nprocedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all\npotential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective, at the\nreasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or\nsubmits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management (including the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\n(b) There have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of\nthe Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and\noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of\nthe inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities\nthat judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about\nthe likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under\nall potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control\nprocedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nPeriodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens,\ncondemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and\nservicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the\nCorporation’s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual\nmatters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the\nCorporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it\nbelieves would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.\n53\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A.

We are first mailing this Proxy Statement and the enclosed form of proxy to our shareholders on or about October 24, 2024.\nThe information provided in this Proxy Statement relates to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B.\nProvident Financial Holdings, Inc. may also be referred to as “Provident” and Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. may also be referred to as “Provident Savings Bank” or the\n“Bank.” References to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Provident and, as the context requires, Provident Savings Bank.\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING\nOur annual meeting will be held as follows:\nDate: Thursday, November 21, 2024\nTime: 11:00 a.m., local time\nPlace: Virtual meeting at https://meetnow.global/MWMHWZU\nMatters to Be Considered at the Annual Meeting\nAt the meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:\nProposal 1. Election of two directors to each serve for a term of three years.\nProposal 2. Advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.\nProposal 3. Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for Provident Financial\nHoldings, Inc. for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\nWe also will transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other business\nto be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than the matters described in this Proxy Statement.\nWho Is Entitled to Vote?\nWe have fixed the close of business on October 10, 2024 as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at our annual meeting. Only holders\nof record of Provident’s common stock on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Provident\ncommon stock you own. On October 10, 2024, there were 6,769,247 shares of Provident common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.\nHow Do I Vote at the Annual Meeting?\nProxies are solicited to provide all shareholders on the voting record date an opportunity to vote on matters scheduled for the annual meeting and described in\nthese materials. This answer provides voting instructions for shareholders of record. You are a shareholder of record if your shares of Provident common stock are held in\nyour name. If you are a beneficial owner of Provident common stock held by a broker, bank or other nominee, please see the instructions below, under “What if My Shares\nAre Held in Street Name?”\nShares of Provident common stock can only be voted if the shareholder is present virtually or by proxy at the annual meeting. To ensure your representation at\nthe annual meeting, we recommend you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the virtual annual meeting. You can always change your vote at the meeting if you\nare a shareholder of record by following the instructions on the proxy card.\nShareholders may vote by proxy via the Internet or a toll-free telephone number, or by mailing a proxy card. Voting instructions are included on your proxy card.\nShares of Provident common stock represented by properly executed proxies will be voted by the individuals named on the proxy card in accordance with the shareholder’s\ninstructions. Where properly executed proxies are returned to us with no specific instruction as how to vote at the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote\nthe shares FOR the election of each of our director nominees, FOR advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy\nStatement and FOR the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. If any other matters are properly presented at the annual\nmeeting for action, the persons named in the enclosed proxy and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.\nWe do not currently expect that any other matters will be properly presented for action at the annual meeting.\nYou may receive more than one proxy card depending on how your shares are held. For example, you may hold some of your shares individually, some jointly\nwith your spouse and some in trust for your children. In this case, you will receive three separate proxy cards to vote.\nWhat if My Shares Are Held in Street Name?\nIf you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, the nominee, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote\nthe shares in accordance with your instructions. If your common stock is held in street name, you will receive instructions from the nominee that you must follow in order\nto have your shares voted. The nominee may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the Internet. Please see the instruction form that\naccompanies this Proxy Statement. If you do not give instructions to the nominee, the nominee may nevertheless vote the shares with respect to discretionary items, but\nwill not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to non-discretionary items, pursuant to current industry practice. In the case of non-discretionary items, shares not\nvoted are treated as “broker non-votes.” The proposal to elect directors and the advisory vote on executive compensation are considered non-discretionary items; therefore,\nyou must provide instructions to your broker in order to have your shares voted on these proposals.\nIf your shares are held in street name, you must register in advance to participate in the virtual annual meeting. To register to participate in the annual meeting,\nyou must submit proof of your proxy power (legal proxy) reflecting your Provident holdings along with your name and email address to Computershare. Requests for\nregistration must be labeled as “Legal Proxy” and be received no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 18, 2024. Requests for registration by email may be\nmade by forwarding the email from the nominee who holds yours shares, or attaching an image of your legal proxy and emailing it to legalproxy@computershare.com.\nRequests for registration by mail should be sent to Computershare, Provident Legal Proxy, P.O. Box 43001, Providence, RI 02940-3001. You will receive a confirmation of\nyour registration by email after Computershare receives your registration materials.\nHow Will My Shares of Common Stock Held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan Be Voted?\nWe maintain an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) for the benefit of our employees. Each ESOP participant may instruct the ESOP trustee how to vote the\nshares of Provident common stock allocated to his or her\n2\naccount under the ESOP by completing the proxy card, which represents a voting instruction to the trustees. If an ESOP participant properly executes the proxy card, the\nESOP trustee will vote the participant’s shares in accordance with the participant’s instructions. Unallocated shares of Provident common stock held by the ESOP and\nallocated shares for which no voting instructions are received will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion as shares for which the trustee has received voting\ninstructions.\nHow Many Shares Must Be Present to Hold the Meeting?\nA quorum must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the meeting, virtually or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares\nof Provident common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting as of the record date will constitute a quorum. Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non-\nvotes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.\nWhat if a Quorum Is Not Present at the Meeting?\nIf a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the meeting, a majority of the shareholders present virtually or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting\nuntil a quorum is present. The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice will be given unless the\nmeeting is adjourned for 30 days or more. An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the meeting.\nVote Required to Approve Proposal 1: Election of Directors\nDirectors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting by holders of Provident common stock. Accordingly, the two nominees for election as\ndirectors who receive the highest number of votes actually cast will be elected. Pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, shareholders are not permitted to cumulate\ntheir votes for the election of directors. Votes may be cast for or withheld from each nominee. Votes that are withheld and broker non-votes will have no effect on the\noutcome of the election because the two nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you\nvote FOR the election of each of its director nominees.\nVote Required to Approve Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation\nThe advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at the\nannual meeting by holders of Provident common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the approval of\nthe proposal. Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our\nnamed executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.\nVote Required to Approve Proposal 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nRatification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual\nmeeting by holders of Provident common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the approval of the\nproposal. Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Provident’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\n3\nMay I Revoke My Proxy?\nYou may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:\n• submitting a new proxy with a later date;\n• notifying the Secretary of Provident in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or\n• voting at the annual meeting.\nIf you plan to attend the virtual annual meeting and vote during the meeting, instructions for voting will be provided.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth, as of October 10, 2024, the voting record date, information regarding share ownership of:\n• those persons or entities (or groups of affiliated persons or entities) known by management to beneficially own more than five percent of Provident’s\ncommon stock;\n• each director and director nominee of Provident;\n• each executive officer of Provident or Provident Savings Bank named in the Summary Compensation Table appearing under “Executive Compensation”\nbelow (known as “named executive officers”); and\n• all current directors and executive officers of Provident and Provident Savings Bank as a group.\nPersons and groups who beneficially own in excess of five percent of Provident’s common stock are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) reports disclosing their ownership pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. To our knowledge, no other person or entity, other than those set forth below,\nbeneficially owned more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Provident’s common stock as of the close of business on the voting record date.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. In accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act, a\nperson is deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of common stock if he or she has voting and/or investment power with respect to those shares. Therefore, the\ntable below includes shares owned by spouses, other immediate family members in trust, shares held in retirement accounts or funds for the benefit of the named\nindividuals, and other forms of ownership, over which shares the persons named in the table may possess voting and/or investment power. In addition, in computing the\nnumber of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to outstanding options that are currently\nexercisable or exercisable within 60 days after the voting record date are included in the number of shares beneficially owned by the person and are deemed outstanding for\nthe purpose of calculating the person’s percentage ownership. These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership\nof any other person.\n4\nNumber of Shares Percent of Shares\nName Beneficially Owned (1) Outstanding (%)\nBeneficial Owners of More Than 5%\nProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B.

Each of the categories listed in the table below has the meaning as it is used in Nasdaq Rule 5605(f).\nBoard Diversity Matrix (As of October 10, 2024)\nTotal Number of Directors 7\nDid Not\nDisclose\nPart I: Gender Identity Female Male Non-binary Gender\nDirectors 3 4 -- --\nPart II: Demographic Background\nHispanic or Latinx -- -- -- --\nWhite 3 2 -- --\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities -- -- -- --\nLGBTQ+ 1\nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background 2\n8\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS’ MEETINGS, BOARD COMMITTEES\nAND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS\nBoard of Directors\nThe Boards of Directors of Provident and Provident Savings Bank conduct their business through board and committee meetings. During the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2024, the Provident Board of Directors held 11 meetings and the Bank Board of Directors held 11 meetings. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total\nmeetings of the boards and committees on which that person served during this period.\nCommittees and Committee Charters\nProvident’s Board of Directors has a standing Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Boards of Directors of Provident and Provident Savings\nBank have a joint Audit Committee and Personnel/Compensation Committee. All of these committees have adopted written charters, copies of which are available on our\nwebsite at www.myprovident.com.\nAudit Committee. The Audit Committee, which currently consists of Directors Carpenter (Chair), Michalak and Webb, is responsible for reviewing the adequacy\nof our system of internal accounting controls, approving the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm and meeting with the firm to discuss\nthe results of the annual audit and any related matters. The Audit Committee has a charter which specifies its obligations and the Committee believes it has fulfilled its\nresponsibilities under the charter. Each member of the Audit Committee is “independent,” in accordance with the requirements for companies listed on Nasdaq. The Audit\nCommittee members do not have any relationship with us that may interfere with the exercise of their independence from management and Provident. None of the Audit\nCommittee members are current officers or employees of Provident or its affiliates. Ms. Carpenter meets the definition of “audit committee financial expert,” as defined by\nthe SEC. The Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which currently consists of Directors Thomas\n(Chairman), Carpenter, Guthrie, Michalak, Webb and Hawley, selects the nominees for election as directors. The Committee also assists the Board in identifying\nindividuals to become Board members and in developing and implementing corporate governance policies. Each member of the Committee is “independent,” in\naccordance with the requirements for companies listed on Nasdaq. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once during the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024.\nOnly those nominations made by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or properly presented by shareholders will be voted upon at the annual\nmeeting of shareholders. In its deliberations for selecting candidates for nominees as director, the Committee considers the candidate’s knowledge of the banking business;\ninvolvement in local community, business and civic affairs; record of accomplishment in his or her chosen field; depth and breadth of experience at an executive, policy-\nmaking level; personal and professional ethics, integrity and values; absence of real and perceived conflicts of interest; ability and willingness to devote sufficient time to\nbecome knowledgeable about Provident and to effectively carry out the duties and responsibilities of service; ability to attend all or almost all Board meetings in person;\nability to develop a good working relationship with other Board members; ability to contribute to the Board’s working relationship with senior management; and whether\nthe candidate would provide for adequate representation of Provident Savings Bank’s market area. Any nominee for director made by the Committee must be highly\nqualified with regard to some or all of these attributes. Finally, viewpoint, skill, education, values, race, gender, national origin and culture are considered to provide for\ndiversity on our Board of Directors. These diversity factors are considered when the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board are seeking to fill a\nvacancy or new seat on the Board.\nIn searching for qualified director candidates to fill vacancies on the Board, the Committee solicits its current Board of Directors for names of potentially qualified\ncandidates. Additionally, the Committee may request that members of the Board of Directors pursue their own business contacts for the names of potentially qualified\ncandidates. The Committee would then consider the potential pool of director candidates, select the candidate the Committee believes\n9\nbest meets the then-current needs of the Board, and conduct a thorough investigation of the proposed candidate’s background to ensure there is no past history that would\ncause the candidate not to be qualified to serve as a director of Provident. Although the Committee’s charter does not specifically provide for the consideration of\nshareholder nominees for directors, the Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our shareholders in accordance with Provident’s Certificate of\nIncorporation. Because the Certificate of Incorporation provides a process for shareholder nominations, the Committee does not feel it is necessary to provide for\nshareholder nominations of directors in a charter. If a shareholder submits a proposed nominee, the Committee will consider the proposed nominee, along with any other\nproposed nominees recommended by members of our Board of Directors, in the same manner in which the Committee will evaluate its nominees for director. For a\ndescription of the proper procedure for shareholder nominations, see “Shareholder Proposals” in this Proxy Statement.\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee. The Personnel/Compensation Committee, currently consisting of Directors Thomas (Chairman), Guthrie and Hawley, is\nresponsible for establishing and implementing all compensation policies of Provident, Provident Savings Bank and its subsidiaries and may delegate lower level policies\nand procedures to the Human Resource Department. The Committee is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and\napproving an appropriate compensation level. The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of all senior officers of the Bank and recommends to the Committee\nindividual compensation levels for approval by the Committee. The Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nLeadership Structure\nThe positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are held by different people, which has been the case since Craig G. Blunden’s transition\nfrom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to non-executive Chairman in January 2024. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of Provident not to have a\npolicy regarding the separation of these roles, allowing the Board greater flexibility to establish a leadership structure that fits the needs of Provident at any particular point\nin time. The current structure allows the President and Chief Executive Officer to focus on the day-to-day business of running Provident, while the Chairman leads the\nBoard. We recognize that Mr. Blunden will not be considered an independent director and will therefore continue to appoint a lead independent director. Director Thomas\ncurrently serves as the lead independent director. The lead independent director serves as liaison between independent directors and the full Board in discussing issues\nfrom the executive sessions of independent directors, ensuring the flow of information and working in unison with the non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive\nOfficer. He is charged with leading the Board’s independent directors to engagement and consensus, making sure that independent consensus is heard and implemented\nregarding substantive business matters or governance issues.\nIn addition to having a lead independent director, the Board of Directors and the Audit and Personnel/ Compensation committees routinely meet in executive\nsession without management. Executive sessions are held after each regularly scheduled meeting. Executive sessions of the Board are led by the lead independent director\nand executive sessions of committees are led by the committee chair.\nBoard Involvement in Risk Management Process\nWe believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of Provident. We have a comprehensive risk management process that\nmonitors, evaluates and manages the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our Board’s oversight of the risk management process is conducted through:\n• the responsibilities of the Board’s standing committees;\n• Board-approved policies and procedures that limit the risk exposure of certain business activities;\n• periodic reports from management to ensure compliance with and evaluate the effectiveness of risk limits and controls;\n• employees who oversee day-to-day risk management duties, including the internal audit personnel who report directly to the Audit Committee, and\nCompliance Officer;\n10\n• selecting, evaluating, and retaining competent senior management; and\n• approval of long and short-term business objectives and goals contained in the Board approved business plan.\nDirectors keep themselves informed of the activities and condition of Provident and of the risk environment in which it operates by regularly attending Board and\nassigned Committee meetings, and by review of meeting materials, auditor’s findings and recommendations, and regulatory communications. Directors stay abreast of\ngeneral industry trends and statutory and regulatory developments by periodic briefings by senior management, counsel, auditors or other consultants, and by more formal\ndirector education.\nCorporate Governance\nWe are committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Board of Directors is cognizant of its responsibility to comply\nwith the provisions contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder, and the rules of Nasdaq with respect to corporate\ngovernance. The Board and its committees will continue to evaluate and improve our corporate governance principles and policies as necessary and as required.\nGovernance Highlights. Highlights of Provident’s corporate governance include the following:\n• Lead independent director and executive sessions of the Board and committees;\n• Shareholder engagement;\n• Stock ownership policy and retention guidelines\n• Restriction on hedging and pledging; and\n• Clawback of incentive payments.\nDirector Independence. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In accordance with Nasdaq requirements, at least a majority of our\ndirectors must be independent directors. The Board has determined that six of our seven directors are independent, as defined by Nasdaq. Directors Carpenter, Guthrie,\nMichalak, Thomas, Webb and Hawley are all independent. Only Craig Blunden, who is our Chairman, is not independent. Former Directors Bruce W. Bennett and Roy H.\nTaylor were independent.\nCode of Ethics. On June 30, 1995, the Board of Directors initially adopted and approved a Code of Ethics. Subsequently, the Code of Ethics has been reviewed\nand approved by the Board of Directors each year, with the Board most recently having reviewed and approved the Code of Ethics on June 27, 2024. The Code is\napplicable to our employees, as well as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and senior management, and requires\nindividuals to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.myprovident.com.\nShareholder Communication with the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors maintains a process for shareholders to communicate with the Board.\nShareholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so by mailing a letter marked “Confidential” to the Board of Directors, Provident Financial\nHoldings, Inc., 3756 Central Avenue, Riverside, California 92506. Any communication must state the number of shares beneficially owned by the shareholder initiating\nthe communication.\nAnnual Meeting Attendance by Directors. We do not have a policy regarding Board member attendance at the annual meetings of shareholders. All members\nof the Board of Directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.\n11\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions. During the year ended June 30, 2024, neither Provident nor Provident Savings Bank participated in any\ntransactions, or proposed transactions, in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any related person had a direct or indirect material interest.\nShareholder Engagement. Management and the Board of Directors believe that effective corporate governance should include communication with shareholders\nand responsiveness to shareholder concerns. In July 2024, we began our fifth shareholder engagement program, sending a corporate governance questionnaire to our 15\nlargest shareholders representing approximately 50% of Provident's outstanding shares at the time. We did not receive any responses from the shareholders contacted. We\nasked the following questions and stated in the cover letter that responses would be reviewed by the Board of Directors:\n• Is there any information in our public filings we do not provide that would be helpful for your assessment of our company?\n• Do you have any concerns with Provident's alignment of company performance with executive pay?\n• Do you have any concerns with the calculation of severance payments for executive officers in connection with a change in control?\n• If there are concerns in response to Bullet Points 2 or 3, are there specific recommendations, strategies, or practices you would like to see considered?\n• Do our corporate governance practices meet your expectations?\n• Is our Board structure appropriate?\n• We believe we have implemented solid internal control and audit functions within the company. Do you have any concerns with our audit practices?\n• Do you have any other suggestions as it pertains to corporate governance or other practices that would be helpful to management or the Board? Your\ncomments, suggestions and feedback will be shared with the Board of Directors.\nOur shareholder engagement program did not result in any responses this year, however, from time to time, Provident’s management may meet with shareholders\nat investor conferences or at our administrative offices, or may have telephone calls and emails with shareholders. Corporate governance matters are sometimes discussed.\nAfter these interactions, the non-executive Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer apprise the Board of Directors of the substance of these meetings to keep\nthem informed of shareholder concerns. Directors welcome direct communication with shareholders, as discussed in the Shareholder Communication with the Board of\nDirectors section of this Proxy Statement.\nDuring the past fiscal year, in the meetings we held with shareholders, we specifically inquired about our executive compensation practices as a result of last\nyear’s low approval percentage on the shareholder say-on-pay vote. We outlined for meeting participants that the Section 280G Internal Revenue Code definition of base\nsalary has been modified to exclude gains on equity awards (stock option exercise and stock award vesting) in the change in control section of the employment agreement\nwith the new President and Chief Executive Officer. We also described that the prior Chief Executive Officer’s legacy employment agreement containing the prior Section\n280G Internal Revenue Code definition of base salary including gains on equity awards was rescinded on January 1, 2024. In addition, we discussed that we believe the\npay for performance evaluations conducted by the proxy advisory firms generally found alignment of our Chief Executive Officer pay and company performance in\ncomparison to the derived peer group selected by the proxy advisory firms. In the meetings we held and after significant discussion, there were no material compensation\nconcerns expressed regarding our executive compensation policies. This has also been our historical experience when discussing executive compensation with\nshareholders, but we are not satisfied with the low approval percentage of the\n12\npast say-on-pay votes and will continue to prioritize executive compensation as a discussion point in our shareholder interactions and would invite shareholders to contact\nus on this matter.\nAnother important topic that was raised by a shareholder during one of these meetings is the expectation that executive officers and directors have significant\nstock ownership in Provident. We pointed out the stock ownership policy and retention guidelines that we adopted in June 2021 and that approximately 15 percent of our\noutstanding common stock is held by all executive officers and directors as a group as disclosed in the October 26, 2023 Proxy Statement. After this discussion, the\nshareholder was satisfied with our policy, guidelines, and executive officer and director ownership.\nIn past years, shareholders wanted to understand our approach to the much-discussed environmental, social and governance initiatives, commonly referred to as\nESG. We described that we have a long history of complying with regulatory requirements and we would do so for any ESG rules and regulations that may be adopted by\nany of our regulators. We also explained that we are defined as a smaller reporting company under many Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and would\nfulfill any ESG regulatory requirements as a smaller reporting company which may include less rigorous regulatory criteria for compliance in contrast to non-smaller\nreporting companies. The shareholders did not express any concerns with our approach.\nWe have also been asked about our views regarding mergers and acquisitions and have responded that the members of the Board of Directors take their fiduciary\nduties seriously. The Board has established a long range planning committee to consider such matters and at least annually hosts presentations from investment banking\nprofessionals describing the current and future operating environment which includes segments on mergers and acquisitions, fundamental drivers of creating shareholder\nvalue, the California banking landscape, and an assessment of the Provident franchise, among other topics. The Board of Directors is open to all discussions that will\nenhance franchise and shareholder value. We were strongly encouraged to consider such matters earnestly and we intend to do so.\nIn the past we have been asked about the average age and tenure of directors. We described our belief that continuity of leadership is an important factor to\nimplement long term strategies and that long term institutional knowledge, including during poor economic conditions such as recessions, provides experience when\ndealing with challenging banking conditions and adverse economic cycles. We also recognize that refreshing leadership is important and would point out that last year we\nnominated and shareholders elected two new independent candidates with outstanding qualifications to replace two retiring directors and three years ago shareholders\nelected a new independent director with outstanding qualifications in preparation for an impending retirement.\nHedging and Pledging Policy. Provident prohibits its directors and senior officers from purchasing financial instruments, or otherwise engaging in transactions,\nthat hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of Provident’s equity securities. Provident also prohibits its directors and senior\nfinancial officers from holding Provident securities in a margin account or pledging Provident securities as collateral for a loan.\nStock Ownership Policy and Retention Guidelines\nIn 2021, we adopted stock ownership guidelines for our directors and senior officers to encourage them to build their ownership position in our common stock\nover time. The guidelines are framed in terms of stock value as a percentage of the base cash retainer or base salary.\nPosition Stock Value as a Percentage of the Base Cash Retainer or Base Salary\nDirector 300%\nChief Executive Officer 300%\nPresident 200%\nSenior Officer 100%\nFor incumbent directors and senior officers, the closing price of Provident’s stock on June 30, 2021 and the person’s ownership position on that date will be used for the\npurposes of determining compliance with the stock ownership guidelines and to begin the five-year timeline to achieve compliance. As of June 30, 2024, all directors and\nsenior\n13\nofficers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. For new directors and senior officers, the date appointed to the Board of Directors, the employment date,\nor the promotion date will be used to establish the stock ownership threshold and begin the five-year timeline to achieve compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.\nUnder the stock ownership guidelines, once a director or senior officer attains his or her individual ownership level, he or she will remain in compliance with these\nguidelines despite future changes in the stock price, base cash retainer, or base salary, as long as his or her holdings do not decline below the recommended number of\nshares at the time the stock ownership guidelines were met. Shares counted toward the guidelines include those held by the executive directly or through a broker, shares\nheld in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, in-the-money unexercised exercisable stock options, and unvested restricted stock.\nWe have adopted stock retention guidelines for our directors and senior officers. Each director or executive is required to retain 50% of the net shares (after\npayment of the applicable exercise price (if any), fees, and taxes) acquired upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock. The director or executive is\nrequired to hold such shares until the date that he or she satisfies our stock ownership guidelines; shares may not be sold if they would cause the director or executive\nofficer to not meet the stock retention guidelines. Exceptions may apply for donations of stock to charities, educational institutions or family foundations and for sales or\ndivisions of property in the case of divorce, disability or death. Waivers may be granted in exceptional circumstances.\nCompensation Recovery Policy. Effective November 28, 2023, the Board of Directors adopted the Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. Compensation Recovery\nPolicy in accordance with the applicable rules of Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act and Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5608, to provide for the recovery of certain incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement of Provident’s financial statements due to material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current\nperiod or left uncorrected in the current period. The policy applies to Provident’s current and former executive officers, including the named executive officers, and is\nadministered by the Personnel/Compensation Committee.\n14\nDIRECTORS’ COMPENSATION\nThe following table shows the compensation paid to our directors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, with the exception of Craig G. Blunden, who is our non-\nexecutive Chairman and served as Chief Executive Officer until January 2, 2024, and whose compensation is included in the section entitled “Executive Compensation.”\nDirectors did not receive non-equity incentive compensation or nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, nor do they have pensions; therefore, these columns have\nbeen omitted from the table below.\nFees Earned All Other\nor Paid in Stock Awards Option Compensation\nName Cash ($) ($)(1) Awards ($)(1) ($)(2) Total ($)\nJudy A.

For Mr. Taylor, also includes a lump-sum payment of\n$143,623 to retire the Bank’s obligation of lifetime medical, dental, and vision care benefits.\n(3) Mr. Bennett passed away on October 22, 2023.\n(4) Mr. Taylor retired effective as of November 28, 2023.\nNon-employee directors of Provident currently receive a monthly retainer of $3,000, a fee of $400 for each committee meeting attended and a fee of $1,000 for\neach special board meeting attended. The committee chairman receives a fee of $500 per committee meeting attended. Effective January 1, 2024, directors are no longer\ncovered under the Bank’s policies for medical, dental and vision care. Prior to January 1, 2024, directors were covered under the Bank’s policies for medical, dental, and\nvision care. Dependent coverage was available at the directors’ own expense. No separate fees are paid for service on Provident Savings Bank’s Board of Directors.\nEmployee directors receive no separate compensation for their services.\n15\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee. The Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Provident and Provident Savings Bank Boards of Directors is responsible\nfor establishing and implementing all compensation policies of Provident, Provident Savings Bank and its subsidiaries. The Committee is also responsible for evaluating\nthe performance of the Chief Executive Officer and approving an appropriate compensation level. The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of all senior\nofficers and recommends to the Committee individual compensation levels for approval by the Committee.\nObjectives and Overview of the Compensation Program. The Personnel/Compensation Committee believes that a compensation program for executive\nofficers should take into account management skills, long-term performance results and shareholder returns. The principles underlying our compensation policies are:\n• to attract and retain key executives who are highly qualified and are vital to the long-term success of Provident and its subsidiaries;\n• to provide levels of compensation competitive with those offered throughout the banking industry;\n• to align the interests of executives with shareholders by having a significant portion of total compensation based on meeting defined performance\nmeasures;\n• to motivate executives to enhance long-term shareholder value by helping them build their own ownership in Provident; and\n• to integrate the compensation program with the Bank’s long-term strategic planning and management process.\nThe Committee considers a variety of subjective and objective factors in determining the compensation package for individual executives including: (1) the\nperformance of Provident and Provident Savings Bank on a consolidated basis with emphasis on annual performance factors and long-term objectives; (2) the\nresponsibilities assigned to each executive; and (3) the performance of each executive of assigned responsibilities as measured by the progress of Provident and Provident\nSavings Bank during the year.\nCompensation Consultant. The Personnel/Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation advisers. Although the Committee has not\nretained a compensation consultant in recent years, it engaged a firm to assist it with matters related to the adoption of the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan. The Committee\nasked the firm to review the draft plan and description of the plan included in the Proxy Statement, and provide relevant market data and analysis to help evaluate the draft\nplan within the context of industry practices. The firm was retained by, and reported directly to, the Personnel/Compensation Committee, and provided no other services to\nProvident. Prior to engaging the firm, the Committee assessed its independence as required by Nasdaq rules and concluded that the firm was independent. The Committee\nreviewed and considered information provided to it by the firm and based on its review and such factors as it deemed relevant, the Committee concluded that the\ninformation it received was objective and did not raise any conflicts of interest.\nCompensation Program Elements. The Personnel/Compensation Committee focuses primarily on the following three components in forming the total\ncompensation package for our executive officers:\n• base salary;\n• annual incentive compensation; and\n• long-term equity-based compensation.\n16\nThe current compensation program involves a combination of salary, at-risk incentives to reward short-term performance, and stock option and restricted stock awards to\nreward long-term performance. The Personnel/Compensation Committee monitors the allocation of compensation between long-term and currently paid items on an\nongoing basis, with the goal of ensuring that the allocation is competitive in the banking industry.\nBase Salary. Base salary is intended to reward the executive’s ongoing performance and is based on the executive’s level of responsibility, individual ability,\nexperience, and past and potential performance. The salary levels of our executive officers are designed to be competitive with those of executives at similarly-sized\nbanking institutions in our geographic area which have similar operations and performance. Individual annual performance is reviewed by the Personnel/Compensation\nCommittee or the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to determine annual salary adjustments. An executive may receive a material increase in salary upon taking on\nmaterially larger duties and responsibilities. Compensation information is obtained by reviewing proxy statements and various compensation surveys including the S&P\nGlobal Market Intelligence Compensation data, the American Bankers Association Compensation Survey Report, the California Bankers Association Survey and the\nEmployers Group Survey, among others. From these sources, the Personnel/Compensation Committee and the Chief Executive Officer create a compensation framework\nand set executive officer compensation based on the range of base salaries and bonuses paid, and equity awards granted, by peer companies.\nAnnual Incentive Compensation. Incentive compensation is intended to reward short-term performance goals, keeping compensation aligned with goals that\ntypically improve shareholder returns. The annual incentive plan is based on Provident’s annual performance compared to the business plan and individual performance\nrequirements. Each year, management prepares and the Board of Directors approves a one-year and three-year business plan, which establish strategic goals and objectives\nfor Provident and each division of Provident. Each executive is responsible for his or her specific goals and the objectives outlined in the business plan, which is monitored\nthrough the use of individual action plans. Executives are graded each year on their successful completion of the action plans.\nThe annual incentive plan is designed to provide for a baseline bonus up to 50% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, up to 25% of salary for senior officers,\nup to 12% of salary for certain managers (other than department managers) and up to 8% of salary for certain department managers. Actual bonuses may exceed the\nbaseline if Provident performs better than the business plan and/or the individual employee performs better than the individual performance requirements. The business\nplan outlines a number of performance goals such as net income, return on assets, return on equity, efficiency ratio and diluted earnings per share, among others. Individual\nperformance requirements are project related and consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the particular employee. The Personnel/Compensation Committee may\nuse its discretion to modify a particular award or an individual’s performance requirements, although it has not typically done so.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, the named executive officers had the following performance goals:\nFiscal 2024\nThreshold Target Maximum Actual\nNet income $8,300,000 $10,375,000 $15,562,000 $7,351,000\nReturn on average assets 0.61% 0.76% 1.15% 0.57%\nReturn on average equity 6.37% 7.97% 11.95% 5.62%\nEfficiency ratio 70.18% 65.59% 56.36% 73.44%\nDiluted earnings per share $1.18 $1.48 $2.22 $1.06\n17\nUnder the annual incentive plan, bonuses are calculated as a percentage of base salary. Mr. Blunden’s eligible base salary was reduced by 50% in connection with\nhis retirement as Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2024. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, participation levels for the named executive officers expressed as a\npercentage of base salary at July 1, 2023 at each performance level were as follows:\nThreshold (%) Target (%) Maximum (%)\nCraig G. Blunden 20.0 50.0 93.8\nDonavon P. Ternes 20.0 50.0 93.8\nDavid S. Weiant 10.0 25.0 46.9\nTamHao B. Nguyen 10.0 25.0 46.9\nWe adopted clawback and compensation recovery policies which reserves the right of the Board to modify any incentive compensation agreement before the final\nbonus amount is determined. Additionally, we may seek to recover incentive compensation paid if any of the following are discovered: (1) unreasonable risk-taking by the\nemployee, (2) risk-taking by the employee not specifically approved by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board, (3) actions or omissions by the employee in conflict with\nour policies and procedures, or (4) in the event our financial statements are subject to restatement, to the extent permitted by governing law.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation is intended to attract and retain qualified personnel and nonemployee directors, to provide these persons\nwith a proprietary interest in Provident as an incentive to contribute to our success and to reward personnel for outstanding performance. Equity-based compensation\nfunctions as a long-term incentive because awards are generally made with a multiple-year vesting schedule. Awards are made either in the form of stock options or\nrestricted stock.\nThe equity-based plans are administered and interpreted by the Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Provident Savings Bank Board of Directors. Under the\nplans, the Committee determines which officers and key employees will receive awards, the number of shares subject to each option or shares of restricted stock awarded,\nand the vesting of the awards. The per share exercise price of an option will equal at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option\nis granted. Awards are made at the discretion of the Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, newly hired employees may receive awards at the\ntime of their employment. In determining whether to make option or restricted stock awards, the Personnel/Compensation Committee may take into account historical\nawards and then-current competitive conditions.\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee Report\nThe Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Boards of Directors of Provident and Provident Savings Bank has submitted the following report for inclusion in\nthis Proxy Statement:\nWe have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Proxy Statement with management. Based on the Committee’s\nreview of and the discussion with management with respect to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.\nThe foregoing report is provided by the following directors, who constitute the Personnel/Compensation Committee:\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee: William E. Thomas, Chairman\nDebbi H. Guthrie\nBrian N. Hawley\nThis report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.\n18\nCompensation Policies and Risk\nThe Personnel/Compensation Committee strives to develop compensation policies and practices that discourage excessive risk-taking, that focus our executives\nand employees on creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, and that provide appropriate levels of realized compensation over time. The\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee believes that our compensation policies and practices should provide a blend of cash and equity, and short-term and longer-term\nincentives. In addition, the Personnel/Compensation Committee, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer, establishes goals and objectives that require a\ncombination of individual, business unit and company-wide performance measures consistent with effective controls and sound risk management. The\nPersonnel/Compensation Committee reports periodically to the Board of Directors, seeks Board approval of certain significant compensation policies and practices, and\nmonitors changing market conditions that may influence the competitive landscape for attracting and retaining qualified executive management.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table shows information regarding compensation earned by our named executive officers, who are: (1) Donavon P. Ternes, our principal executive\nofficer; (2) David S. Weiant and TamHao B. Nguyen, our two next most highly compensated executive officers; and Craig G.

Provident Savings Bank entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ternes on October 26, 2023, which became effective with his\npromotion to Chief Executive Officer on January 2, 2024. The agreement has a term of three years and may be renewed by the Board for an additional year each year\nunless the Bank or Mr. Ternes has given written notice of their intention not to extend the term of the agreement at least 90 days prior to the anniversary date. Mr. Ternes’\ncurrent base salary under the agreement is $500,000 and is subject to annual review and approval by the Board. Mr. Ternes may also receive performance-based or\ndiscretionary bonuses, as authorized by the Board. Under the agreement, Mr. Ternes is eligible to participate in all benefit programs to the same extent as employees of the\nBank as well as any program made available to senior executives of the Bank, including a monthly automobile allowance. The agreement also provides for the\nreimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Ternes in the course of his employment. The agreement provides that compensation may be paid in the event of disability,\ndeath, involuntary termination or a change in control, as described below under “Potential Payments Upon Termination.”\nSeverance Agreements. We extended the existing change in control severance agreements with Mr. Weiant and Ms. Nguyen effective as of March 1, 2024. The\nagreements have a term of one year, which may be extended for an additional year on the anniversary of the effective date of the agreement by the Board of Directors. The\nagreements provide for compensation in the event of an involuntary termination, other than for cause, within 12 months following a change in control of Provident or\nProvident Savings Bank, as described under “Potential Payments Upon Termination.”\nTransition Agreement. Provident and Provident Savings Bank entered into a Transition Agreement with Mr. Blunden in connection with his transition from\nserving as Chief Executive Officer to becoming non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of both Provident and Provident Savings Bank, effective January 2,\n2024. As of January 1, 2024, Mr. Blunden’s employment agreement with respect to his employment as Chief Executive Officer terminated and he is entitled to no further\npayments under that agreement. For his services as non-executive Chairman of Provident, Mr. Blunden receives a $3,700 monthly retainer. He is not compensated for\nperforming services as non-executive Chairman of the Bank, but receives compensation for his committee member services.\nThe Transition Agreement will remain in effect for as long as Mr. Blunden remains a non-employee director of Provident. During the transition agreement term,\nMr. Blunden will be reimbursed for reasonable and customary expenses incurred in connection with serving as non-executive Chairman, including monthly club dues, the\nbusiness portion of his monthly club expenses, approved business travel to conferences and approved industry memberships. During the term, he also will be eligible to\nparticipate in any benefit, fringe benefit, and equity compensation plan available to directors generally, but will be personally responsible for paying his and his family’s\nmedical, dental, life, tax preparation fees and costs. He also will have use of an automobile and office space, each as appropriate considering his position as non-executive\nChairman. In addition, the Bank will transfer to Mr. Blunden Provident’s membership interest in a country club, which has an estimated value of $5,000.\nClawback Provision.

The agreements provide that if the\nexecutive terminates employment with the Bank after attaining age 62, the Bank will provide the executive with a monthly benefit for life equal to 50% of his final average\nmonthly salary. The agreement also provides for early retirement benefits and payments in the event of the executive’s death or disability. These payments are described\nbelow under “Potential Payments Upon Termination.”\n22\nPotential Payments Upon Termination\nWe have entered into agreements with the named executive officers that provide for potential payments upon disability, termination, retirement and death. In\naddition, our equity plans also provide for potential payments upon termination.

Does not reflect the impact of any deferrals in the payment of the cash severance to\npreserve the deductibility of such severance under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, with interest equal to 8% per annum to be paid on the amounts\ndeferred as described below. The payments and benefits to Mr. Ternes in the event of a change in control will be reduced by the minimum amount necessary so that\nthey do not trigger the 20% excise tax imposed by Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any required reduction is not reflected in the above table. If\nthe timing of the change in control permitted tax planning to be done, we believe that the amount of any cutbacks that may be triggered in the future could be reduced\nor even eliminated.\n(2) Represents the monthly benefit to the executive or his spouse for life. The lifetime benefits will be discounted to present value and paid in a lump sum.\n(3) Represents the value of unvested restricted stock awards held by the executive based on the June 28, 2024 closing price of $12.50 per share.\nEmployment Agreement. Mr. Ternes’ employment agreement provides for potential payments in the event of his disability, death or termination. If Mr. Ternes\nbecomes entitled to benefits under the terms of the then-current disability plan, if any, of Provident Savings Bank or becomes otherwise unable to fulfill his duties under his\nemployment agreement, he shall be entitled to receive such group and other disability benefits as are then provided by the Bank for executive employees. In the event of\nhis disability, the employment agreement will not be suspended, except that the obligation to pay his salary will be reduced in accordance with the amount of disability\nincome benefits he receives such that, on an after-tax basis, he will realize from the sum of disability income benefits and the salary the same amount as he would realize\non an after-tax basis from the salary if the obligation to pay the salary were not reduced, provided that if Mr. Ternes is 65 years of age or older, the obligation to pay his\nsalary shall be discontinued for as long as he is disabled.\nIn the event of Mr. Ternes’ death or disability while employed under the employment agreement and prior to any termination of employment, the Bank shall pay to\nhim or his estate, or such person as he may have previously designated, the salary which was not previously paid to him and which he would have earned if he had\ncontinued to be\n23\nemployed under the agreement through the last day of the calendar month in which he died or became disabled, together with the benefits provided under the employment\nagreement through that date.\nIn the event of Mr. Ternes’ death or disability, or in the event of his normal retirement, the Bank shall continue to provide the following benefits to him or his\nestate, as applicable: (1) the Bank shall continue in force, without cost to Mr. Ternes, those life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverages being\nprovided by the Bank to Mr. Ternes and his spouse and his eligible dependents as of the date of such termination, provided that such coverages after Mr. Ternes’ 65th\nbirthday may be reduced to reflect any decreases which would have occurred if he had continued to remain employed after his 65th birthday (as determined under the\nBank’s coverage schedules for such insurance in place as of the date of such termination); (2) the Bank shall continue to provide to Mr. Ternes and his eligible dependents\nmedical insurance coverage equivalent in benefits, duration and terms to that provided to him and such persons as of the date of such termination; and (3) the Bank shall\ncontinue to reimburse Mr. Ternes for the expenses outlined in Section 4(c) of his employment agreement, which includes club dues.\nThe employment agreement also provides for benefits in the event of Mr. Ternes’ involuntary termination. If Mr. Ternes’ employment is terminated for any reason\nother than cause, death, permanent disability, retirement or change in control, or Mr. Ternes terminates his own employment because of a material diminution of or\ninterference with his duties, responsibilities or benefits, he is entitled to payment and benefits. Specifically, the Bank must make a lump sum payment equal to the\ndiscounted present value of the aggregate future base salary payments Mr. Ternes would have received over the then remaining term of the agreement.\nIf Mr. Ternes’ employment is terminated within 12 months following a change in control of Provident, or he terminates his own employment within 12 months\nfollowing a change in control for any of the reasons listed in the previous paragraph, the Bank must pay him a lump sum equal to 299% of his base amount (as defined in\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, except that “base amount” shall be determined by excluding gains attributable to compensation related to equity awards\nprovided by Provident) and must provide during the remaining term of the employment agreement substantially the same group life insurance, hospitalization, medical,\ndental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance (if any) for the benefit of Mr. Ternes and his dependents and beneficiaries who would\nhave been eligible for such benefits if he had not suffered involuntary termination. However, if the value of the lump sum and benefits described in the preceding sentence\nexceeds the amount that could be paid without violating Section 280G (pertaining to golden parachute payments), taking into account other payments due Mr. Ternes in\nconnection with a change in control and other amounts counted against the Section 280G limit, then the value of such lump sum and benefits shall be reduced so that\nSection 280G is not violated.\nMr. Ternes’ employment agreement provides that if Mr. Ternes’ aggregate compensation from the Bank exceeds the maximum amount of compensation deductible\nby the Bank in any calendar year under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “maximum allowable amount”), then any such amount in excess of the maximum\nallowable amount will be deferred with interest on the deferred amount at 8% annually to a calendar year such that the amount to be paid to Mr. Ternes in that year does not\nexceed the maximum allowable amount. Deferred amounts, including interest, will be paid at the earliest time permissible.\nSeverance Agreements. We extended the existing change in control severance agreements with Mr. Weiant and Ms. Nguyen effective as of March 1, 2024. The\nagreements have a term of one year, which may be extended for an additional year on the anniversary of the effective date of the agreement by the Board of Directors. If\nthe employment of the executive is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, within 12 months following a change in control of Provident or Provident Savings Bank,\nor the executive terminates his or her own employment within 12 months following a change in control because of any demotion, loss of title, office or significant\nauthority, reduction in the executive’s annual compensation or benefits, or relocation of the executive’s principal place of employment more than 35 miles from the pre-\nchange in control location, the executive would be entitled to payment and benefits. The agreements provide that the Bank must pay a lump sum payment equal to two\ntimes the executive’s then current base salary and a lump sum payment equal to two times the largest annual bonus paid to the executive during the two years prior to\ntermination of employment. The Bank or its successor also would be obligated to continue the executive’s life, medical, dental and disability coverage for a two-year period\nfollowing termination of employment.\n24\nPost-Retirement Compensation Agreement. Provident Savings Bank entered into a post-retirement compensation agreement with Mr. Ternes as of July 7, 2009\nand a post-retirement compensation agreement with Mr. Blunden, which was amended on December 15, 2005. The agreements provide that if Mr. Ternes and Mr. Blunden\nterminate employment with the Bank after having attained age 62 (which both have attained), or on account of death, disability or involuntary termination, the Bank will\npay the executive a lump sum amount equal in value to a stream of payments, payable over the executive’s life, the annual amount of which is 50% of the executive’s final\naverage monthly salary (reduced in the case of disability by amounts received by the executive from any long-term disability policies maintained by the Bank). For\npurposes of the agreements, “final average monthly salary” is defined as the average of the executive’s highest paid 36 months of employment with the Bank determined by\nreference to the average gross amount of his basic monthly salary (before tax withholding and other payroll deductions), excluding bonus or incentive awards, director fees,\nif any, and accelerated payments of future salary. The value of this lump sum benefit is calculated using National Association of Insurance Commissioners standard\nmortality tables as of such date, and a discount rate equal to the lesser of the then-current prime rate or the Freddie Mac Enterprise 11th District COFI Replacement Index –\nConsumer Products (Single-Family).\nEquity Plans. Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of awards in the event of a change in control. If a\nchange in control occurs prior to the vesting of an award, the vesting date will be accelerated to the effective date of the change in control. The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan\nand the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of awards in the event of a change in control and involuntary termination of the award recipient within\n12 months of the change in control. The 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan\nalso provide that if an award recipient’s employment terminates due to death or disability prior to the vesting of an award, the vesting date will be accelerated to the date of\ntermination of service.\n25\nPay Versus Performance\nIn August 2022 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), the SEC adopted Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K, requiring information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to our named executive officers and Provident’s financial\nperformance.\nValue of\nAverage Initial Fixed\nSummary Compensa- Summary Compensa- Summary Average $100\nCompensa- tion Compensa- tion Compensa- Compensa- Investment\ntion Table Actually tion Table Actually tion Table tion Based on\nTotal for Paid to Total for Paid to Total for Actually Total\nPEO PEO PEO PEO Non-PEO Paid to Shareholder\n(Ternes) (Ternes) (Blunden) (Blunden) NEOs Non-PEO Return Net Income\nYear ($)(1) ($)(2) ($)(1) ($)(2) ($)(1) NEOs ($)(2) ($)(3) ($)\n2024 804,353 804,233 603,230 604,230 414,762 414,260 81.48 7,351,000\n2023 -- -- 951,054 905,454 570,174 537,129 79.56 8,592,000\n2022 -- -- 561,638 533,738 353,801 333,573 88.86 9,093,000\n(1) During the year ended June 30, 3024, Craig G.

This proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the\ncompensation of Provident’s executives as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the following resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Provident’s named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, the compensation tables and related material in Provident’s Proxy Statement for the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders.\nThis vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Personnel/Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or\ncreate or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board. It will also not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive. The Personnel/Compensation\nCommittee and the Board may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.\nThe purpose of our compensation policies is to attract and retain key executives who are highly qualified and vital to our long-term success, while aligning the\ninterests of executives with shareholders. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\nbelieves that the executive compensation for 2024 is reasonable and appropriate and is justified by Provident’s performance in a highly competitive environment. In\nconsidering how to vote on this proposal, the Board requests that you consider the following factors:\n• The Bank must offer competitive compensation packages to attract and retain well-qualified executives who are critical to Provident’s long-term success.\n• The compensation program entails a balanced approach that considers the short-term and long-term interests of shareholders and safe and sound banking\npractices.\n• The compensation program does not encourage excessive and unnecessary risks that would threaten the value of Provident.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy\nStatement.\n28\nAUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS\nAudit Committee Charter.
