Our outlook for GAAP total operating expenses is $1.86 billion to $1.96 billion, including a $10 million regulatory accrual in Q3 2024.\n\nOur outlook for Non-GAAP combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2024 is unchanged at $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion.\n\nActual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.\n\n**About Robinhood**\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc.

The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of Robinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we,” “Robinhood,” or the “Company”) and our strategic and operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that index options, futures, and a realized profit and loss tool are coming soon; that we have a ton of momentum, and we’re just getting started; that in July 2024, we began executing on our authorized $1 billion share repurchase program, which we continue to expect to complete over a total of two to three years; that we will launch futures and index options in the coming months with some of the lowest contract fees in the industry; that we received Financial Conduct Authority approval to offer options trading in the UK and plan to launch in 2025; and all statements and information under the headings “Financial Outlook” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Outlook.” Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believe,” “may,” “will” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our limited operating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (“PFOF”), and the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into some of our products and processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on October 31, 2024, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, all of which are available on the SEC’s web site at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, October 30, 2024 and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss) and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.\n\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income (loss) divided by total net revenues). We believe Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\n\n_Adjusted Operating Expenses_\n\nAdjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. We believe Adjusted Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\n\n_Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC_\n\nAdjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves and (ii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC. We believe Adjusted Operating Expense and SBC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\n\n_Funded Customers_\n\nWe define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer.\n\n_Assets Under Custody (“AUC”)_\n\nWe define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.\n\n_Net Deposits_\n\nWe define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms (assets transferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet transfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.\n\n_Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)_\n\nWe define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.\n\n_Gold Subscribers_\n\nWe define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.\n\n**Additional Operating Metrics**\n\n_Retirement AUC_\n\nWe define Retirement AUC as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.\n\n_Cash Sweep_\n\nWe define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.\n\n_Margin Book_\n\nWe define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\n\n_Notional Trading Volume_\n\nWe define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.\n\n_Options Contracts Traded_\n\nWe define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\n\n_Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\")_\n\nWe define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood entity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar month: a) executes a debit card or credit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their account or c) loads a page in a web browser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these conditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this release reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many customers interact with our products and services during a given month. MAU does not measure the frequency or duration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively correlated with, but are not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.\n\n**Glossary Terms**\n\n_Investment Accounts_\n\nWe define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, or a funded individual retirement account (\"IRA\"). As of September 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to four Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July 2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\n\n_Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits_\n\nWhen used with respect to Net Deposits, “growth rate” and “annualized growth rate” provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. “Growth rate” is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. “Annualized growth rate” is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding quarter.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NDc1MCM2NTU3NDEzIzIyMDYyNDA=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDVhY2RjN2QtZTY1Yi00YzNmLWE3NDMtZDQxYTg5NzMwODUxLTEyMTc3OTM=/tiny/Robinhood-Markets-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0c13ddea-b824-48cd-8eec-4af2003cf1ba/small/rh-logo-rgb-green-101019-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0c13ddea-b824-48cd-8eec-4af2003cf1ba)\n\nSource: Robinhood Markets, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.robinhood.com/pressreleases/default.aspx)\n\n### Sign up for email alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Our outlook for GAAP total operating expenses is\n$1.86 billion to $1.96 billion, including a $10 million regulatory accrual in Q3 2024.\nOur outlook for Non-GAAP combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2024 is\nunchanged at $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion.\nActual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in\nFunded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree\nto which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting\nexpenses efficiently, among other factors. The above expense outlook does not include potential significant\nregulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business\nacquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required,\nas we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including\nsignificant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total\noperating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.\n2\nAbout Robinhood\nRobinhood Markets, Inc.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses\nand SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses\n(GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.\n9\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we,” “Robinhood,” or the “Company”) and our strategic\nand operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that index options, futures, and a realized\nprofit and loss tool are coming soon; that we have a ton of momentum, and we’re just getting started; that in July\n2024, we began executing on our authorized $1 billion share repurchase program, which we continue to expect to\ncomplete over a total of two to three years; that we will launch futures and index options in the coming months with\nsome of the lowest contract fees in the industry; that we received Financial Conduct Authority approval to offer\noptions trading in the UK and plan to launch in 2025; and all statements and information under the headings\n“Financial Outlook” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Outlook.” Forward-looking statements\ngenerally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify\nforward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believe,” “may,” “will” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”\n“anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the\nnegative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or\nintentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties,\nassumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ\nmaterially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be\nconsidered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-\nlooking statements include, among others: our limited operating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of\nmanaging our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or\nnegative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on\ntransaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (“PFOF”), and the risk of new regulation or bans on\nPFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate\nenvironments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and\nobjectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-\nregulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on\nbehalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing\nfunctions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic,\nor political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business;\nour dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex,\nand changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified\nlaws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the\neffects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in\norder to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance\non third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures\ncould impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and\nother online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a\nregulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management\ninfrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into some of our products\nand processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services\ncould be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock\nin the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some\nof these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not\nrely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and\nuncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on October 31, 2024, as well as in our other\nfilings with the SEC, all of which are available on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. Moreover, we operate in a\nvery competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and\nit is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our\nforward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in\nthe forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date\nof this press release, October 30, 2024 and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot\nguarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no\nobligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future\nevents, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our\nactual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.\n10\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our\nresources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss) and other results under\nGAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(“Adjusted EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses\nand SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should\nnot be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may\nbe different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP\nmeasures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP\nare provided in the financial tables included in this release.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities,\n(ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax\nsettlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring\ncharges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing\nresults.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in\nnature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of\noperations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of\noperations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance.\nMoreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating\ndecisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and\nannual budgeting.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income (loss) divided by total net revenues). We\nbelieve Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and\nevaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our\nbusiness performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is used by our management internally to make operating\ndecisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and\nannual budgeting.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses\nAdjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) significant\nlegal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring\ncharges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing\nexpenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of\noperations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. We believe Adjusted Operating Expenses\nprovides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as\nwell as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating\nExpenses is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating\nexpenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses and SBC\nAdjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) significant\nlegal and tax settlements and reserves and (ii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring\ncharges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our\nongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results,\nof operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses,\n11\nAdjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC. We believe Adjusted Operating Expense and SBC\nprovides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as\nwell as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating\nExpenses and SBC is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to\noperating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\nKey Performance Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we\nuse the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business,\nformulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nFunded Customers\nWe define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity\nand, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts\nthat are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or\n(b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which\nlaunched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer.\nAssets Under Custody (“AUC”)\nWe define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in\ntheir accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits\nand net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.\nNet Deposits\nWe define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends,\ninterest, and cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and\nretirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash\nwithdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms (assets\ntransferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and\ncustodial crypto wallet transfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not\ninclude inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024,\nNet Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees\nand margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was\nimmaterial.\nAverage Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)\nWe define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers\non the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this release represent\nARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.\nGold Subscribers\nWe define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and\nwho, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one\nRobinhood Gold subscription fee payment.\n12\nAdditional Operating Metrics\nRetirement AUC\nWe define Retirement AUC as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.\nCash Sweep\nWe define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the\nperiod-end total amount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or\nmoved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-\nbalance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate\noffered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.\nMargin Book\nWe define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the\nperiod-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a\npledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\nNotional Trading Volume\nWe define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase\nprice or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.\nOptions Contracts Traded\nWe define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a\nspecified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\nMonthly Active Users (\"MAU\")\nWe define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood\nentity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar month: a) executes a debit card or\ncredit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their\naccount or c) loads a page in a web browser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these\nconditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this\nrelease reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many\ncustomers interact with our products and services during a given month. MAU does not measure the frequency or\nduration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively\ncorrelated with, but are not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.\nGlossary Terms\nInvestment Accounts\nWe define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing\naccount, or a funded individual retirement account (\"IRA\"). As of September 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have\nup to four Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July\n2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\nGrowth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits\nWhen used with respect to Net Deposits, “growth rate” and “annualized growth rate” provide information\nabout Net Deposits relative to total AUC. “Growth rate” is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12\nmonth period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. “Annualized\ngrowth rate” is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the\nimmediately preceding quarter.\n13"

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements\nbecause they contain words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that\nconcern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from\nany future results expressed or implied in this presentation and the related webcast. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our limited\noperating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on\ntransaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (“PFOF”), and the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to\nprovide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf\nof customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a\nsystemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and\nregulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their\nengagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches,\nand other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating artificial\nintelligence technologies into some of our products and processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in\nthe public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of\nfuture events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on October 31, 2024, as well as in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), all of which are available on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and\nrapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results\ncould differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements in this presentation and the related webcast are made as of the date of this presentation and the related webcast, October 30, 2024, and are based\non information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no\nobligation to update any of the statements in this presentation and the related webcast whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should view this presentation and the related webcast with the understanding that our actual\nfuture results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.\nTrademarks\n\"Robinhood\" and the Robinhood feather logo are registered trademarks of Robinhood Markets, Inc.

As of September 30,\nWe define Retirement Assets Under Custody as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to four Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July 2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\nCash Sweep Net Cash Held by Users\nWe define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash We Define Net Cash Held by Users as cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users.\nthat has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount.\nRobinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms. New Funded Customers\nMargin Book We define a New Funded Customer as a unique person who became a Funded Customer for the first time during the relevant period.\nWe define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the Resurrected Customers\npurchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\nA Funded Customer is considered “Resurrected” in a stated period if it was a Churned Customer as of the end of the immediately preceding period and its balance (excluding amounts\nNotional Trading Volume that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) rises above zero or it completes a transaction using its account.\nWe define Notional Trading Volume or Notional Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that Revenue per Employee\nasset class over a specified period of time.\nRevenue per Employee is calculated by multiplying the quarterly total net revenues by four and dividing by average employee count for the quarter.\nOptions Contracts Traded\nTotal Securities Lending Revenue\nWe define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100\nshares of the underlying stock. Total Securities Lending Revenue includes net rebates and interest on cash collateral for both margin based and fully paid securities lending.\nMonthly Active Users (“MAU”)\nWe define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood entity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar\nmonth: a) executes a debit card or credit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their account or c) loads a page in a web\nbrowser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these conditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this\npresentation reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many customers interact with our products and services during a given\nmonth. MAU does not measure the frequency or duration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively correlated with, but\nare not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.\ninvestors.robinhood.com 44\nDefinitions (continued)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures SBC excluding the 2021 Founders Award Cancellation\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance.

(together with its subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “RHM”,\n“Robinhood”, or the “Company”) contains forward-looking statements (as such phrase is used in the federal securities laws), which involve\nsubstantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,”\n“plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these\nwords or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. This Quarterly Report includes, among\nothers, forward-looking statements regarding:\n• our expectations regarding legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations;\n• our intent to continue expanding our operations outside of the United States;\n• our expectations with respect to our pending acquisition of Bitstamp Ltd. (“Bitstamp”);\n• that if the improvements in our U.S. operating results continue, our belief that a reasonable probability exists that, within the next 24\nmonths, sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the U.S. valuation\nallowance would no longer be required;\n• the Repurchase Program (as defined below) and our current expectations with respect to timing; and\n• our belief that, based on our current level of operations, our primary sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current liquidity\nneeds for the next 12 months.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may\ncause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this Quarterly\nReport. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our\nforward-looking statements include, among others:\n• our limited operating experience at our current scale;\n• the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of declining or negative growth;\n• the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter;\n• our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (“PFOF”), and the implementation of new or proposed\nregulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices;\n• our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments;\n• the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if\nat all;\n• the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”);\n2\nTable of Contents\n• the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability\nfor processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions;\n• the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation;\n• the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event,\nmight harm our business;\n• our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce;\n• the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model\nin response to new or modified laws and regulations;\n• the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations;\n• the effects of competition;\n• our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and\ndeepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth;\n• our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair\nthe availability or stability of our platforms;\n• the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks;\n• the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws;\n• our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures;\n• the risks associated with incorporating artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies into some of our products and processes;\n• the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes;\n• the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and\n• the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause\nthe price of our stock to fall.\nBecause some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on\nour forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our\nbusiness and financial results is included in the section of this Quarterly Report titled “Risk Factors” and our other filings with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”), all of which are available on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. Moreover, we operate in a very\ncompetitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict\nall risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual\nresults could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements\nare made as of the date we file this Quarterly Report, and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we\nbelieve that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or\nachievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this Quarterly Report whether as\na result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this Quarterly Report with the\n3\nTable of Contents\nunderstanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.\nWe use the “Overview” tab of our Investor Relations website (accessible at investors.robinhood.com/overview) and its Newsroom,\n(accessible at newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com), as means of disclosing information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for\npurposes of the SEC’s Regulation Fair Disclosure (“Reg.

STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES\nRobinhood was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 22, 2013. Our most significant, wholly-owned subsidiaries are:\n• Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”), a registered introducing broker-dealer;\n• Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”), a registered clearing broker-dealer;\n• Robinhood Crypto, LLC (“RHC”), which provides users the ability to buy, sell, and transfer cryptocurrencies and is responsible for the\ncustody of user cryptocurrencies held by users on our RHC platform;\n• Robinhood Credit, Inc. (“Robinhood Credit”), which offers credit cards with certain rewards offerings; and\n• Robinhood Money, LLC, which offers a spending card and a spending account that help customers invest, save, and earn rewards.\nActing as the agent of the user, we facilitate the purchase and sale of options, cryptocurrencies, and equities through our platforms by\nrouting transactions through market makers, who are responsible for trade execution. Upon execution of a trade, users are legally required to\npurchase options, cryptocurrencies, or equities for cash from the transaction counterparty or to sell options, cryptocurrencies, or equities for cash\nto the transaction counterparty, depending on the transaction. We facilitate and confirm trades only when there are binding, matched legal\nobligations from the user and the market maker on both sides of the trade. Our users have ownership of the securities they transact on our\nplatforms, including those that collateralize margin loans, and, as a result, such securities are not presented on our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets, other than user-held fractional shares which are presented gross. Our users also have ownership of the\ncryptocurrencies they transact on our platforms (none of which are allowed to be purchased on margin and which do not serve as collateral for\nmargin loans), however, following our adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (“SAB 121”), we recognize a liability to reflect our\nsafeguarding obligation along with a corresponding asset on our balance sheet related to the cryptocurrencies we hold in custody for users.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited, and in management’s opinion, include all adjustments, including normal recurring\nadjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the periods\npresented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or any future\nperiod. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”).\nThere have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies as described in our audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in our 2023 Form 10-K, other than as disclosed below. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of RHM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation. The impact of these\nreclassifications is immaterial to the presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and had no\nimpact on previously reported total assets, total liabilities and net income (loss).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. We base our estimates on historical experience, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nAssumptions and estimates used in preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, those\nrelated to revenue recognition, share-based compensation (“SBC”), the determination of allowances for credit losses, valuation of user\ncryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and corresponding asset, investment valuation, capitalization of internally developed software, useful\nlives of property, software, and equipment, valuation and useful lives of intangible assets, incremental borrowing rate used to calculate operating\nlease right-of-use assets and related liabilities, impairment of long-lived assets, determination of hedge effectiveness, uncertain tax positions,\nincome taxes, accrued and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results.\nConcentrations of Revenue and Credit Risk\nConcentrations of Revenue\nWe derived transaction-based revenues from individual market makers in excess of 10% of total revenues, as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nMarket maker:\nCitadel Securities, LLC 11 % 14 % 12 % 13 %\nAll others individually less than 10% 26 % 36 % 28 % 37 %\nTotal as percentage of total revenue: 37 % 50 % 40 % 50 %\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which the counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks, and other\nfinancial institutions. In the event our counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. Default of a counterparty in equities and options trades, which are facilitated through clearinghouses, would\ngenerally be spread among the clearinghouse's members rather than falling entirely on us. It is our policy to review, as necessary, the credit\nstanding of each counterparty.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These\nevaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information,\namong other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and\nthat we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the\nparty that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the\nVIE;\n12\nTable of Contents\nand (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. We\ncontinuously monitor if any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity may impact the determination of whether we are still the primary\nbeneficiary and require us to revise our previous conclusion.\nAsset Acquisitions\nAcquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. We allocate the cost of the acquisition,\nincluding direct and incremental transaction costs, to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis.\nGoodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition.\nNOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThere were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially impacted our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-06, “Disclosure\nImprovements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative.” This amendment will impact\nvarious disclosure areas, including the statement of cash flows, accounting changes and error corrections, earnings per share, debt, equity,\nderivatives, and transfers of financial assets. The amendments in this guidance will be effective on the date the related disclosures are removed\nfrom Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K by the SEC, and will no longer be effective if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure\nrequirement by June 30, 2027. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the amendment on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures.” The amendments in guidance improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Income taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Taxes\nDisclosures.” This guidance requires annual disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provides additional information for\nreconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and\nrelated disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 34-99678 and No. 33-11275, “The Enhancement and Standardization of\nClimate-Related Disclosures for Investors” (the “Final Rules”), which requires registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their\nregistration statements and annual reports. The Final Rules require, among other things, disclosure in the notes to the audited financial\nstatements of the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, subject to certain thresholds, as well as amounts related to\ncarbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates in certain circumstances. The disclosure requirements of the Final Rules will begin\nphasing in\n13\nTable of Contents\nfor annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2025. In April 2024, the SEC stayed the effectiveness of the Final Rules. We are currently evaluating\nthe impact of the Final Rules.\nNOTE 3: REVENUES\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nTransaction-based revenues:\nOptions $ 124 $ 202 $ 384 $ 538\nCryptocurrencies 23 61 92 268\nEquities 27 37 79 116\nOther 11 19 30 53\nTotal transaction-based revenues 185 319 585 975\nNet interest revenues:\nMargin interest 67 83 177 228\nInterest on corporate cash and investments 75 67 217 203\nInterest on segregated cash, securities, and deposits 59 61 156 187\nCash Sweep 35 46 86 129\nSecurities lending, net 17 19 70 68\nCredit card, net 4 4 4 16\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities (6) (6) (17) (18)\nTotal net interest revenues 251 274 693 813\nOther revenues\nGold subscription revenues 20 28 55 77\nProxy revenues 8 8 53 53\nOther 3 8 8 19\nTotal other revenues $ 31 $ 44 $ 116 $ 149\nTotal net revenues $ 467 $ 637 $ 1,394 $ 1,937\nRobinhood Match Incentives\nWe offer a match incentive on customers’ eligible contributions to their retirement accounts and, from time to time, an incentive on other\ntransfers of assets to our platform. We also provide a match on eligible cash deposits made by Robinhood Gold users. The match on retirement\ncontributions and asset transfers are paid upfront and are subject to forfeiture if the recipient does not hold the contributed funds or transferred\nassets in their account for a specified period of time. These incentives are deferred and recognized over the specified holding period as a\nreduction to revenue. Match on eligible cash deposits are paid out on a monthly basis ratably over the specified earning period. Future match\npayments are forfeited if deposits are not held on the platform over the specified earning period. These matches are\n14\nTable of Contents\nrecognized as a reduction to revenue when earned. The matches are allocated to certain revenue categories on a proportional basis. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, no impairments were recognized.\nFully-Paid Securities Lending\nFor our fully-paid securities lending program under which we borrow fully-paid shares from participating users and lend them to third parties\n(“Fully-Paid Securities Lending”), we earn revenue for lending certain securities based on demand for those securities and portions of such\nrevenues are paid to participating users, and those payments are recorded as interest expense. The following table presents interest revenue\nearned and interest expense paid from Fully-Paid Securities Lending:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nInterest revenue $ 12 $ 20 $ 35 $ 60\nInterest expense (2) (3) (5) (9)\nFully-Paid Securities Lending, net $ 10 $ 17 $ 30 $ 51\nContract Balances\nContract receivables are recognized when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment under a contract and are\nderecognized when cash is received. Transaction-based revenue receivables due from market makers are reported in receivables from brokers,\ndealers, and clearing organizations while other revenue receivables related to proxy revenues due from issuers are reported in other current\nassets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities, which primarily consist of unearned subscription revenue, are recognized when users remit cash payments in advance of\nthe time we satisfy our performance obligations and are recorded as other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe table below sets forth contract receivables and liabilities for the period indicated:\n(in millions) Contract Receivables Contract Liabilities\nBeginning of the period, January 1, 2024 $ 87 $ 4\nEnd of the period, September 30, 2024 106 9\nChanges during the period $ 19 $ 5\nThe difference between the opening and ending balances of our contract receivables was primarily driven by higher transaction-based\nrevenues due to increased trading volumes and timing differences between our performance and counterparties’ payments. We recognized all\nrevenue from amounts included in the opening contract liabilities balance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 4: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS\nPending Acquisition of Bitstamp\nIn June 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding equity of Bitstamp, a globally-scaled cryptocurrency exchange with\nretail and institutional customers. The aggregate consideration to be paid by us is expected to be approximately $200 million, subject to\ncustomary purchase price adjustments\n15\nTable of Contents\nset forth in the agreement and payable in cash. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is\nexpected to close in the first half of 2025.\nAsset Acquisitions\nOn January 3, 2024, we acquired all outstanding stock of MNA Holdco LLC and its subsidiary Marex North America LLC (“MNA”) and\nlicenses held by MNA for approximately $3 million (net of cash acquired in the amount of $125 million), which was determined to be an asset\nacquisition. The license acquired was recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nNOTE 5: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Brokerage Related\nBrokerage related allowance for credit losses primarily relate to unsecured balances of receivables from users due to Fraudulent Deposit\nTransactions, losses on margin lending, and reserves on proxy revenue receivables. Fraudulent Deposit Transactions occur when users initiate\ndeposits into their accounts, make trades on our platforms using a short-term extension of credit from us, and then repatriate or reverse the\ndeposits, resulting in a loss to us of the credited amount. The following table summarizes the brokerage related allowance for credit losses as a\nreduction of receivables from users, net on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nBeginning balance $ 20 $ 15 $ 18 $ 15\nProvision for credit losses 3 6 18 16\nWrite-offs (7) (6) (20) (16)\nEnding balance $ 16 $ 15 $ 16 $ 15\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Credit Card Related\nWe have two types of allowance for credit losses related to credit cards: i) an allowance related to off-balance sheet credit card receivables,\nshown as part of accounts payable and accrued expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, and ii) an allowance related\nto purchased credit card receivables and interest receivable from customers, shown as a reduction of receivables from users, net on the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Credit card related allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of\nexpected credit losses from credit exposure over the remaining expected life of credit card receivables. The credit card receivables allowance\ntakes into account information from internal and external sources, including historical collection data, charge off trends by FICO cohort, and\nmarket data. We write-off balances when the balance becomes outstanding for over\n16\nTable of Contents\n180 days or when we otherwise deem the balance to be uncollectible. Write-offs for off-balance sheet credit card receivables are classified as\ncredit loss payments to Coastal Bank.\nThe following table summarizes the allowance related to off-balance sheet credit card receivables:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nBeginning balance $ — $ 34 $ — $ 32\nOpening balance from acquisition of Robinhood Credit 16 — 16 —\nProvision for credit losses 10 11 10 30\nCredit loss payments to Coastal Bank (4) (8) (4) (26)\nRecoveries — 1 — 2\nEnding balance $ 22 $ 38 $ 22 $ 38\nThe following table summarizes the allowance related to purchased credit card receivables and interest receivables from customers:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nBeginning balance $ — $ 3 $ — $ 1\nProvision for credit losses 1 6 1 11\nWrite-offs — (1) — (4)\nEnding balance $ 1 $ 8 $ 1 $ 8\nNOTE 6: INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had $500 million and $750 million of available-for-sale time deposits classified as\ncash equivalents on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized\nby the pricing services in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any transfers in or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities.\nSafeguarded user cryptocurrencies\nSafeguarded user cryptocurrencies were as follows:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024\nBitcoin (BTC) $ 6,149 $ 9,416\nEthereum (ETH) 3,761 4,014\nDogecoin (DOGE) 3,319 4,001\nOther 1,479 2,025\nTotal user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and corresponding asset $ 14,708 $ 19,456\nThe fair value of the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and the corresponding asset were determined based on observed market\npricing representing the last price executed for trades of each cryptocurrency as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 7: DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nIn 2023, we entered into two interest rate floors that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with our margin\nreceivables. One interest rate floor with a notional amount of $2 billion was effective as of June 30, 2023. Another with a notional amount of\n$1 billion was effective as of January 1, 2024. Both interest rate floors had a maturity of six months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad no derivatives and hedging activities.\nAmounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) related to interest rate floors were reclassified to net interest\nrevenues as interest payments were received or paid on the hedged items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the amount of gain or loss recognized in AOCI on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nLoss on derivatives included in effectiveness\nassessment $ (1) $ — $ (4) $ —\nLoss reclassified from AOCI into net interest revenues\nincluded in effectiveness assessment — — — 3\nTotal $ (1) $ — $ (4) $ 3\nThe following table summarizes the components of AOCI including hedging activities on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nBeginning balance $ (3) $ — $ — $ (3)\nForeign currency translation:\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications — 1 — 1\nOther comprehensive income after reclassification, net\nof tax — 1 — 1\nHedging instruments:\nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications (1) — (4) —\nReclassification adjustment for net gains included in\nnet interest revenues, net of tax — — — 3\nOther comprehensive income (loss) after\nreclassification, net of tax (1) — (4) 3\nEnding balance $ (4) $ 1 $ (4) $ 1\n23\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 8: INCOME TAXES\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except percentages) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ (75) $ 153 $ (562) $ 506\nProvision for income taxes 10 3 9 11\nEffective tax rate (12.7)% 1.9 % (1.5)% 2.2 %\nOur tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate (“ETR”), adjusted for discrete items arising in\nthe period. In each quarter, we update our estimated annual ETR and make a year-to-date calculation of the provision.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the ETR was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to\nthe full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets offset by current taxes payable.\nThe realization of tax benefits of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future levels of taxable income, of an appropriate character, in\nthe periods the items are expected to be deductible or taxable. Based on the available objective evidence during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the remaining U.S. federal, state, and certain foreign net\ndeferred tax assets may not be realized until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nUtilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change\nlimitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the\nexpiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization.\nIn June 2024, California's Governor signed Senate Bill 167 (“SB 167”), which temporarily suspends the use of California net operating losses\nand imposes a cap on business incentive tax credits that we can utilize against our income taxes, and Senate Bill 175 (“SB 175”), allows for the\nrecovery of suspended credits. We believe the recent tax legislation changes provided under SB 167 and SB 175 do not materially impact our\nincome tax provision and do not change our evaluation of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in California as of September 30,\n2024.\nNOTE 9: SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING\nOur securities lending transactions are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements with other broker-dealers; however, we do not\nnet securities borrowing and lending transactions. Therefore, activity related to securities borrowing and lending activities are presented gross on\nour unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen we borrow fully-paid securities from users and third parties, we provide cash collateral to our users and third parties, which represents\nour rights to the collateral provided to our users and third parties and is recorded as “securities borrowed”, an asset, on our unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. When we lend securities to third parties, we receive cash as collateral, which represents our obligation\nto return the collateral and is recorded as “securities loaned”, a liability, on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following tables set forth certain balances related to our securities borrowing and lending activities as of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024:\n24\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024\nAssets Securities borrowed\nGross amount of cash collateral provided to users for securities borrowing transactions $ 1,602 $ 3,704\nGross amount offset on the consolidated balance sheets — —\nAmounts of assets presented on the consolidated balance sheets 1,602 3,704\nGross amount not offset on the consolidated balance sheets:\nCash collateral provided to users and third parties for securities borrowing transactions 1,602 3,704\nFair value of securities borrowed from users and third parties (1,536) (3,614)\nNet amount $ 66 $ 90\nLiabilities Securities loaned\nGross amount of cash collateral received from counterparties for securities lending transactions $ 3,547 $ 7,306\nGross amount offset on the consolidated balance sheets — —\nAmounts of liabilities presented on the consolidated balance sheets 3,547 7,306\nGross amount not offset on the consolidated balance sheets:\nCash collateral received from counterparties for securities lending transactions 3,547 7,306\nFair value of securities pledged to counterparties (3,188) (6,842)\nNet amount $ 359 $ 464\nWe obtain securities on terms that permit us to pledge and/or transfer securities to others. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024, we were permitted to re-pledge securities with a fair value of $4.78 billion and $7.48 billion under margin account agreements with users.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were permitted to re-pledge securities with a fair value of an immaterial balance that we borrowed under the\nmaster securities loan agreements (“MSLAs”) with third parties. As of September 30, 2024, there were no securities re-pledged from borrowing\nunder MSLAs with third parties. Under the Fully-Paid Securities Lending program, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we were\npermitted to borrow securities with a fair value of $14.03 billion and $29.43 billion including securities with a fair value of $1.54 billion and\n$3.61 billion that we had borrowed from users.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had re-pledged securities with a fair value of $3.19 billion and $6.84 billion, in each\ncase under MSLAs and fixed-term securities lending agreements with third parties. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024, we had re-pledged $676 million and $1.22 billion of the permitted amounts under the margin account agreements with clearing\norganizations to meet deposit requirements.\nNOTE 10: FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nRHM March 2024 Credit Agreement\nOn March 22, 2024, RHM entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “RHM March 2024\nCredit Agreement”) amending and restating the unsecured revolving line of credit entered into in October 2019 and as thereafter amended (refer\nto Note 13 - Financing Activities and Off-Balance Sheet Risk, of the 2023 Form 10-K for more information). The RHM March 2024 Credit\nAgreement has an initial commitment of $750 million with a maturity date of March 22,\n25\nTable of Contents\n2027. Under circumstances described in the RHM March 2024 Credit Agreement, the aggregate commitments may be increased by up to\n$187.5 million, for a total commitment of up to $937.5 million. Borrowings under the RHM March 2024 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a\nrate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR (“Secured Overnight Financing Rate”) plus an applicable margin rate of\n1.50%. For purposes of the RHM Credit Agreement, the Alternate Base Rate is the greatest of (i) the prime rate then in effect, (ii) the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York rate then in effect plus 0.5% and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.0%. The\nAdjusted Term SOFR Rate is equal to the Term SOFR, published by the Term SOFR Administrator, plus the Term SOFR Adjustment. The Term\nSOFR Adjustment is 0.10%. If the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate is less than the floor of 0%, such rate shall be deemed to be equal to the floor.\nRHM is obligated to pay a commitment fee calculated at a per annum rate equal to 0.25% on any unused amount of the RHM March 2024 Credit\nAgreement.\nRHS March 2024 Credit Agreement\nOn March 22, 2024, RHS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “RHS March\n2024 Credit Agreement”) among RHS, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent,\namending and restating the $2.175 billion 364-day senior secured revolving credit facility entered into in March 2023 (refer to Note 13 -\nFinancing Activities and Off-Balance Sheet Risk, of the 2023 Form 10-K for more information).\nThe RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement provides for a 364-day senior secured revolving credit facility with a total commitment of\n$2.25 billion. Under circumstances described in the RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement, the aggregate commitments may be increased by up to\n$1.125 billion, for a total commitment of $3.375 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility must be specified to be Tranche A, Tranche B,\nTranche C or a combination thereof. Tranche A loans are secured by users’ securities purchased on margin and are used primarily to finance\nmargin loans. Tranche B loans are secured by the right to the return from National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) of NSCC margin\ndeposits and cash and property in a designated collateral account and used for the purpose of satisfying NSCC deposit requirements. Tranche C\nloans are secured by the right to the return of eligible funds from any reserve account of the borrower and cash and property in a designated\ncollateral account and used for the purpose of satisfying reserve requirements under Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”).\nBorrowings under the RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) Daily Simple\nSOFR plus 0.10% (as defined in the RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement), (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the RHS March\n2024 Credit Agreement) and (iii) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement), in each case, as of\nthe day the loan is initiated, plus an applicable margin rate. The applicable margin rate is 1.25% for Tranche A loans and 2.50% for Tranche B\nand Tranche C loans. Undrawn commitments will accrue commitment fees at a rate per annum equal to 0.50%.\nThe RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement requires RHS to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum excess net\ncapital, and subjects RHS to a specified limit on minimum net capital to aggregate debit items. In addition, the RHS March 2024 Credit\nAgreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to debt, liens, fundamental changes,\nasset sales, restricted payments, investments and transactions with affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. Amounts due under the RHS March\n2024 Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon an “event of default,” as defined in the RHS March 2024 Credit Agreement, such as failure to\npay amounts owed thereunder when due, breach of a covenant, material inaccuracy of a representation, or occurrence of bankruptcy or\ninsolvency, subject in some cases to cure periods.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding and we were in compliance with all covenants, as\napplicable, under our revolving credit facilities.\n26\nTable of Contents\nCredit Card Funding Trust\nUnder terms of the Coastal Community Bank (“Coastal Bank”) Program Agreement (discussed below), Robinhood Credit has the ability to\npurchase credit card receivables originated and held for a period of time by Coastal Bank. Robinhood Credit continues to earn interest from\ncustomers and uses these purchased credit card receivables as collateral under a trust structure to access debt financing in the ordinary course\nof business. To help facilitate these transactions, we created a VIE known as the Credit Card Funding Trust (the “Trust”).\nWe are the primary beneficiary of the Trust as, through our role as the servicer and administrator, we have the power to direct the activities\nthat most significantly affect the Trust's economic performance and, due to owning all the equity interest in the Trust, have the right to receive\nbenefits or the obligation to absorb losses. As such, we consolidate the Trust in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Substantially\nall of the Trust’s assets and liabilities are the purchased credit card receivables, included in receivables from users, net, and the outstanding\nborrowing, included in other current liabilities, on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nOur exposure to losses in the Trust is limited to the carrying value of net assets held by the Trust, including expected credit losses related to\nthe purchased credit card receivables (Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses). For the Trust, the creditors have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit and the liabilities of the Trust can only be settled by the Trust’s assets. Additionally, the assets of the Trust can only be used to\nsettle obligations of the Trust.\nThe credit card receivables of the Trust have risks and characteristics similar to other off-balance sheet credit card receivables owned by\nCoastal Bank and were underwritten to the same standard. Accordingly, the performance of these assets is expected to be similar to other\ncomparable credit card receivables.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Trust had one arrangement in place to borrow up to $100 million which will mature in April 2025. Borrowings\nunder this arrangement bear interest at an annual rate of SOFR plus 2.75% for outstanding borrowings less than $50 million, and SOFR plus\n2.50% for outstanding borrowings greater than $50 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased $239 million of\ncredit card receivables. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of purchased credit card receivables that had not been collected, net of\nprovision for credit losses, was $99 million, and the outstanding balance of borrowing principal and interest was $94 million. There were no\npurchases of credit card receivables or borrowings under this arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the related interest revenue and expense of the Trust were immaterial.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nCoastal Bank Program Agreement\nUnder a program agreement between us and Coastal Bank (the “Program Agreement”) most recently amended in November 2023, Coastal\nBank may fund up to $300 million of credit card receivables. Robinhood Credit pays Coastal Bank interest based on the average balance of\nadvances during the month at the federal funds rate plus a margin of 3.75% on the first $150 million and 3.00% on such amounts in excess of\n$150 million.\nThe credit card receivables and the funding from Coastal Bank are off-balance sheet, considering Coastal Bank is the legal lender and\noriginator, the party to which the customer has a creditor-borrower relationship, and the legal owner of the receivables. As of September 30,\n2024, the off-balance sheet credit card receivables funded under the Program Agreement was $202 million.\n27\nTable of Contents\nTransaction Settlement\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in activities involving settlement and financing of securities transactions. User securities\ntransactions are recorded on a settlement date basis. Effective May 2024, settlement date for equities has been shortened from two business\ndays after the trade date to one business day after the trade date, while the settlement date for options remains unchanged at one business day\nafter the trade date. These activities may expose us to off-balance sheet risk in the event that the other party to the transaction is unable to fulfill\nits contractual obligations. In such events, we may be required to purchase financial instruments at prevailing market prices in order to fulfill our\nobligations.\nNOTE 11: COMMON STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, no terms of the preferred stock were designated and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nWe have three authorized classes of common stock: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to\none vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by our stockholders, holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share\non all matters to be voted upon by our stockholders and, except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of our Class C common stock\nare not entitled to vote on any matter to be voted upon by our stockholders. The holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our “Charter”) or\napplicable law.\nWarrants\nAs of September 30, 2024, warrants outstanding consisted of warrants to purchase 14.3 million shares of Class A common stock with a\nstrike price of $26.60 per share. The warrants expire on February 12, 2031 and can be exercised with cash or net shares settled at the holder’s\noption. In aggregate, the maximum purchase amount of all warrants is $380 million. As of September 30, 2024, the warrants had not been\nexercised.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn May 28, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing\nthe Company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding Class A common stock. While the Repurchase Program does not have an\nexpiration date, we continue to expect to complete over a period of two to three years. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany repurchased 5 million shares of our Class A common stock for $97 million.\nThe timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by us from time to time at our discretion based on our evaluation of\nmarket conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchase transactions may be made using a variety of methods, such as open market share\nrepurchases, including the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, or other financial arrangements\nor transactions. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any particular\n28\nTable of Contents\namount of Class A common stock and the Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. All shares\nrepurchased will be subsequently retired.\nEquity Incentive Plans\n2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nOur 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) became effective on July 27, 2021, and provides for the grant of share-based awards (such\nas options, including incentive stock options, non statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”), performance units, and other equity-based awards) and cash-based awards.\nAs of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of 448 million shares had been authorized for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013\nStock Plan, as amended, 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and 2021 Plan, of which 146 million shares had been issued under the plans,\n45 million shares were reserved for issuance upon the exercise or settlement of outstanding equity awards under the plans, and 257 million\nshares remained available for new grants under the 2021 Plan.\nTime-Based RSUs\nWe grant RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a time-based service condition (“Time-Based RSUs”).

We record an accrual for loss contingencies at management’s best estimate when we determine that it is probable\nthat a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate is a range and no amount\nwithin that range is considered a better estimate than any other amount, an accrual is recorded based on the bottom amount of the range. If a\nloss is not probable, or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded. Amounts accrued for contingencies in the\naggregate were $190 million as of December 31, 2023 and $175 million as of September 30, 2024. In our opinion, an adequate accrual had\nbeen made as of each such date to provide for the probable losses of which we are aware and for which we can reasonably estimate an amount.\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nThe securities industry, and many other industries in which we operate, are highly regulated and many aspects of our business involve\nsubstantial risk of liability. In past years, there has been an increase in litigation and regulatory investigations involving the brokerage,\ncryptocurrency, and credit card industries. Litigation has included and may in the future include class action suits that generally seek substantial\nand, in some cases, punitive damages. Federal and state regulators, exchanges, other SROs, or international regulators investigate issues\nrelated to regulatory compliance that may result in\n32\nTable of Contents\nenforcement action. We are also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections that have in the past and could in the future lead to\nenforcement investigations or actions.\nWe have been named as a defendant in lawsuits and from time to time we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in\narbitrations and administrative proceedings. The outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain and some may result in adverse judgments\nor awards, including penalties, injunctions, or other relief, and we may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of\nlitigation.\nWith respect to matters discussed below, we believe, based on current knowledge, that any losses (in excess of amounts accrued, if\napplicable) as of September 30, 2024 that are reasonably possible and can be reasonably estimated will not, in the aggregate, have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results, or cash flows. However, for many of the matters disclosed below, particularly\nthose in early stages, we cannot reasonably estimate the reasonably possible loss (or range of loss), if any. In addition, the ultimate outcome of\nlegal proceedings involves judgments and inherent uncertainties and cannot be predicted with certainty. Any judgment entered against us, or any\nadverse settlement, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We might also\nincur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against legal and regulatory claims.\nDescribed below are certain pending matters in which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred. We\nintend to continue to defend these matters vigorously.\nBest Execution, Payment for Order Flow, and Sources of Revenue Civil Litigation\nBeginning in December 2020, multiple putative securities fraud class action lawsuits were filed against RHM, RHF, and RHS. Five cases\nwere consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in May\n2021, alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and various state law causes of action based on claims that we violated the duty\nof best execution and misled putative class members by publishing misleading statements and omissions in customer communications relating\nto the execution of trades and revenue sources (including PFOF). Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, restitution, disgorgement, and\nother relief. In February 2022, the court granted Robinhood’s motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint without prejudice. In March\n2022, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint, alleging only violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, which Robinhood\nmoved to dismiss. In October 2022, the court granted Robinhood’s motion in part and denied it in part. In November 2022, Robinhood filed a\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court denied in January 2023. In March 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,\nwhich Robinhood is opposing.\nState Regulatory Matters\nCertain state regulatory authorities have conducted investigations regarding RHF’s options trading and related customer communications\nand displays, options and margin trading approval process, the service outages on our U.S. stock trading platform on March 2-3, 2020 and\nMarch 9, 2020 (the “March 2020 Outages”), and customer support prior to June 2020. RHF has reached and paid settlements with 46 states for\nan aggregate of $9.2 million and may reach settlements with the remaining states as part of a multi-state settlement related to these issues for\napproximately $1 million. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) previously conducted an investigation and reached a settlement\nwith RHF regarding many of these issues.\nThe New York Attorney General is conducting an investigation into brokerage execution quality, and the Massachusetts Securities Division\n(“MSD”) is examining RHF’s customer complaint supervision. We are cooperating with these investigations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nBrokerage Enforcement Matters\nFINRA Enforcement staff are conducting investigations related to, among other things, RHS’s reporting of fractional share trades, as\napplicable, to a Trade Reporting Facility, the Over-the-Counter Reporting Facility, the Order Audit Trail System, and the Consolidated Audit Trail;\nRHS’s reporting of accounts holding significant options positions to the Large Option Position Report system; processing of certain requests for\ntransfers of assets from Robinhood through the Automated Customer Account Transfer System (“ACATS”); responses to Electronic Blue Sheets\nrequests from FINRA; the delays in notification from third parties and process failures within our brokerage systems and operations in connection\nwith the handling of a 1-for-25 reverse stock split transaction of Cosmo Health, Inc, in December 2022 (the “Q4 2022 Processing Error”); RHF’s\nand RHS’s compliance with FINRA registration requirements for member personnel; marketing involving social media influencers and affiliates;\ncollaring the prices of certain trade orders; RHS’s and RHF’s compliance with best execution obligations; RHS’s compliance with FINRA Rules\n6190, 5260, and 6121; RHS’s and RHF’s compliance with regulations governing the delivery of required documents; matters related to RHS’s\nand RHF’s supervision of technology; origin code reporting; customer complaint supervision and restriction issues; and compliance with FINRA\nRule 3210. We are cooperating with these investigations.\nRHS has received requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement regarding its compliance with Regulation SHO’s trade reporting and other\nrequirements in connection with securities lending, fractional share trading, the Q4 2022 Processing Error, and responses to Electronic Blue\nSheets requests, and previously received similar requests from FINRA examinations staff including with respect to short interest reporting. RHS\nand RHF have also received requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement and FINRA Enforcement staff related to RHS’s and RHF’s\ncompliance with recordkeeping requirements, including requests regarding off-channel communications. We are cooperating with these\ninvestigations.\nRobinhood Crypto Matters\nRHC received subpoenas from the California Attorney General’s Office (the “CAGO”) seeking information about, among other things, RHC’s\ntrading platform, business and operations, custody of customer assets, customer disclosures, and coin listings. On August 31, 2024, RHC\nreached a settlement with the CAGO to resolve this matter for which we paid $3.9 million. The settlement related to certain disclosures by RHC\nand delivery of customers’ cryptocurrency assets under California Corporations Code Sections 29520 and 29505 during the period January 2018\nthrough April 2022.\nRHC also has received investigative subpoenas from the SEC regarding, among other topics, RHC’s cryptocurrency listings, custody of\ncryptocurrencies, and platform operations. RHC is cooperating with this investigation. On May 4, 2024, RHC received a “Wells Notice” (the “May\n2024 Wells Notice”) from the Staff of the SEC (the “SEC Staff”) stating that the SEC Staff has advised RHC that it made a “preliminary\ndetermination” to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against RHC alleging violations of Sections 15(a) and 17A of the\nExchange Act. The potential action may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding\nand may seek remedies that include an injunction, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and\ncensure, revocation, and limitations on activities.\nAccount Takeovers, Anti-Money Laundering, and Cybersecurity Matters\nFINRA Enforcement and the SEC Division of Enforcement are investigating account takeovers (i.e., circumstances under which an\nunauthorized actor successfully logs into a customer account), as well as anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity issues. The SEC\nDivision of Enforcement is also investigating the data security incident we experienced in November 2021 when an unauthorized third-party\nsocially engineered a customer support employee by phone and obtained access to certain customer support systems (the “November 2021\nData Security Incident”). In March 2024, FINRA closed its investigation of the November 2021 Data Security Incident. The SEC’s Division of\nEnforcement and the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) are also investigating issues related to compliance with the Electronic\nFunds Transfer Act. We are cooperating with these investigations.\n34\nTable of Contents\nText Message Litigation\nIn August 2021, Cooper Moore filed a putative class action against RHF alleging that RHF initiated or assisted in the transmission of\ncommercial electronic text messages to Washington State residents without their consent in violation of Washington state law. The complaint\nseeks unspecified total statutory and treble monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The case is currently pending in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. RHF filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In February 2022, Moore and Andrew\nGillette filed an amended complaint, which RHF again moved to dismiss. In August 2022, the court denied RHF’s motion to dismiss. The parties\nreached a settlement in principle to resolve this matter and in July 2024, the court granted final approval of the $9 million settlement.\nMassachusetts Securities Division Matter\nIn December 2020, the MSD filed an administrative complaint against RHF, which stems from an investigation initiated by the MSD in July\n2020. The complaint alleged three counts of Massachusetts securities law violations regarding alleged unethical and dishonest conduct or\npractices, failure to supervise, and failure to act in accordance with the Massachusetts fiduciary duty standard, which became effective on March\n6, 2020 and had an effective enforcement date beginning September 1, 2020. Among other things, the MSD alleged that our product features\nand marketing strategies, outages, and options trading approval process constitute violations of Massachusetts securities laws. MSD\nsubsequently filed an amended complaint that seeks, among other things, injunctive relief (a permanent cease and desist order), censure,\nrestitution, disgorgement, appointment of an independent consultant, an administrative fine, and revocation of RHF’s license to operate in\nMassachusetts. If RHF were to lose its license to operate in Massachusetts, we would not be able to acquire any new customers in\nMassachusetts, and we expect that our current customers in Massachusetts would be unable to continue utilizing any of the services or products\noffered on our platform (other than closing their positions) and that we may be forced to transfer such customers’ accounts to other broker-\ndealers. Additionally, revocation of RHF’s Massachusetts license could trigger similar disqualification or proceedings to restrict or condition\nRHF’s registration by other state regulators. A revocation of RHF’s license to operate in Massachusetts would result in RHF and RHS being\nsubject to statutory disqualification by FINRA and the SEC, which would then result in RHF needing to obtain relief from FINRA subject to SEC\nreview in order to remain a FINRA member and RHS possibly needing relief from FINRA or other SROs.\nIn April 2021, RHF filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction and declaratory relief in Massachusetts state court seeking to\nenjoin the MSD administrative proceeding and challenging the legality of the Massachusetts fiduciary duty standard. In September 2021, the\nparties filed cross-motions for partial judgment on the pleadings. In March 2022, the court ruled in favor of RHF, declaring that the\nMassachusetts fiduciary duty regulation was unlawful. In August 2023, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reversed the decision of the\nMassachusetts Superior Court. In January 2024, we settled this matter with the MSD related to supervision of certain product features and\nmarketing strategies, the March 2020 Outages, and our options trading approval process, as well as the November 2021 Data Security Incident,\nunder which we paid a $7.5 million fine and engaged an independent consultant to review, among other things, implementation of the FINRA\nindependent’s recommendations, policies and procedures regarding certain application features, and cybersecurity measures. The independent\nconsultant’s review is complete and RHF has implemented all of its recommendations. RHF has dismissed its state court action.\nEarly 2021 Trading Restrictions Matters\nBeginning on January 28, 2021, due to increased deposit requirements imposed on RHS by the NSCC in response to unprecedented\nmarket volatility, particularly in certain securities, RHS temporarily restricted or limited its customers’ purchase of certain securities, including\nGameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., on our U.S. trading platform (the “Early 2021 Trading Restrictions”).\n35\nTable of Contents\nA number of individual and putative class actions related to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions were filed against RHM, RHF, and RHS,\namong others, in various federal and state courts. In April 2021, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation entered an order centralizing the\nfederal cases identified in a motion to transfer and coordinate or consolidate the actions filed in connection with the Early 2021 Trading\nRestrictions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The court subsequently divided plaintiffs’ claims against\nRobinhood into three tranches: federal antitrust claims, federal securities law claims, and state law claims. In July 2021, plaintiffs filed\nconsolidated complaints seeking unspecified monetary damages in connection with the federal antitrust and state law tranches. The federal\nantitrust complaint asserted one violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; the state law complaint asserted negligence and breach of fiduciary\nduty claims. In August 2021, we moved to dismiss both of these complaints.\nIn September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting state law claims of negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious\ninterference with contract and business relationship, civil conspiracy, and breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and implied\nduty of care. In January 2022, the court dismissed the state law complaint with prejudice. In August 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s order.\nIn November 2021, the court dismissed the federal antitrust complaint without prejudice. In January 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint in connection with the federal antitrust tranche and Robinhood moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In May 2022, the court\ndismissed the federal antitrust complaint with prejudice. In June 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court’s order.\nIn November 2021, plaintiffs for the federal securities tranche filed a complaint alleging violations of Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange\nAct. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, costs and expenses, and other relief. In January 2022, we moved to dismiss the\nfederal securities law complaint. In August 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part Robinhood’s motion to dismiss. In November 2023,\nthe court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification without prejudice. In April 2024, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a\nrenewed motion for class certification. On May 28, 2024, Robinhood notified the court that it had reached a settlement in principle with the\nPlaintiffs in their individual capacities. Robinhood subsequently notified the court that one of these Plaintiffs was unwilling to sign the settlement\nagreement and requested additional time to negotiate with that individual. On August 14, 2024, the court dismissed the lead and named\nPlaintiffs’ claims. In October 2024, Robinhood notified the court that it was conferring with counsel for the remaining individual securities actions\nin connection with moving to compel arbitration for the majority of the remaining securities claims and ongoing substantive settlement\nnegotiations.\nRHM, RHF, RHS, and our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Vladimir Tenev, among others, have received requests for\ninformation, and in some cases, subpoenas and requests for testimony, related to investigations and examinations of the Early 2021 Trading\nRestrictions from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“USAO”), the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ”),\nAntitrust Division, the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, FINRA, the New York Attorney General’s Office, other state attorneys general offices, and\na number of state securities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev's cell phone. There have\nbeen several inquiries based on specific customer complaints. We have also received requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement and\nFINRA related to employee trading in certain securities that were subject to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions, including GameStop Corp. and\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., during the week of January 25, 2021. These matters include requests related to whether any employee\ntrading in these securities may have occurred after the decision to impose the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions and before the public\nannouncement of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions on January 28, 2021. We are cooperating with these investigations. FINRA Enforcement\nhas also requested information about policies, procedures, and supervision related to employee trading generally.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIPO Litigation\nIn December 2021, Philip Golubowski filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against\nRHM, the officers and directors who signed Robinhood’s initial public offering (“IPO”) offering documents, and Robinhood’s IPO underwriters.\nPlaintiff’s claims are based on alleged false or misleading statements in Robinhood’s IPO offering documents allegedly in violation of Sections 11\nand 12(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages, rescission of\nshareholders’ share purchases, and an award for attorneys’ fees and costs. In February 2022, certain alleged Robinhood stockholders submitted\napplications seeking appointment by the court to be the lead plaintiff to represent the putative class in this matter, and in March 2022, the court\nappointed lead plaintiffs. In June 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, Robinhood filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\nIn February 2023, the court granted Robinhood’s motion without prejudice. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. In\nJanuary 2024, the court granted Robinhood’s motion to dismiss the second amended complaint without leave to amend. In February 2024,\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the 9th Circuit and the appeal is currently pending.\nIn January 2022, Robert Zito filed a complaint derivatively on behalf of Robinhood against Robinhood’s directors at the time of its IPO in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Plaintiff alleges breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations of false or misleading statements in Robinhood’s IPO\noffering documents, and plaintiff seeks an award of unspecified damages and restitution to the Company, injunctive relief, and an award for\nattorney’s fees and costs. In March 2022, the district court entered a stay of this litigation pending resolution of Robinhood’s motion to dismiss in\nthe Golubowski securities action discussed above.\nIn August 2022, a shareholder sent a letter to the RHM board of directors demanding, among other things, that the board of directors pursue\ncauses of action on behalf of the Company related to allegations of misconduct in connection with the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions,\nRobinhood’s IPO offering documents, and the November 2021 Data Security Incident. The board of directors has formed a Demand Review\nCommittee that is reviewing the demand.\nPay transparency litigation\nIn July 2024, RHM, RHY, and RHC were sued in a putative class action captioned John Milito v. Robinhood Markets, Inc. et. al., alleging that\nRobinhood violated Washington’s Equal Pay and Opportunity Act, because some of the Company’s job postings allegedly failed to include a\nwage scale or salary range. The complaint seeks unspecified total statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, injunctive relief, and declaratory\nrelief. The case is currently stayed in the Superior Court in King County in Washington pending a certified question to the Washington Supreme\nCourt.\nCash sweep litigation\nIn October 2024, RHM, RHF, and RHS were sued in a putative class action captioned Dey v. Robinhood Markets, Inc. et. al., in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiff asserts breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation and\nomissions, breach of implied covenant of good faith and dealing, and violation of California’s unfair competition law based on allegations that\ndefendants failed to pay a reasonable rate of interest to non-Robinhood Gold brokerage account holders on cash balances swept to program\nbank deposit programs.

The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and\ninformation presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and\nthe discussion under the heading “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our\n2023 Form 10-K. It is also intended to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements,\nthe changes in key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.\nTo the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which might not be indicative of\nour future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such\ndifferences are discussed in the sections titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”\nData as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 has been derived from our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements appearing at the beginning of this Quarterly Report. Results for any interim period should not be construed as\nan inference of what our results would be for any full fiscal year or future period.\nWe refer to our “users” and our “customers” interchangeably throughout this Quarterly Report to refer to individuals who hold accounts on\nour platforms.\nKey Performance Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance\nmetrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\n• Funded Customers: We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and,\nwithin the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a\nFunded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such\naccount. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded\nCustomer.\n• Assets Under Custody (“AUC”): We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by\nusers in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net\nmarket gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.\n• Net Deposits: We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash\nand assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock\nbonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets\ntransferred out of our platforms (assets transferred in or out\n38\nTable of Contents\ninclude debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet transfers) for a\nstated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with\nCompany promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from\nRobinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those\nfigures was immaterial.\n• Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”): We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded\nCustomers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this Quarterly Report represent\nARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.\n• Gold Subscribers: We define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as\nof the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee\npayment.\nGlossary Terms\n• Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (“ACATS”): A system that automates and standardizes procedures for the transfer of\nassets in a customer account from one brokerage firm and/or bank to another.\n• Cash Sweep: We define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total\namount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts\ninto deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest\nspread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our\nprogram terms.\n• Churned Customers: A Funded Customer is considered “Churned” if it was ever a New Funded Customer whose account balance\n(measured as the fair value of assets in the account less any amount due from the user and excluding amounts that are deposited into a\nFunded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) drops to or below zero and has not completed a\ntransaction using any account with a Robinhood entity for at least 45 consecutive calendar days. Negative balances typically result from\nfraudulent deposit transactions (which occur when users initiate deposits into their accounts, make trades on our platforms using a short-\nterm extension of credit from us, and then repatriate or reverse the deposits, resulting in a loss to us of the credited amount) and\nunauthorized debit card use, and less often, from margin loans.\n• Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits: When used with respect to Net Deposits, “growth rate” and\n“annualized growth rate” provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. “Growth rate” is calculated as aggregate Net\nDeposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period.\n“Annualized growth rate” is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately\npreceding quarter.\n• Investment Accounts: We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, or\na funded individual retirement account (“IRA”). As of September 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to four Investment Accounts\n- individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July 2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\n• Margin Book: We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end\ntotal amount we are owed by customers on loans made\n39\nTable of Contents\nfor the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\n• New Funded Customers: We define a New Funded Customer as a unique person who became a Funded Customer for the first time\nduring the relevant period.\n• Notional Trading Volume: We define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase\nprice or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.\n• Options Contracts Traded: We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a\nspecified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\n• Resurrected Customers: A Funded Customer is considered “Resurrected” in a stated period if it was a Churned Customer as of the\nend of the immediately preceding period and its balance (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the\nCompany with no action taken by the unique person) rises above zero or it completes a transaction using its account.\nOverview\nRobinhood was founded on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in our financial system. We are creating modern\nfinancial services platforms for everyone, regardless of their wealth, income, or background.\nOur mission is to democratize finance for all. We use technology to provide access to the financial system in a way that is simple and\nconvenient for our customers. We believe investing should be familiar and welcoming, with a simple design and an intuitive interface, so that\ncustomers are empowered to achieve their goals. We started with a revolutionary, bold brand and design in the Robinhood app which makes\ninvesting approachable for millions. We pioneered commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which has since been adopted by\nthe rest of the industry, and we continue to build relationships with our customers by introducing new products that further expand access to the\nfinancial system. Through these efforts, we believe we have made investing culturally relevant and understandable, and that our platforms are\nenabling our customers to become long-term investors and take greater control of their finances.\nFinancial Results and Performance\nWith respect to the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:\n• total net revenues increased 36% to $637 million compared to $467 million;\n• net income was $150 million, or diluted EPS of $0.17, compared to a net loss of $85 million, or diluted EPS of -$0.09;\n• total operating expenses decreased 10% to $486 million compared to $540 million;\n40\nTable of Contents\n◦ SBC expense decreased 5% to $79 million compared to $83 million;\n• Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 96% to $268 million compared to $137 million;\n• Funded Customers increased 4% to 24.3 million compared to 23.3 million, and Investment Accounts increased by 1.5 million to\n25.1 million;\n• AUC increased 76% to $152.2 billion compared to $86.5 billion, driven by continued Net Deposits and higher equity and cryptocurrency\nvaluations;\n• Net Deposits were $10.0 billion, an annualized growth rate of 29% relative to AUC at the end of the second quarter of 2024, compared to\n$4.0 billion, an annualized growth rate of 18% relative to AUC at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Over the past twelve months,\nNet Deposits were $39.0 billion, a growth rate of 45% relative to AUC at the end of the third quarter of 2023;\n• ARPU increased 31% to $105 compared to $80; and\n• Gold Subscribers increased 65% to 2.19 million compared to 1.33 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information about Adjusted EBITDA, including the definition and limitations of\nsuch measure, and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, please see “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nKey Performance Metrics\nKey performance metrics for the relevant periods were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2024 % Change\nFunded Customers(1) (in millions) 23.3 24.3 4 %\nAUC(2) (in billions) $ 86.5 $ 152.2 76 %\nNet Deposits (in billions) $ 4.0 $ 10.0 NM\nARPU (in dollars) $ 80 $ 105 31 %\nGold Subscribers (in millions) 1.33 2.19 65 %\n________________\n(1) The following table describes the annual changes within Funded Customers:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change\nBeginning Funded Customers 23.2 24.2 4 %\nNew Funded Customers 0.3 0.4 33 %\nResurrected Customers 0.1 0.1 — %\nChurned Customers (0.3) (0.4) 33 %\nEnding Funded Customers 23.3 24.3 4 %\n41\nTable of Contents\n(2) The following table sets out the components of AUC by type of asset:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in billions) 2023 2024 % Change\nEquities $ 61.4 $ 106.4 73 %\nCryptocurrencies 10.2 19.5 91 %\nOptions 0.4 1.2 200 %\nCash held by Customers 18.0 30.6 70 %\nReceivables from Customers (primarily margin balances) (3.5) (5.5) 57 %\nAUC $ 86.5 $ 152.2 76 %\nThe following table describes the changes within AUC:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in billions) 2023 2024 % Change\nBeginning AUC $ 88.8 $ 139.7 57 %\nNet Deposits 4.0 10.0 NM\nNet market gains (losses) (6.3) 2.5 NM\nEnding AUC $ 86.5 $ 152.2 76 %\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our\nperformance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss), and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding\n(i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v)\nsignificant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring\ncharges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results. This non-GAAP\nfinancial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and\ntiming of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors\nless meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of\noperations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is\na key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate\nperformance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted\nEBITDA:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNet income (loss) $ (85) $ 150 $ (571) $ 495\nAdd:\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities 6 6 17 18\nProvision for income taxes 10 3 9 11\nDepreciation and amortization 19 20 54 55\nEBITDA (non-GAAP) (50) 179 (491) 579\nAdd: SBC\n2021 Founders Award Cancellation — — 485 —\nSBC Excluding 2021 Founders Award Cancellation 83 79 305 227\nSignificant legal and tax settlements and reserves 104 10 104 10\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 137 $ 268 $ 403 $ 816\n43\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nRevenues:\nTransaction-based revenues $ 185 $ 319 $ 585 $ 975\nNet interest revenues 251 274 693 813\nOther revenues 31 44 116 149\nTotal net revenues 467 637 1,394 1,937\nOperating expenses:(1)\nBrokerage and transaction 39 39 114 114\nTechnology and development 202 205 608 610\nOperations 41 50 119 140\nMarketing 28 59 79 190\nGeneral and administrative 230 133 1,036 385\nTotal operating expenses 540 486 1,956 1,439\nOther income (expense), net (2) 2 — 8\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (75) 153 (562) 506\nProvision for income taxes 10 3 9 11\nNet income (loss) $ (85) $ 150 $ (571) $ 495\n_______________\n(1) Includes SBC expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nBrokerage and transaction $ 2 $ 2 $ 6 $ 7\nTechnology and development 51 48 161 144\nOperations 3 1 6 5\nMarketing 1 3 3 6\nGeneral and administrative 26 25 614 65\nTotal SBC expense $ 83 $ 79 $ 790 $ 227\n44\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2024\nRevenues\nTransaction-Based Revenues\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except for percentages) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nTransaction-based revenues:\nOptions $ 124 $ 202 63 % $ 384 $ 538 40 %\nCryptocurrencies 23 61 165 % 92 268 191 %\nEquities 27 37 37 % 79 116 47 %\nOther 11 19 73 % 30 53 77 %\nTotal transaction-based revenues $ 185 $ 319 72 % $ 585 $ 975 67 %\nTransaction-based revenues as a % of\ntotal net revenues:\nOptions 27% 32% 28% 28%\nCryptocurrencies 5% 9% 7% 14%\nEquities 5% 6% 6% 6%\nOther 3% 3% 2% 2%\nTotal transaction-based revenues 40% 50% 43% 50%\nTransaction-based revenues increased by $134 million and $390 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily\ndriven by increases of $38 million and $176 million in cryptocurrencies, $78 million and $154 million in options, and $10 million and $37 million in\nequities.\nCryptocurrencies revenues increased as a result of a 57% and 77% increase in the average Notional Trading Volume traded per trader and\na 31% and 32% increase in the number of users placing cryptocurrency trades. In addition, cryptocurrencies revenues benefited from a higher\nrebate rate from crypto market makers (an increase was effective in May 2024).\nOptions revenues increased due to a 23% and 20% increase in the number of users placing option trades and a 47% and 37% increase in\nOptions Contracts Traded. In addition, we experienced higher option rebate rates due to the mix of ticker symbols traded as different ticker\nsymbols pay different rebate rates. Option revenues decreased by $17 million and $25 million due to match incentives paid to our customers\n(Refer to Note 3 - Revenues to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for more information).\nEquities revenues increased primarily driven by a 41% and 32% increase in the average Notional Trading Volume traded per trader and a\n14% and 15% increase in the number of users placing equity trades. The increase was partially offset by lower equity rebate rates due to the mix\nof ticker symbols traded as different ticker symbols pay different rebate rates.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Revenues\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except for percentages) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nNet interest revenues:\nMargin interest $ 67 $ 83 24 % $ 177 $ 228 29 %\nInterest on corporate cash and\ninvestments 75 67 (11)% 217 203 (6)%\nInterest on segregated cash, securities,\nand deposits 59 61 3 % 156 187 20 %\nCash Sweep 35 46 31 % 86 129 50 %\nSecurities lending, net 17 19 12 % 70 68 (3)%\nCredit card, net 4 4 — % 4 16 300 %\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities (6) (6) — % (17) (18) 6 %\nTotal net interest revenues $ 251 $ 274 9 % $ 693 $ 813 17 %\nNet interest revenues as a % of total net\nrevenues:\nMargin interest 14 % 13 % 13 % 12 %\nInterest on corporate cash and\ninvestments 16 % 10 % 15 % 9 %\nInterest on segregated cash, securities,\nand deposits 13 % 10 % 11 % 10 %\nCash Sweep 7 % 7 % 7 % 7 %\nSecurities lending, net 4 % 3 % 5 % 4 %\nCredit card, net 1 % 1 % — % 1 %\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities (1)% (1)% (1)% (1)%\nTotal net interest revenues 54 % 43 % 50 % 42 %\nNet interest revenues increased by $23 million and $120 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases\nwere driven by growth in our total interest-earning assets balance. These increases were offset by decreases in interest revenues earned from\ncorporate cash and investments driven by lower cash and cash equivalents balances and lower short-term interest rate environment. In\nSeptember 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, which will negatively impact our net interest revenues and\nadversely impact our customers’ returns on their cash deposits.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes interest-earning assets, the revenue generated by these assets, and their respective annualized yields:\nInterest expenses\n(in millions, except for Margin Book C da es ph o a sin tsd (1) (offC -ba as lah n S cw e e se hp eetC )redit card, net (2) T eo at ra nl ii nn gte are ss st e- ts Securities n ele tnding, related to creditTotal rn ee vt e i nn ute er sest\nannualized yield) facilities (5)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2024$ 5,499 $ 11,149 $ 24,485 $309 $ 41,442\nJune 30, 2024 4,956 10,164 20,858 212 36,190\nAverage(3) 5,350 10,055 22,473 270 38,148\nRevenue (expense) 83 128 46 4 261 $ 19 $ (6)$ 274\nAnnualized yield(4) 6.21% 5.09% 0.82% 5.93% 2.74% 2.87%\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nJune 30, 2024$ 4,956 $ 10,164 $ 20,858 $212 $ 36,190\nMarch 31, 2024 4,115 10,328 19,049 197 33,689\nAverage(3) 4,431 10,249 19,823 201 34,704\nRevenue (expense) 73 134 44 6 257 $ 34 $ (6)$ 285\nAnnualized yield(4) 6.59% 5.23% 0.89% 11.94% 2.96% 3.28%\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2023$ 3,580 $ 9,102 $ 13,563 $197 $ 26,442\nJune 30, 2023 3,314 10,758 11,903 184 26,159\nAverage(3) 3,458 10,057 12,870 191 26,576\nRevenue (expense) 67 134 35 4 240 $ 17 $ (6)$ 251\nAnnualized yield(4) 7.75% 5.33% 1.09% 8.38% 3.61% 3.78%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2024$ 5,499 $ 11,149 $ 24,485 $309 $ 41,442\nDecember 31, 2023 3,458 10,107 16,352 205 30,122\nAverage(3) 4,511 10,075 19,958 228 34,772\nRevenue (expense) 228 390 129 16 763 $ 68 $ (18)$ 813\nAnnual yield(4) 6.74% 5.16% 0.86% 9.36% 2.93% 3.12%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2023$ 3,580 $ 9,102 $ 13,563 $197 $ 26,442\nDecember 31, 2022 3,089 9,530 5,837 N/A 18,456\nAverage(3) 3,255 10,119 10,215 N/A 23,589\nRevenue (expense) 177 373 86 4 640 $ 70 $ (17)$ 693\nAnnual yield(4) 7.25% 4.91% 1.12% N/A 3.62% 3.92%\n__________\n(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents, cash, cash equivalents, and securities segregated under federal and other regulations, deposits with clearing organizations, and\ninvestments.\n(2) Credit card, net consists of i) an off-balance sheet amount representing customer principal amounts funded by Coastal Bank under the Program Agreement.

Other brokerage and\ntransaction costs increased by $5 million and $15 million due to higher expenses related to our instant withdrawals feature driven by higher\nactivities. Additionally, employee compensation, benefits, and overhead increased by $1 million and $4 million driven by increased average\nheadcount to continue support brokerage business. These increases were offset by decreases of $8 million and $22 million in broker-dealer\ntransaction expenses as we began to pass option trading fees onto users starting in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTechnology and Development\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nEmployee compensation, benefits, and\noverhead, excluding SBC $ 74 $ 67 (9)% $ 237 $ 216 (9)%\nSBC 51 48 (6)% 161 144 (11)%\nCloud infrastructure services 40 49 23 % 107 138 29 %\nSoftware and tools 30 32 7 % 86 90 5 %\nOther 7 9 29 % 17 22 29 %\nTotal $ 202 $ 205 1 % $ 608 $ 610 — %\nTechnology and development costs increased by $3 million and $2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nprimarily due to increases in cloud infrastructure expenses of $9 million and $31 million to meet increased capacity requirements for our\nplatforms to support higher trading volumes. These increases were partially offset by decreases in employee compensation, benefits, and\noverhead of $7 million and $21 million and SBC of $3 million and $17 million, driven by reduced average headcount as part of our efforts to\nimprove efficiency and operating costs.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOperations\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nEmployee compensation, benefits, and\noverhead, excluding SBC $ 17 $ 18 6% $ 59 $ 54 (8)%\nProvision for credit losses - credit card\nrelated 11 17 55% 11 41 273%\nProvision for credit losses - brokerage\nrelated 3 6 100% 18 16 (11)%\nCustomer experience 4 4 —% 15 13 (13)%\nSBC 3 1 (67)% 6 5 (17)%\nOther 3 4 33% 10 11 10%\nTotal $ 41 $ 50 22% $ 119 $ 140 18%\nOperations costs increased by $9 million and $21 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nincreases of $6 million and $30 million of provision for credit card losses.\nMarketing\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nDigital marketing $ 11 $ 26 136 % $ 24 $ 85 254 %\nBrand marketing 2 5 150 % 13 32 146 %\nEmployee compensation, benefits, and\noverhead, excluding SBC 5 9 80 % 16 24 50 %\nRobinhood referral program 2 4 100 % 5 10 100 %\nSBC 1 3 200 % 3 6 100 %\nOther 7 12 71 % 18 33 83 %\nTotal $ 28 $ 59 111 % $ 79 $ 190 141 %\nMarketing costs increased by $31 million and $111 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher\nexpenses in digital marketing of $15 million and $61 million, brand marketing of $3 million and $19 million as well as other marketing of $5 million\nand $15 million, as we increased our investments in paid marketing channels and other marketing initiatives to promote our brand, products, and\nservices. In addition, employee compensation, benefits, and overhead increased by $4 million and $8 million driven by increased average\nheadcount to support increased marketing initiatives.\n50\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nEmployee compensation, benefits, and\noverhead, excluding SBC $ 54 $ 57 6 % $ 166 $ 175 5 %\nSBC excluding 2021 Founders Award\nCancellation 26 25 (4)% 129 65 (50)%\nLegal expenses 21 13 (38)% 80 62 (23)%\nOther professional fees 14 11 (21)% 30 34 13 %\nSettlements and penalties 107 13 (88)% 115 20 (83)%\nSBC related to 2021 Founders Award\nCancellation — — NM 485 — NM\nOther 8 14 75 % 31 29 (6)%\nTotal $ 230 $ 133 (42)% $ 1,036 $ 385 (63)%\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased by $97 million and $651 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to decreases of $94 million and $95 million in settlements and penalties and $8 million and $18 million in legal expenses\nassociated with certain historical regulatory matters. In addition, other SBC decreased by $1 million and $64 million attributed to stock awards\nbecoming fully vested in prior periods. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to the 2021 Founders Award\nCancellation of $485 million which occurred during the first quarter in 2023.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024 % Change 2023 2024 % Change\nProvision for income taxes $ 10 $ 3 (70)% $ 9 $ 11 22 %\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the decrease in our\ncurrent U.S. federal and state taxes payable as a result of an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, offset by the\nchange in valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nProvision for income taxes increased by $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the increase in our\ncurrent U.S. federal and state taxes payable as a result of business growth, offset by the change in valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and\nstate deferred tax assets.\nIf the improvements in the U.S. operating results continue, we believe a reasonable probability exists that, within the next 24 months,\nsufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the U.S. valuation allowance would no\nlonger be required.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Other sources\nof future funds may include potential borrowing under our revolving lines of credit and potential issuance of new debt or equity. Our liquidity\nneeds are primarily to\n51\nTable of Contents\nsupport and invest in our core business, including investing in new ways to serve our customers, potentially seeking strategic acquisitions to\nleverage existing capabilities and further build our business, and for general capital needs (including capital requirements imposed by regulators\nand SROs and cash deposit and collateral requirements under the rules of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the NSCC, and the Options\nClearing Corporation (“OCC”)). Based on our current level of operations, we believe our primary sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our\ncurrent liquidity needs for the next 12 months.\nLiquid Assets\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.61 billion, which included a $750 million liquid investment portfolio of\navailable-for-sale securities. Held-to-maturity investments maturing within one year can also be a source of liquidity and were $527 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. See Note 6 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in\nthis Quarterly Report for further information.\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Credit Card Funding Trust\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had a total of $3.00 billion in committed revolving credit facilities and a borrowing amount up to $100 million\nfor our Credit Card Funding Trust. See Note 10 - Financing Activities and Off-Balance Sheet Risk, to our unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in this Quarterly Report for further information.\nCommitments\nThe following table summarizes our short- and long-term material cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024:\nPayments Due by Period\nRemainder of\n(in millions) Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter\nOperating lease commitments $ 125 $ 7 $ 47 $ 30 $ 41\nPurchase commitments(1) 740 130 582 27 1\nRobinhood match incentives commitments(2) 109 15 94 — —\nCredit Card Funding Trust borrowing principal and interest 94 — 94 — —\nTotal $ 1,068 $ 152 $ 817 $ 57 $ 42\n__________\n(1) Purchase commitments are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. These primarily relate to\ncommitments for cloud infrastructure and data services and business insurance.\n(2) Robinhood match incentives commitments represent non-cancelable future match payments on eligible cash deposits made by Robinhood Gold users. The future match\npayments are forfeited if deposits are not held on the platform during the specific earning period.\nIn addition to lease and purchase commitments, we have two committed financing agreements: one with a contractual term of 30 days and a\ndaily minimum commitment of $25 million and another with a contractual term of 21 days with a daily minimum commitment of $35 million.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries (RHF and RHS) are subject to Rule 15c3-1 (the \"SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule\") under the Exchange Act,\nadministered by the SEC and FINRA, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined. Net capital and the related net capital\nrequirements may fluctuate on a daily basis. RHS and RHF compute net capital under the alternative method as permitted by the SEC Uniform\nNet Capital Rule.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the net capital, capital requirements, and excess net capital of RHS and RHF as of periods presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNet Capital in Excess\nof Required Net\n(in millions) Net Capital Required Net Capital Capital\nRHS $ 2,597 $ 121 $ 2,476\nRHF $ 297 $ 0.25 $ 297\nAs of September 30, 2024, our broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory capital requirements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 221 $ 1,243\nInvesting activities (579) (182)\nFinancing activities (619) (167)\nCash provided by operating activities increased $1.02 billion primarily driven by increased net income of $1.07 billion, partially offset by a\ndecrease in non-cash add-backs driven by higher SBC expense in 2023 as a result of the 2021 Founders Award Cancellation. Further, changes\nin operating assets and liabilities had a positive impact on our cash provided by operating activities. These changes primarily included an\nincrease in securities loaned due to continuous growth in our securities lending program. The increase was offset by an increase in receivables\nfrom users, net due to higher customer margin balance, driven by increased customer activities.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $397 million compared to the prior period. The change was primarily driven by a decrease of\n$182 million from fewer purchases of held-to-maturity investments and an increase of $272 million related to proceeds from maturities of held-to-\nmaturity investments.\nCash used in financing activities decreased $452 million compared to the prior period primarily driven by a $511 million decrease in funds\nspent on common stock repurchases and $95 million in borrowings under our Credit Card Funding Trust to purchase credit card receivables. The\ndecrease was partially offset by an increase of $146 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the\ncompany’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the\nuse of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\n53\nTable of Contents\nunderstanding our results. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon\ninformation presently available. Actual results might differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or\nconditions.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared\nto those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates”\nin our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 1 of Part I, “Unaudited Financial Statements — Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of\nfluctuations in interest rates and market prices. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is\ndescribed below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to interest revenue earned on our interest-earning assets that are subject to\nfloating interest rates. Interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and the\nfederal funds rate. We use a net interest sensitivity analysis, which applies hypothetical 50, 100 or 150 basis point increases or decreases in\ninterest rates to the period end balances of our interest-earning assets and liabilities, including interest rate sensitive off-balance sheet amounts\nrelated to our Coastal Bank Program Agreement, to evaluate the effect that changes in interest rates might have on total net revenues, net\nincome (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects, over the next 12 months.\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not change as a result of\nsimulated changes in interest rates. Additionally, the analysis does not factor in any assumptions on the effect simulated changes in interest\nrates would have on trading activities across our platforms. For our Cash Sweep program, we earn a net interest spread on Cash Sweep\nbalances based on the interest rate offered by the partner banks less the interest rate given to users, as stated in our program terms. For the\nvast majority of the Cash Sweep program, we have the ability to manage our net interest spread by adjusting the rate given to users as a result\nof changes in rates received from partner banks. As such, we do not consider the Cash Sweep balance to be subject to short-term interest rate\nrisk and the sensitivity analysis excludes Cash Sweep balances.\nThe impact to total net revenues, net income (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects, as a result of a hypothetical interest rate\nchange at the end of each reporting period would be:\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2023 2024\n50 basis point $ 66 $ 86\n100 basis point 132 171\n150 basis point 198 257\nThe change to total net revenues, net income (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects, would be the same as total net\nrevenues includes net interest revenue, which captures both the impact of\n54\nTable of Contents\nany incremental interest revenue and interest expense, and changes in interest rates do not have a direct impact on operating expenses. The\nimpact related to the change in interest rates is positively correlated, linear, and proportional. The change in the sensitivity analysis from prior\nyear is in line with the change in interest-earning asset balances.\nOur investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We invest in highly-\nrated debt securities that were considered held-to-maturity investments with average duration in the portfolio less than a year and the maximum\nmaturity of two years. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a\nsensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis\npoint parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest\nrates across all maturities would not be significant. Any losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nWe also have exposure to changes in interest rates related to our variable-rate credit facilities. See Note 10 - Financing Activities and Off-\nBalance Sheet Risk, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for further information. However, as\nthere were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024, we had limited financial exposure associated with\nchanges in interest rates as of such date.\nWe have established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which formalizes our approach to managing interest rate risk\narising in connection with the operation of our businesses. The policy sets forth policies and procedures pursuant to which we will identify\ninterest rate risk exposure, identify and implement appropriate hedging strategies and hedging instruments, and analyze the effectiveness of our\nhedging strategies. Interest rate instruments will be used for hedging purposes only and not for speculation.\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, our analysis might not precisely\nestimate the actual impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenues. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance\ngrowth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management\nstrategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.\nMarket-Related Credit Risk\nWe are indirectly exposed to equity securities risk in connection with securities collateralizing margin receivables, as well as risk related to\nour securities lending activities. We manage risk on margin and securities-based lending by requiring customers to maintain collateral in\ncompliance with internal and, as applicable, regulatory guidelines. We monitor required margin levels daily and require our customers to deposit\nadditional collateral, or to reduce positions, when necessary. We continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration,\nlarge orders or positions, and other activities that indicate increased risk to us. We manage risks associated with our securities lending activities\nby requiring credit approvals for counterparties, by monitoring the market value of securities loaned and collateral values for securities borrowed\non a daily basis, by requiring additional cash as collateral for securities loaned or return of collateral for securities borrowed when necessary, and\nby participating in a risk-sharing program offered through the OCC.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our CEO and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,”\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e)\n55\nTable of Contents\nand 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls\nand procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the\nExchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and\nmanagement necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such\nevaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n56\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nITEM 1.

RISK FACTORS\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, as well as the other information included in this Quarterly Report, including our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.” Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these\nrisks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of\nor that we currently see as immaterial might also adversely affect our business. Some statements in this Quarterly Report, including statements\nin the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those described at length in the Risk Factors section below. We\nconsider the following to be our most material risks:\n• We might not grow in line with historical rates.\n• We have limited operating experience at our current scale, which subjects us to a number of uncertainties, risks, and difficulties that\ncould adversely affect our business.\n• Our results of operations and other operating metrics fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult to predict.\n• We have incurred operating losses in the past and might not be profitable in the future.\n• Factors that affect transaction-based revenue — such as reduced spreads in securities pricing, reduced levels of trading activity\ngenerally, changes in our business relationships with market makers, and any new regulation of, or any bans on, PFOF and similar\npractices — might result in reduced profitability, increased compliance costs, and negative publicity.\n• We are directly and indirectly exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, and rapidly changing interest rate environments will and could\ncontinue to reduce our net interest revenues and otherwise result in reduced profitability.\n• As registered broker-dealers, we are subject to “best execution” requirements under SEC guidelines and FINRA rules. We could be\npenalized if we fail to comply with these requirements and these requirements might be modified in the future in a way that could harm\nour business.\n• Unfavorable media coverage and other events that harm our brand and reputation could adversely affect our revenue and the size,\nengagement, and loyalty of our customer base.\n• Our business has been and might continue to be harmed by changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact global\nfinancial markets, or by a systemic market event.\n• Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract and retain senior management and\nother highly skilled personnel.\n• We recently started operating in certain international markets and plan to further expand our international operations, which exposes us\nto significant new risks, and our international expansion efforts might not succeed.\n58\nTable of Contents\n• Our business is subject to extensive, complex and changing laws and regulations, and related regulatory proceedings and investigations.\nChanges in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our business.\n• We have been subject to regulatory investigations, actions, and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings\nin the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a materially adverse\nmanner.\n• We are involved in numerous litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could expose us to\nsignificant liability and reputational harm.\n• We operate in highly competitive markets, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may have products and\nservices that are more appealing than ours to our current or potential customers.\n• If we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, or if our customers decrease their use of our products and services, our\nrevenue will decline.\n• If we fail to provide and monetize new and innovative products and services that are adopted by customers, our business may become\nless competitive and our revenue might decline.\n• Our products and services rely on software and systems that are highly technical and have been, and may in the future be, subject to\ninterruption, instability, and other potential flaws due to software errors, design defects, and other processing, operational, and\ntechnological failures, whether internal or external.\n• We rely on third parties to perform some key functions, and their failure to perform those functions could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n• We are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and processes. These technologies may present business, compliance,\nand reputational risks.\n• Our business could be materially and adversely affected by a cybersecurity breach or other attack involving our computer systems or\ndata or those of our customers or third-party or fourth-party service providers.\n• If we do not maintain the net capital levels required by regulators, our broker-dealer business may be restricted and we may be fined or\nsubject to other disciplinary or corrective actions.\n• Our compliance and risk management policies and procedures as a regulated financial services company might not be fully effective in\nidentifying or mitigating compliance and risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\n• The prices of most cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of various cryptocurrencies might cause uncertainty\nin the market and could negatively impact trading volumes of cryptocurrencies, and we may not effectively identify, prevent or mitigate\ncryptocurrency market risks, any of which would adversely affect the success of our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n• In the United States, any particular cryptocurrency’s status as a “security” is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and if we have not\nproperly characterized one or more cryptocurrencies, we might be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other\npenalties.\n• Cryptocurrency laws, regulations, and accounting standards are often difficult to interpret and are rapidly evolving in ways that are\ndifficult to predict. Changes in these laws and regulations,\n59\nTable of Contents\nor our failure to comply with them, could negatively impact cryptocurrency trading on our platforms.\n• Our support for Crypto Transfers, Robinhood Wallet, Robinhood Connect, the Robinhood Cash Card, Robinhood Credit, Spending\nAccount, and other payments and spending services increases the risk that our platforms could be exploited to facilitate illegal\npayments, potentially resulting in loss of customer assets, customer disputes, and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and\nadversely impact trading volumes and transaction-based revenues.\n• Substantial future issuances or sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could result in significant dilution to our\nstockholders and such issuances or sales, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall.\n• The multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our founders, which limits your ability to\ninfluence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. In addition, the Founders’ Voting Agreement (as defined\nbelow) and any future issuances of our Class C common stock could prolong the duration of our founders’ voting control.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe might not grow in line with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly since our founding. However, the circumstances that accelerated the growth of our business in the past, including an\nextended period of general macroeconomic growth in the U.S., as well as growth in the financial services and technology industries, have\nslowed in recent years and may not exist in the future. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or\nannual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics or key business metrics growth in future periods.\nWe might experience declines in the growth of our business (or negative growth) as a result of a number of factors, including slowing\ndemand for our platforms, insufficient growth in the number of customers that utilize our platforms, declines in the level of usage of our platforms\nby existing customers, macroeconomic factors, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure to continue\nto capitalize on growth opportunities, including as a result of our inability to scale to meet such growth and economic conditions that have, in\nsome instances, and could continue to reduce financial activity and the maturation of our business, among others. Any failure to successfully\naddress these risks and challenges as we encounter them, will negatively affect our growth. If our revenue growth rate continues to decline,\ninvestors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited operating experience at our current scale, which subjects us to a number of uncertainties, risks, and difficulties that\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly, including continuing to introduce new products and services in our platforms, and have limited\noperating experience at our current scale, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and subjects us to a\nnumber of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for, model, and manage potential future growth and risks. As a result of the general\ndownturn in economic conditions and the U.S. equity markets in 2022, we announced two restructurings in April 2022 (the “April 2022\nRestructuring”) and August 2022 (the “August 2022 Restructuring”) that impacted approximately 1,100 employees and scaled back hiring plans.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts in the normal course of business, we continuously evaluate whether we are appropriately staffed to be cost\nefficient. From time to time we have reduced our staff in certain departments as we saw increased productivity and opportunities for greater\nefficiency under a leaner operating model while continuing to deliver great service and innovation for our customers.\n60\nTable of Contents\nSuch efforts to control costs have in the past resulted, and might in the future continue to result in reduced productivity and deteriorating\nworkforce morale, which can cause our business initiatives to suffer. However, if market conditions improve, we also face a risk that renewed\nbusiness growth could strain our existing resources, or that we are not able to effectively scale up in response, and we could experience ongoing\noperating difficulties in managing our business across numerous jurisdictions, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing a dispersed\nemployee base.\nWe have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly changing\nand heavily regulated industries, including challenges associated with achieving market acceptance of our products and services, attracting and\nretaining customers, and complying with laws and regulations (particularly those that are subject to evolving interpretations and application), as\nwell as increased competition and the complexities of managing expenses as we expand our business. We might fail to adequately address\nthese and other challenges we may face, and our business might be adversely affected if we do not manage these risks successfully.\nOur results of operations and other operating metrics fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult to predict.\nOur results of operations are heavily reliant on the level of trading activity on our platforms and Net Deposits. In the past, our results of\noperations and other operating metrics have fluctuated from quarter to quarter, including due to movements and trends in the underlying\nmarkets, changes in general economic conditions, interest in investing, and fluctuations in trading levels generally, each of which is outside our\ncontrol and will continue to be outside of our control. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations might not be\nmeaningful, and our past results of operations should not be relied on as indicators of future performance. Further, we are subject to additional\nrisks and uncertainties that are frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial condition and results of\noperations in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, including the occurrence of any of the risks described elsewhere in this\nRisk Factors section, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control. Factors contributing to quarterly fluctuations could\ninclude, among others:\n• our ability to retain and engage existing customers and attract new customers;\n• the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors, or other changes in the competitive landscape\nof our market;\n• volatility in the market generally or the occurrence of so-called “meme” trading in equities, options, cryptocurrencies, or commodity\ninterests (including event contracts) which can cause our trading volumes to fluctuate;\n• fluctuations in interest rates;\n• increases in marketing, sales, compensation (for example, due to increased hiring competition for highly skilled personnel), cloud\ninfrastructure, and other operating expenses that we might incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n• the timing and amount of non-cash expenses, such as SBC and asset impairments;\n• the success of our expansion into new markets;\n• trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for cryptocurrencies, which can be highly volatile;\n• ceasing support for certain cryptocurrencies on our RHC platform that the SEC or a court has asserted or determined are securities or\nproactively removing certain cryptocurrencies because they share similarities with such cryptocurrencies;\n61\nTable of Contents\n• changes in the public’s perception, adoption, and use of cryptocurrencies and other asset classes;\n• any inability of customers to place trades, due to system disruptions, outages, or trading restrictions;\n• any events that damage customer confidence in Robinhood, such as breaches of security or privacy;\n• the impacts of public health threats (including pandemics such as COVID-19), unemployment, and inflation; and\n• changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or\ninterpretations are issued, and might significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period.\nAny of the factors above or listed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, or the cumulative effect of some of those factors, could result in\nsignificant fluctuations in our results of operations.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and might not be profitable in the future.\nIn most full year periods since our inception, we have incurred operating losses. Although we have had several quarters of positive GAAP\nnet income since the beginning of 2023 and we generated higher total net revenues for 2023 compared to each of 2019 through 2022, we\nreported a GAAP net loss for full year 2023 and we might not be able to increase our revenue and/or further reduce our operating expenses by\nsufficient amounts to generate positive net income in the future.\nFactors that affect transaction-based revenue — such as reduced spreads in securities pricing, reduced levels of trading activity\ngenerally, changes in our business relationships with market makers, and any new regulation of, or any bans on, PFOF and similar\npractices — might result in reduced profitability, increased compliance costs, and negative publicity.\nA large portion of our revenue is transaction-based, in that we receive consideration in exchange for routing our users’ equity, option, and\ncryptocurrency trade orders to market makers for execution. With respect to equities and options trading, such fees are known as payment for\norder flow, or “PFOF.” With respect to cryptocurrency trading, we receive “Transaction Rebates.” Our transaction-based revenue is sensitive to\nand dependent on trading volumes and therefore tends to decline during periods in which we experience decreased levels of trading generally.\nComputer-generated buy/sell programs and other technological advances and regulatory changes in the marketplace might continue to tighten\nspreads on transactions, which could also lead to a decrease in our PFOF earned from market makers. For example, the SEC’s recent adoption\nof final rules (the “September 2024 Final Rules”) to, among other things, adopt an additional minimum pricing increment, or “tick size,” for the\nquoting of certain national market system (“NMS”) stocks under Rule 612 of Regulation NMS, reduce the access fee caps for protected\nquotations under Rule 610 of Regulation NMS and accelerate the implementation of such rules will make the information about smaller-sized\norders publicly available and result in the contraction of spreads across several securities, which we expect will lead to a decrease in the PFOF\nearned from such orders.In addition, the regulatory landscape involving cryptocurrencies is subject to change and is experiencing rapid\nevolution, and future regulatory actions or policies, including for instance, the assertion of jurisdiction by domestic and foreign regulators and\ngovernments over cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency markets, could reduce demand for cryptocurrency trading and might materially decrease\nour revenue derived from Transaction Rebates in absolute terms and as a proportion of our total revenues. In addition, to the extent that the SEC\nor a court asserts or determines that any cryptocurrencies supported by our RHC platform are securities, we might not continue to facilitate\ntrading of those cryptocurrencies in the U.S. (including ceasing support for such cryptocurrencies on our RHC platform, for instance, with respect\nto Cardano, Polygon, and Solana) or it might cause us to proactively remove certain cryptocurrencies from our RHC platform because they\nshare similarities with such cryptocurrencies.\n62\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Business Relationships with Market Makers\nOur PFOF and Transaction Rebate arrangements with market makers are a matter of practice and business understanding and not\ndocumented under binding contracts. If any of these market makers were unwilling to continue to receive orders from us or to pay us for those\norders (including, for example, as a result of unusually high volatility), we might have little to no recourse and, if there are no other market\nmakers that are willing to receive such orders from us or to pay us for such orders, or if we are unable to find replacement market makers in a\ntimely manner, our transaction-based revenue would be negatively impacted. This risk is particularly heightened for cryptocurrencies because\nfewer market makers are currently able to execute cryptocurrency trades. For instance, in May 2023, two prominent market makers announced\ntheir respective decisions to limit their offerings in cryptocurrency trading within the United States. Without additional market makers supporting\ncryptocurrencies entering the industry in the United States, the risk that we may be unable to find suitable market makers to support\ncryptocurrencies is increasingly heightened. Additionally, this risk is heightened for brokerage orders executed outside of regular market hours\nthrough Robinhood 24 Hour Market, as currently all brokerage trades executed overnight are routed through one market maker - Virtu Financial,\nInc. (“Virtu”). If Virtu becomes unwilling or unable to do business with us in the future, we may be unable to find additional market makers to\nsupport Robinhood 24 Hour Market, which could negatively impact our transaction-based revenue. Furthermore, if any of our market makers\ndecide to alter our fee structure, our transaction-based revenue could significantly decrease.\nAdditionally, disruptions in the services provided by our market makers, whether due to technical malfunctions, operational mishaps, or\nfinancial instability of the market makers, or external factors such as regulatory changes or market volatility, have in the past, and may in the\nfuture impair our ability to execute our client's orders. Should a market maker venue experience downtime or diminished performance,\nparticularly during peak trading hours, our ability to execute customer orders could be compromised and could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation of PFOF\nPFOF practices have drawn heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, the SEC, state regulators, and other regulatory and legislative\nauthorities. For example, in December 2020, we settled an SEC investigation into our best execution and PFOF practices and are defending\nputative class actions in federal district courts relating to the same factual allegations. Additionally, our PFOF practices were the subject of a line\nof critical questioning during a February 18, 2021 U.S. Congressional hearing related to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions, and since July\n2023, we have been cooperating with an investigation being conducted by the New York Attorney General concerning brokerage execution\nquality. We also face the risk that the SEC, other regulatory authorities, or legislative bodies might adopt additional regulation or legislation\nrelating to PFOF practices as a result of such heightened scrutiny or otherwise. For instance, in December 2022, the SEC proposed four\nseparate equity market structure rules (the “December 2022 Rule Proposals”) related to (i) best execution; (ii) order competition, including\nrequiring certain retail equity orders to be exposed in auctions before being internalized; (iii) order execution disclosure; and (iv) order tick size\nand fee caps. In September 2024, the SEC adopted the September 2024 Final Rules, which related to (i) order execution disclosure and (ii)\norder tick size and fee caps. The adoption of the September 2024 Final Rules will make the information about smaller-sized orders publicly\navailable and result in the contraction of spreads across several securities, which we expect will lead to a decrease in the PFOF earned from\nsuch orders. Although these final and remaining proposed rules related to market structure design do not ban PFOF, the remaining December\n2022 Rule Proposals introduce new requirements and will have the indirect effect of making PFOF more difficult or impossible to earn and\ncondensing the revenues we could theoretically earn. Any new or heightened PFOF regulation, including the September 2024 Final Rules and\nthe remaining December 2022 Rule Proposals if adopted as proposed, will result in increased compliance costs and otherwise could materially\ndecrease our transaction-based revenue, might make it more difficult for us to expand our platforms in certain\n63\nTable of Contents\njurisdictions, and could require us to make significant changes to our revenue model, which changes might not be successful. Because some of\nour competitors either do not engage in PFOF or derive a lower percentage of their revenues from PFOF than we do, any such heightened\nregulation or a ban of PFOF could have an outsized impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, depending on the nature of any new\nrequirements, heightened regulation could also increase our risk of potential regulatory violations and civil litigation, which could result in fines or\nother penalties, as well as negative publicity.\nRisks Related to Negative Publicity Associated with PFOF or our Market Makers\nAdditionally, any negative publicity surrounding PFOF or Transaction Rebate practices generally, or our implementation of these practices,\ncould harm our brand and reputation. For example, as a result of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions, we faced allegations that our decision to\ntemporarily prevent our customers from purchasing specified securities was influenced by our relationship with certain market makers.\nFurthermore, as registered broker-dealers, market makers must comply with rules and regulations that are generally intended to prohibit them\nfrom taking advantage of information they obtain while executing orders (e.g., through the prohibition on “front running”). Market makers also\nhave a duty to seek “best execution” of customers’ equity and option orders we send to them. If the market makers we use to execute our\ncustomer’s equity and option trades were to violate such rules and regulations and use this data for their own benefit in violation of applicable\nrules and regulations, it could result in negative publicity for us by association. Developments in any proposals related to the regulation of PFOF\nor market structure design have generated and might continue to generate negative publicity associated with PFOF. For example, the intra-day\ntrading price of our Class A common stock fell as much as 5.3% on December 14, 2022, the day the December 2022 Rule Proposals were\nannounced.\nAdditionally, if our customers or potential customers believe that they might get better execution quality (including better price improvement)\ndirectly from stock exchanges or from our competitors that have different execution arrangements, or if our customers perceive our PFOF\npractices to create a conflict of interest between us and them, or if they begin to disfavor the specific market markers with which we do business\ndue to any negative media attention, they might come to have an adverse view of our business model and might decide to limit or cease the use\nof our platforms. Some customers might prefer to invest through our competitors that do not engage in PFOF or Transaction Rebate practices or\nengage in them differently than do we. Any such loss of customer engagement as a result of any negative publicity associated with PFOF or\nTransaction Rebate practices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are directly and indirectly exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, and rapidly changing interest rate environments will and could\ncontinue to reduce our net interest revenues and otherwise result in reduced profitability.\nA large portion of our revenue comes from interest income earned from our corporate cash and investment portfolio, our securities lending\nactivities, cash sweep, and from interest-rate sensitive assets, including receivables from users’ margin-borrowing and other assets underlying\nthe customer balances we hold on our balance sheets as customer accounts. Interest rates are the key driver of our net interest income and are\nsubject to many factors beyond our control. As interest rates increased starting in 2022, interest income has contributed an increasing share of\nour total net revenues, net income (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects. Reductions in interest rates and a return to a low\ninterest rate environment would negatively impact (and the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in September 2024 will negatively impact)\nour total net revenues, net income (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects, and adversely impact our customers’ returns on their\ncash deposits. Changes to the level or mix of interest earning balances could also negatively impact our total net revenues, net income (loss),\nand cash flows, prior to any tax income effects, if customers react to the rising interest rate environment by moving cash that would have\notherwise been spent on services or products with higher revenue potential for Robinhood into Robinhood accounts that offer customers high\ninterest rates. For a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk and an estimate of how hypothetical 50, 100 or 150 basis point increases or\ndecreases in interest rates to the period end balances of our interest-earning assets and liabilities\n64\nTable of Contents\ncould affect our total net revenues, net income (loss), and cash flows, prior to any income tax effects, see “Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk” elsewhere in this report.\nHigher interest rates also lead to higher payment obligations by our customers to us and to their creditors under mortgage, credit card, and\nother consumer and merchant loans, which might reduce our customers’ ability to satisfy their obligations to us, including failing to pay for\nsecurities purchased, meet minimum credit card payments, deliver securities sold, or meet margin calls, and therefore lead to increased\ndelinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loan and interest receivables, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely impact our customers’ general spending levels and ability and willingness to invest and spend\nthrough our platforms.\nAs registered broker-dealers, we are subject to “best execution” requirements under SEC guidelines and FINRA rules. We could be\npenalized if we fail to comply with these requirements and these requirements might be modified in the future in a way that could\nharm our business.\nAs registered broker-dealers, we are subject to “best execution” requirements under SEC guidelines and FINRA rules, which requires us to\nobtain the best reasonably available terms for customer orders. We have in the past and continue to be subject to investigations related to our\nbest execution practices. For example, as previously disclosed, in December 2019 and 2020, we settled a FINRA disciplinary action and an SEC\ninvestigation, respectively, that related to our best execution practices. We face additional investigations and/or a risk of penalties in the future\nrelated to our best execution practices.\nWe also might be adversely affected in the future by regulatory changes related to our obligations with regard to best execution. In particular,\nreceipt of PFOF and best execution requirements have drawn heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, the SEC, and other regulatory and\nlegislative authorities, who have at times alleged that PFOF arrangements, like those we have with our market makers, can result in harm to\ncustomer execution quality. For instance, one of the remaining December 2022 Rule Proposals relates to best execution and proposes to\nenhance the existing regulatory framework concerning the duty of best execution by, among other things, requiring additional policies and\nprocedures for broker-dealers engaging in certain conflicted transactions with retail customers. There is a risk that these bodies might adopt\nadditional regulation relating to PFOF practices and best execution requirements as a result of such heightened scrutiny or otherwise. Any such\nregulations could have a material adverse impact on our business and one of our primary sources of revenue.\nWe might need additional capital to provide liquidity and support business growth and objectives, and this capital might not be\navailable to us on reasonable terms, if at all, might result in stockholder dilution, or might be delayed or prohibited by applicable\nregulations.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our securities brokerage and our money services business operations, including key functions\nsuch as transaction settlement, custody requirements, and margin lending. The SEC and FINRA also have stringent rules with respect to the\nmaintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash\ngenerated by customer activity, as well as from external debt and equity financing. Despite these resources, increases in the number of\ncustomers, and fluctuations in customer cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of customer\ndeposits, could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. We might be adversely affected in the future by regulatory changes related to our\nobligations with regard to capital maintenance requirements. For example, in July 2023, the SEC proposed amendments to the broker-dealer\ncustomer protection rule (SEC Rule 15c3-3) to require certain broker-dealers to compute their customer and broker-dealer reserve deposit\nrequirements, and to make any required deposits, daily rather than weekly. Any such amendments could make it more difficult for us to comply\nwith these regulations. Additionally, there is not definitive guidance on whether or how these rules may apply to cryptocurrencies, and we might\nbe adversely affected in the future if the SEC determines that they do. See the discussion of SAB 121 below in “Cryptocurrency laws,\nregulations, and accounting standards are often difficult to interpret and are rapidly evolving in ways that are difficult to\n65\nTable of Contents\npredict. Changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could negatively impact cryptocurrency trading on our\nplatforms.”\nIn addition, our clearing and carrying broker-dealer is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements under the rules of the\nclearinghouses in which it participates (including DTC, NSCC, and OCC), which requirements fluctuate significantly from time to time based\nupon the nature and volume of customers’ trading activity and volatility in the market or individual securities. If we fail to meet any such deposit\nrequirements, our ability to settle trades through the clearinghouse may be suspended or we might be forced to restrict trading in certain stocks\nin order to limit clearinghouse deposit requirements. For example, from January 28 to February 5, 2021, due to increased deposit requirements\nimposed on our clearing and carrying broker-dealer by NSCC in response to unprecedented market volatility, particularly in certain securities, we\nimplemented the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. This resulted in negative media attention, customer dissatisfaction, reputational harm,\nlitigation, and regulatory and U.S. Congressional inquiries and investigations, as well as capital raising by us in order to lift the trading restrictions\nwhile remaining in compliance with our net capital and deposit requirements. We face a risk that similar events could occur in the future and, if\nwe are unable to satisfy our deposit requirements, the clearinghouse may cease to act for us and may liquidate our unsettled clearing portfolio.\nWe may also need to hold capital and make deposits with respect to event contracts, including presidential election event contracts, in\naccordance with applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulations and ForecastEX, LLC’s Rulebook for Robinhood\nDerivatives, LLC.\nA reduction in our liquidity position could reduce our customers’ confidence in us, which could result in the withdrawal of customer assets\nand loss of customers, or could cause us to fail to satisfy broker-dealer or other regulatory capital guidelines, which may result in immediate\nsuspension of securities activities, regulatory prohibitions against certain business practices, increased regulatory inquiries and reporting\nrequirements, increased costs, fines, penalties or other sanctions, including suspension or expulsion by the SEC, FINRA or other SROs or state\nregulators, and could ultimately lead to the liquidation of our broker-dealers or other regulated entities. Factors which might adversely affect our\nliquidity positions include temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of\nsegregated cash balances, timing differences between cryptocurrency transaction settlements between us and our cryptocurrency market\nmakers and between us and our cryptocurrency customers, fluctuations in cash held in customer accounts, a significant increase in our margin\nlending activities, increased regulatory capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a\nloss of market or customer confidence resulting in unanticipated and/or excessive withdrawals or redemptions, or a suspension of redemptions\nor withdrawals of customer assets.\nWe might also need additional capital to continue to support our business and any future growth and to respond to competitive challenges,\nincluding the need to promote our products and services, develop new products and services, enhance our existing products, services and\noperating infrastructure, acquire and invest in complementary businesses and technologies, and to fund payments on our obligations at the\nparent company level, such as the income tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the vesting and/or settlement of our\noutstanding RSUs, and any debt obligations we might incur. To meet liquidity needs at the parent level, we might need to rely on dividends,\ndistributions and other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory and other legal restrictions might limit our ability to transfer funds to or from\nsome subsidiaries. For example, under FINRA rules applicable to RHS, a dividend of over 10% of a member firm’s excess net capital must not\nbe paid without FINRA’s prior written approval.\nWhen available cash is not sufficient, we might seek to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, such\nadditional funding might not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all, and our inability to obtain additional funding when needed could have\nan adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities, our\nstockholders could suffer significant dilution, and the new shares could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our current\nstockholders. Any debt financing could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational\nmatters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue future business opportunities.\n66\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable media coverage and other events that harm our brand and reputation could adversely affect our revenue and the size,\nengagement, and loyalty of our customer base.\nOur brand and our reputation are two of our most important assets. Our ability to attract, build trust with, engage, and retain existing and\nattract new customers might be adversely affected by events that harm our brand and reputation, such as public complaints and unfavorable\nmedia coverage about us, our platforms, and our customers, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents.\nWe receive a high volume of media coverage, which has included, and might continue to include, negative coverage regarding our products\nand services and the risk of our customers’ misuse or misunderstanding of our products and services, inappropriate or otherwise unauthorized\nbehavior by our customers and litigation or regulatory activity. In addition, given our public profile, any unanticipated system disruptions, outages,\ntechnical or security-related incidents, or other performance problems relating to our platforms, such as the March 2020 Outages, the partial\nservice outages and degraded service on our RHC cryptocurrency platform from time to time in mid-April and early May 2021 caused by a\nsurging demand for cryptocurrency trading (the “April-May 2021 Disruptions”), or the November 2021 Data Security Incident are likely to receive\nextensive media attention. Furthermore, any negative experiences our customers have in connection with their use of our products and services,\nincluding as a result of any such performance problems, could diminish customer confidence in us and our products and services, which could\nresult in unfavorable media coverage or publicity. For example, we received customer complaints and significant media attention as a result of\nthe Early 2021 Trading Restrictions.\nDamage to our brand and reputation could also be caused by:\n• cybersecurity attacks, privacy or data security breaches, or other security incidents, payment disruptions or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our platforms;\n• actual or alleged illegal, negligent, reckless, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team, our other\nemployees or contractors, our customers or third-party service providers or partners as well as complaints or negative publicity about\nsuch individuals or companies;\n• future restructurings or any similar such reductions or activities in the future;\n• any repeat imposition of temporary trading restrictions (similar to our Early 2021 Trading Restrictions), or any outright failure to meet our\ndeposit requirements;\n• litigation involving, or regulatory actions or investigations into, our platforms or our business;\n• any failures to comply with legal, tax and regulatory requirements;\n• any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity;\n• any regulatory action that results in changes to, or prohibits us from offering, certain features, products or services;\n• any new policies, features, products, or services, or changes to our policies, features, products, or services, that customers or others\nperceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our values or mission, or not clearly articulated;\n• a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\n• inadequate or unsatisfactory customer support experiences;\n67\nTable of Contents\n• negative responses by customers or regulators to our business model or to particular features, products or services;\n• a failure to adapt to new or changing customer preferences;\n• our decision to offer products viewed by some as controversial, such as presidential election event contracts;\n• a prolonged weakness in popular equities or cryptocurrencies specifically or in U.S. or international equity and cryptocurrency markets\ngenerally, or a sustained downturn in the U.S. or international economies; and\n• any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent the resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us\nor our industry as a whole.\nThese and other events could negatively impact the willingness of our existing customers, and potential new customers, to do business with\nus, which could adversely affect our trading volumes and number of Funded Customers, as well as our ability to recruit and retain personnel, any\nof which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock. For instance, on November 8, 2022 (the day that FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), a major international cryptocurrency exchange,\nhalted all non-fiat customer withdrawals from its platform), the intra-day trading price of our Class A common stock fell as much as 18%. And in\nDecember 2022, shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, and following the bankruptcies of several other major\ncryptocurrency trading venues and lending platforms earlier in 2022, including Three Arrows Capital, Ltd., Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc., and\nCelsius Network LLC (“Celsius”) (collectively, the “2022 Crypto Bankruptcies”), we received an investigative subpoena from the SEC regarding,\namong other topics, RHC’s cryptocurrency listings, custody of cryptocurrencies, and platform operations.\nWe could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one or more of the financial institutions that we use fails\nor is taken over by the FDIC.\nWe maintain cash and investment accounts, as well as restricted cash as certificates of deposits for facility leases and other contractual\nobligations, at multiple financial institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the FDIC. In spring 2023, certain\nU.S. banks failed and were taken over by the FDIC (the “2023 Banking Events”). If any of the financial institutions where we hold significant\ndeposits were to fail or be taken over by the FDIC, our ability to access such accounts has in the past and could be in the future temporarily or\npermanently limited, which could adversely affect our business. In particular, while we have taken steps to help ensure that the loss of all or a\nsignificant portion of any uninsured amount would not have an adverse effect on our ability to pay our operational expenses or make other\npayments, the failure of a financial institution where we hold significant deposits has in the past and may in the future require us to move funds to\nanother bank, which could cause a temporary delay in making payments to our vendors and employees, or under other contractual\narrangements, and cause other operational inconveniences. Additionally, any losses or delay in access to funds as a result of such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to meet contractual obligations, earnings, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price.\nOur business has been and might continue to be harmed by changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact global\nfinancial markets, or by a systemic market event.\nAs we are a financial services company, our business, results of operations, and reputation are directly and indirectly affected by elements\nbeyond our control, such as economic and political conditions including unemployment rates, inflation, tax and interest rates, geopolitical\nconflicts, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and recent ongoing events in the Middle East, financial market volatility (such as we\nexperienced during the COVID-19 pandemic), significant increases in the volatility or trading volume of\n68\nTable of Contents\nparticular securities, cryptocurrencies, or commodity interests (such as we experienced during the meme stock events of early 2021 and the\nDogecoin surge of mid-2021), broad trends in business and finance, actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance\nby third-party financial institutions or transactional counterparties (such as the 2023 Banking Events), changes in volume of securities,\ncryptocurrencies, or commodity interest trading generally (such as the bear markets that developed for equities and crypto in the second quarter\nof 2022 and continued into 2023 (the “2022 Bear Markets”)) and changes in the markets in which such transactions occur (such as following the\n2022 Crypto Bankruptcies), and changes in how such transactions are processed. These elements can arise suddenly and the full impact of\nsuch conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results or remain uncertain indefinitely. Because a large percentage of our\ncustomers are first time investors, we might be disproportionately affected by declines in investor confidence caused by adverse economic\nconditions. A prolonged market weakness, such as a slowdown causing reduced trading volume in securities, derivatives, or cryptocurrency\nmarkets, has resulted, and could result in the future in reduced revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. For example, as a result of the 2022 Bear Markets, for fiscal year 2022, our daily revenue trades for options, equities, and crypto\ndeclined by 33%, 49%, and 75%, compared to fiscal year 2021. Conversely, significant upturns in such markets or conditions might cause\nindividuals to be less proactive in seeking ways to improve the returns on their trading or investment decisions and, thus, decrease the demand\nfor our products and services.\nAdditionally, concerns regarding the U.S. and/or international financial systems, such as in connection with the 2023 Banking Events, could\nresult in less favorable commercial financing terms available to us, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating\ncovenants, or systemic limitations on our access to credit and liquidity sources.\nAny of these changes could cause our future performance to be uncertain or unpredictable, and could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract and retain senior management\nand other highly skilled personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to identify, attract, develop, integrate and retain qualified and highly skilled\npersonnel. In particular, our Co-Founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, has been critical to the development and execution of our business, vision,\nand strategic direction. In addition, we have heavily relied, and expect we will continue to heavily rely, on the services and performance of our\nsenior management team, which provides leadership, contributes to the core areas of our business and helps us to efficiently execute our\nbusiness. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with some of our key personnel, most of these agreements have no specific\nduration and are terminable by either party at-will and our senior management team has experienced recent changes. We do not maintain key\nperson life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nWe also might not be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. In particular,\nthere continues to be particularly high competition in the San Francisco Bay Area for software engineers, computer scientists and other technical\npersonnel. Given our heavy emphasis on SBC, the performance of our stock price has in the past had, and could continue to have a significant\nimpact on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate highly skilled personnel. Additionally, our working model may negatively impact our ability to\nretain and recruit highly skilled personnel, especially to the extent other companies continue to allow more flexible remote working models.\nAttrition and workforce reorganizations and reductions have also and might continue to adversely affect our reputation among job seekers,\ndemoralize our remaining employees, and result in a loss of institutional know-how, reduced productivity, slower customer service response,\nreduced effectiveness of internal compliance and risk-mitigation programs, and cancellations of or delays in completing new product\ndevelopments and other strategic projects. For example, in the periods immediately following the April 2022 Restructuring and August 2022\nRestructuring, we experienced higher rates of voluntary\n69\nTable of Contents\nemployee attrition and declines in reported employee job satisfaction. We might continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly\nskilled employees with appropriate qualifications.\nWe believe that a critical component of our efforts to attract and retain employees has been our corporate culture of innovation. We have\ninvested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we continue to expand internationally, we will face new challenges to maintain\nour corporate culture of innovation among a larger number of geographically dispersed and remote employees, as well as other service\nproviders. Failure to preserve our company culture could harm our ability to retain and recruit personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, integrate, retain, or effectively replace our key employees and qualified and highly skilled personnel, our ability to\neffectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives will decline, and our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nFuture acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, products, technologies or specialized employees could require significant\nmanagement attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and might continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in, specialized employees or\nother compatible companies, products, or technologies. We also have entered into and might continue to enter into relationships with other\nbusinesses in order to expand our products and services. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and\nour ability to close these transactions might be subject to third-party approvals, such as governmental and other regulatory approvals, which are\nbeyond our control, and may take longer than expected to be obtained, if at all.\nFor example, in April 2022 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ziglu Limited (“Ziglu”), a U.K.-based electronic money institution and\ncrypto asset firm. However, as a result of prolonged regulatory uncertainty, after careful consideration, we notified Ziglu of the termination of the\nagreement in February 2023. In connection with the termination of the agreement, we took a $12 million impairment charge, in addition to\nsuffering losses from legal fees and other expenses. Additionally, because we had expected Ziglu’s team and technology to help accelerate our\ninternational expansion, the termination of the deal delayed our initial plans to expand our operations in Europe, particularly with respect to\ncryptocurrency trading. Furthermore, in June 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Bitstamp, a global cryptocurrency exchange with\nretail and institutional investors, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect Bitstamp and its team will\nhelp us accelerate our international expansion with respect to cryptocurrency trading, however, our ability to close this transaction is subject to\ncustomary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and if we are unable to complete this transaction, we could be subject to losses\nfrom legal fees and other expenses.\nIn general, our efforts to grow through acquisitions are subject to the risks that we might be unable to find suitable acquisition or investment\ncandidates or to complete acquisitions on favorable terms or in a timely manner, if at all. Moreover, these kinds of acquisitions or investments\ncan result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures prior to and following closing, including disrupting our ongoing operations,\ndiverting management from their primary responsibilities, subjecting us to additional liabilities and/or compliance obligations, increasing our\nexpenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire businesses or technologies, we\nmight not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, products, and technologies successfully or face challenges in doing so, or\neffectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment might not\nbe realized, the acquisition or investment might not perform in accordance with expectations, and we might be exposed to unknown liabilities.\nIn connection with these types of transactions, we might issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders, use cash that\nwe might need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on\n70\nTable of Contents\nterms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse\nbusiness cultures, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges.\nWe recently started operating in certain international markets and plan to further expand our international operations, which exposes\nus to significant new risks, and our international expansion efforts might not succeed.\nWe currently only offer select services to the public outside the United States in certain jurisdictions, including brokerage services in the UK\nthrough Robinhood UK, Ltd., crypto services in select jurisdictions in the EU through Robinhood Europe, UAB (“RHEC”), and our Robinhood\nWallet, which is available in over 150 countries and offered through our Cayman Islands subsidiary, Robinhood Non-Custodial Ltd. We also\nexpect that our pending acquisition of Bitstamp, if completed, will help us accelerate our international expansion, including across the EU, in the\nU.K. and in certain other countries.\nWe intend to continue expanding our operations outside of the United States. International expansion requires significant resources and\nmanagement attention and subjects us to additional regulatory, economic, operational, and political risks on top of those we already face in the\nUnited States. There are significant risks and costs inherent in establishing and doing business in international markets, including:\n• difficulty establishing and managing international entities, offices, and/or operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure,\nand legal and compliance costs associated with operations, entities, and/or people in different countries or regions;\n• the need to understand, interpret and comply with local laws, regulations and customs in multiple jurisdictions, including laws and\nregulations governing cryptocurrency-related, broker-dealer, money transmitter, or regulated entity practices, some of which might\nrequire permissions, registrations, authorizations, licenses or consents, or might be different from, or conflict with, those of other\njurisdictions or foreign cybersecurity, data privacy or labor and employment laws;\n• the additional complexities of any merger or acquisition activity internationally, which would be new for us and could subject us to\nadditional regulatory scrutiny or approvals;\n• the need to adapt, localize, and position our products for specific countries (also known as “product-market fit”);\n• increased exposure to foreign fraud vectors;\n• increased competition from local providers of similar products and services;\n• challenges of obtaining, maintaining, protecting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights abroad, including the challenge of\nextending or obtaining third-party intellectual property rights to use various technologies in new countries;\n• the need to offer customer support and other aspects of our offering (including websites, articles, blog posts, and customer support\ndocumentation) in various languages or locations;\n• compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and equivalent anti-money\nlaundering and sanctions rules and requirements in local markets, by us, our employees, and our business partners;\n• the need to recruit and manage staff in new countries and regions to support international operations, and comply with employment law,\ntax, payroll, and benefits requirements in multiple countries;\n71\nTable of Contents\n• the need to enter into new business partnerships with third-party service providers in order to provide products and services in the local\nmarket, or to meet regulatory obligations;\n• varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure, and increased or varying network and hosting service provider costs\nand differences in technology service delivery in different countries;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit conversion\nof other currencies into U.S. dollars;\n• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to requirements of or changes in the income\nand other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n• political or social change or unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which we operate.\nWe have limited experience with international legal and regulatory environments and market practices, and we might not be able to\npenetrate or successfully operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we might incur significant expenses as a result of our\ninternational expansion, and we might not be successful, which could lead to substantial losses.\nWe are exposed to funding transaction losses due to reversals or insufficient funds.\nSome of our products and services are paid for by electronic transfer from customers’ bank accounts which exposes us to risks associated\nwith reversals and insufficient funds. Unwinding of funds transfers due to reversals, and insufficient funds could arise from fraud, misuse,\nunintentional use, settlement delay, or other activities. Also, criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities,\nsuch as counterfeiting and fraud. If we are unable to collect and retain such amounts from the customer, or if the customer refuses or is unable,\ndue to bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us, we bear the loss for the amount of the chargeback, refund, or return.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to manage and mitigate these risks, we cannot be certain that such processes will be\neffective. Our failure to limit returns, including as a result of fraudulent transactions, could lead payment networks or our banking partners to\nrequire us to increase reserves, impose penalties on us, charge additional or higher fees, or terminate their relationships with us. These risks\nmay be amplified as we continue to expand our operations internationally and increase our exposure to foreign fraud vectors.\nOur working model, which allows a subset of our employees to work remotely, subjects us to heightened operational risks.\nWe currently have a large segment of employees who work remotely and are not required to come into the office on a daily basis. Allowing\nemployees to work remotely subjects us to heightened operational risks. For example, technologies in our employees’ homes might not be as\nrobust or effective as in our offices and could lead to lower productivity and/or increased vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks or other privacy or\ndata security incidents. There is no guarantee that the data security and privacy safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or\nthat we will not encounter risks associated with employees accessing company data and systems remotely. Additionally, in June 2024 FINRA’s\nnew Residential Supervisory Location Designation Rule became effective, under which the homes of certain of our employees who work\nremotely could be treated as “residential supervisory locations” subject to inspections on a regular periodic schedule, which in turn has required\ncertain operational changes and compliance adjustments. Non-compliance with the Residential Supervisory Location Designation Rule could\nsubject us to fines, penalties or enforcement actions. We also face\n72\nTable of Contents\nchallenges due to the need to operate with a dispersed and remote workforce, as well as increased costs related to business continuity\ninitiatives.\nAllowing for remote work has in the past made and may continue to make it more difficult for us to preserve our corporate culture of\ninnovation and our employees might have decreased opportunities to collaborate in meaningful ways. Further, we cannot guarantee that\nrequiring a subset of employees to work in-office, or allowing certain employees to continue to work remotely, will not have a negative impact on\nemployee morale or productivity. Any failure to overcome the challenges presented by our working model could harm our future success,\nincluding our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively, maintain product development velocity, and execute on our\nbusiness strategy.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\nOur business is subject to extensive, complex and changing laws and regulations, and related regulatory proceedings and\ninvestigations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards in the\nUnited States, the UK, the EU and in other countries and regions in which we operate. These laws, regulations, and standards govern numerous\nareas that are important to our business, and include, or might in the future include, those relating to all aspects of the securities industry,\nfinancial services, money transmission, the origination, marketing, servicing, and collection of consumer debt, foreign exchange, payments\nservices and products (such as payment processing, settlement services, and credit cards), cryptocurrency, derivatives, trading in shares and\nfractional shares, fraud detection, consumer protection, anti-money laundering, escheatment, sanctions regimes and export controls, data\nprivacy, data protection, data security, as well as climate risk and environmental impact, including with respect to disclosure of greenhouse gas\nemissions and other metrics related to climate change.\nThe substantial costs and uncertainties related to complying with these regulations continue to increase, and our introduction of new\nproducts or services, expansion of our business into new jurisdictions or subindustries, acquisitions of other businesses that operate in similar\nregulated spaces, or other actions that we may take might subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government or regulatory scrutiny.\nFor example, after launching Sherwood Media, our media subsidiary dedicated to providing news and information about the markets, economics,\nbusiness, technology, and the culture of money), we received inquiries from FINRA regarding Sherwood Media’s relationship to RHF. In addition,\nafter announcing in March 2024 the launch of the Robinhood Gold Card, which is currently offered via a waitlist through Robinhood Credit\nexclusively to Gold Subscribers and provides rewards via the Robinhood Gold Credit Card Rewards Program, we received requests for\ninformation from the MSD related to the Robinhood Gold subscription service and the Robinhood Gold Card. Regulations are intended to ensure\nthe integrity of financial markets, to maintain appropriate capitalization of broker-dealers and other financial services companies, and to protect\ncustomers and their assets. These regulations could limit our business activities through capital, customer protection, and market conduct\nrequirements, as well as restrictions on the activities that we are authorized to conduct.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and, despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, like all companies in our\nindustry, we must adapt to frequent changes in laws and regulations, and face complexity in interpreting and applying evolving laws and\nregulations to our business, heightened scrutiny of the conduct of financial services firms and increasing penalties for violations of applicable\nlaws and regulations. We might fail to establish and enforce procedures that comply with applicable legal requirements and regulations. We\nmight be adversely affected by new laws or regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or more rigorous\nenforcement. For instance, since we began to offer presidential election event contracts, the CFTC has been in the process of appealing the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia’s decision in KalshiEx LLC v.\n73\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and should the CFTC succeed on appeal, we may not be able to continue offering presidential election\nevent contracts and potentially could be subject to adverse litigation and regulatory actions for doing so. In addition, the CFTC has proposed a\nrule amendment that has not been finalized - if adopted by the CFTC, the election event contracts as offered would likely be prohibited. We also\nmight be adversely affected by other regulatory changes related to our obligations with regard to suitability of financial products, supervision,\nsales practices, application of fiduciary or best interest standards (including the interpretation of what constitutes an “investment\nrecommendation” for the purposes of the SEC’s “Regulation Best Interest” and state securities laws) and best execution in the context of our\nbusiness and market structure, any of which could limit our business, increase our costs and damage our reputation.\nBroker-Dealer Regulation\nAs broker-dealers, our subsidiaries RHF and RHS are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulators and SROs, and are\nsubject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities industry. Federal and state regulators and SROs, including the SEC and\nFINRA, can among other things investigate, censure or fine us, issue cease-and-desist orders or otherwise restrict our operations, require\nchanges to our business practices, products or services, limit our acquisition activities or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers\nor employees. Similarly, state attorneys general and other state regulators, including state securities and financial services regulators, can bring\nlegal actions on behalf of the citizens of their states to assure compliance with state laws. In addition, criminal authorities such as state attorneys\ngeneral or the DOJ may institute civil or criminal proceedings against us for violating applicable laws, rules, or regulations.\nMoney-Transmitter Regulation\nAs money transmitters, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the state level. We are also subject to regulation by\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). We have obtained or are in the process of obtaining licenses to operate as a money\ntransmitter (or as another type of regulated financial services institution, as applicable) in the United States and in the states where this is\nrequired. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the movement of customer funds,\nreporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies concerning those aspects of our business considered\nmoney transmission. Evaluation of our compliance efforts, as well as the questions of whether and to what extent our products and services are\nconsidered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. There are substantial costs and potential\nproduct and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing these licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to\nfines, other enforcement actions, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any such licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdictions. In certain\nmarkets, we might rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local\ncurrency, and local regulators might use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. The need to\nobtain or maintain these licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs, delay or preclude\nplanned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or\nadditional requirements on our business, products, and services, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.\nWe have been subject to regulatory investigations, actions, and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such\nproceedings in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nmaterially adverse manner.\nFrom time to time, we have been and currently are subject, and, given the highly regulated nature of the industries in which we operate, we\nexpect that we will be subject in the future, to a number of legal and regulatory examinations and investigations arising out of our business\npractices and operations,\n74\nTable of Contents\nconducted by the DOJ, SEC, FINRA, the CFTC and The National Futures Association or other federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”), the FDIC or CFPB, and state regulatory agencies, such as the MSD, the California\nAttorney General’s Office, and the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), among other authorities. These examinations and\ninvestigations have in some instances in the past and might in the future lead to lawsuits, arbitration claims, and enforcement proceedings, as\nwell as other actions and claims, that result in injunctions, fines, penalties, and monetary settlements. For example:\n• In June 2021, we resolved multiple matters with FINRA (including investigations into systems outages, our options product offering, and\nmargin-related communications with customers), resulting in censure, fines and restitution of $70 million, and engagement of an\nindependent consultant.\n• In connection with the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions, we and our employees, including our Co-founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, have\nreceived requests for information, and in some cases, subpoenas and requests for testimony from the USAO, the DOJ, Antitrust\nDivision, the SEC Staff, FINRA, the New York Attorney General’s Office, other state attorneys general offices, and a number of state\nsecurities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev’s cell phone. We have also received\ninquiries from the SEC’s Division of Examinations and Division of Enforcement and FINRA related to employee trading during the week\nof January 25, 2021 in some of the securities that were subject to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions, including GameStop Corp. and\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and specifically as to whether any employee trading in these securities may have occurred after the\ndecision to impose the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions and before the public announcement of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions on\nJanuary 28, 2021. We are cooperating with these investigations and examinations.\n• In August 2022, we settled an NYDFS investigation under which we paid a monetary penalty of $30 million and engaged an independent\ncompliance consultant.\n• Since March 2023, we have reached settlements with over 45 state regulators, including, for example, the Alabama Securities\nCommission, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Colorado Division of Securities, the Delaware\nDepartment of Justice - Investor Protection Unit, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, the South Dakota Division of Insurance, and the\nTexas State Securities Board regarding investigations related to RHF’s options trading and related customer communications and\ndisplays, options and margin trading approval process, the March 2020 Outages, and customer support issues prior to June 2020, under\nwhich we have agreed to pay a monetary penalty of $200,000 per state. Potential additional state settlements as part of a multi-state\nsettlement related to these issues totaling up to approximately $10 million are possible.\n• In January 2024, we settled a matter with the MSD related to supervision of certain product features and marketing strategies, the March\n2020 Outages, and our options trading approval process, as well as the November 2021 Data Security Incident, under which we paid a\n$7.5 million fine and engaged an independent consultant to review, among other things, implementation of the FINRA independent’s\nrecommendations, policies and procedures regarding certain application features, and cybersecurity measures.\n• In August 2024, we settled a matter with the California Attorney General’s Office related to among other things, certain disclosures by\nRHC and delivery of customers’ cryptocurrency assets under California Corporations Code Sections 29520 and 29505 during the period\nJanuary 2018 through April 2022. We paid a monetary penalty of $3.9 million.\nThese and other proceedings, some of which are described in Note 14 - Commitments & Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report,\n75\nTable of Contents\nhave in the past and might in the future relate to broker-dealer and financial services rules and regulations, including our trading and supervisory\npolicies and procedures, our clearing practices, our trade reporting, our public communications, our compliance with FINRA registration\nrequirements, anti-money laundering and other financial crimes regulations, cybersecurity matters, a particular cryptocurrency’s status as a\n“security,” and our business continuity plans, among other topics. These sorts of proceedings, inquiries, examinations, investigations, and other\nregulatory matters might subject us to fines, penalties, and monetary settlements, harm our reputation and brand, require substantial\nmanagement attention, result in additional compliance requirements, result in certain of our subsidiaries losing their regulatory licenses or ability\nto conduct business in some jurisdictions (which could, among other things, result in statutory disqualification by FINRA and the SEC), increase\nregulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations or require us to change our business practices, require changes to our products and\nservices, require changes in personnel or management, delay planned product or service launches or development, limit our ability to acquire\nother complementary businesses and technologies, or lead to the suspension or expulsion of our broker-dealer or other regulated subsidiaries or\ntheir officers or employees.\nIn connection with litigation settlements, we have in the past and might in the future be required to make expenditures to enhance our\ncompliance activities. For example, in connection with the August 2022 NYDFS settlement, we engaged an independent consultant to perform a\ncomprehensive evaluation of our compliance program and remediation efforts with respect to identified deficiencies and violations. The\nindependent consultant’s evaluation is still ongoing, and resulted in a recommendation to implement enhancements in certain areas identified in\nthe settlement, which require significant effort to implement.\nAdditionally, while we now offer select services and products in certain countries outside the United States, we are not currently licensed,\nauthorized, or registered in every jurisdiction (and in some cases are not licensed in every state). Under the terms of our customer agreements,\nwe currently offer services only to citizens and permanent residents with a legal address within those jurisdictions where we are authorized and\nregistered, and our application includes features designed to block access to our services from unauthorized jurisdictions. However, to the extent\na customer accesses our application or services outside of jurisdictions where we have obtained required governmental licenses and\nauthorization, we face a risk of becoming subject to regulations in that local jurisdiction. A regulator’s investigation as to whether or conclusion\nthat we are servicing customers in its jurisdiction without being appropriately licensed, registered, or authorized could result in fines or other\nenforcement actions or settlements.\nRecent statements by lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have signaled an increased focus on new or additional\nregulations that could impact our business and require us to make significant changes to our business model and practices.\nVarious lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have recently made statements about our business and that of other broker-dealers\nand signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that, if acted upon, could impact our business. Over three days in the\nspring of 2021, the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on the January 2021 market volatility\nand disruptions surrounding GameStop and other “meme” stocks at which various members of Congress expressed concerns about various\nmarket practices, including PFOF and options trading. In his testimony, Chair Gensler indicated that he had instructed the SEC Staff to study,\nand in some cases make rulemaking recommendations to the SEC regarding, a variety of market issues and practices, including PFOF, digital\nengagement practices, and whether broker-dealers are adequately disclosing their policies and procedures around potential trading restrictions;\nwhether margin requirements and other payment requirements are sufficient; and whether broker-dealers have appropriate tools to manage their\nliquidity and risk. Chair Gensler also discussed the use of mobile app features such as rewards, bonuses, push notifications and other prompts.\nChair Gensler suggested that such prompts could promote behavior that is not in the interest of the customer, such as excessive trading. Chair\nGensler also advised that he had directed the SEC Staff to consider whether expanded\n76\nTable of Contents\nenforcement mechanisms are necessary. In December 2022, the SEC proposed the December 2022 Rule Proposals, which relate to (i) best\nexecution, (ii) order competition, (iii) order execution disclosure, and (iv) order tick size and fee caps. In September 2024, the SEC adopted\nequity market structure rules related to (i) order execution disclosure and (ii) order tick size and fee caps. The SEC issued a request for\ninformation and public comment on digital engagement practices by broker-dealers and investment advisers in August 2021. In his April 2023\ntestimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Chair Gensler stated that he had asked the SEC Staff to\nmake recommendations for rule proposals addressing conflicts that can arise from the use of predictive analytics, in particular conflicts that may\narise to the extent advisors or brokers are optimizing their own interests as well as others. On July 26, 2023, the SEC proposed new rules (the\n“July 2023 Rule Proposals”) that would impose new obligations on registered broker-dealers and investment advisers with respect to their use of\ncertain covered technologies when interacting with investors. In May 2024, Chair Gensler indicated in multiple speeches that the SEC Staff was\nconsidering re-proposing modified versions of these rules and the SEC’s Spring 2024 regulatory flexibility agenda published in July 2024\nindicates that a second notice of proposed rulemaking on this topic is scheduled for October 2024. However, if adopted as originally proposed,\nthe July 2023 Rule Proposals may require us to modify, limit or discontinue our use of certain technologies and product features—and could\nsignificantly change the way that we interact with existing and prospective customers—which may adversely impact our business and revenues.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we have received requests from regulators, including from the SEC, regarding our collection and uses of\ncustomer data and related disclosures.\nIn addition, in 2022, FINRA issued a regulatory notice requesting comment on complex products and options including “whether the current\nregulatory framework…is appropriately tailored to address current concerns raised by complex products and options.” If FINRA amends its rules\nto impose additional requirements on firms with respect to determining customer eligibility and/or suitability to trade options, such rule changes\ncould result in fewer Robinhood customers being approved to trade options which could negatively impact our options trading volumes and\nassociated revenues.\nAlso, in September 2021, FINRA announced that it is reviewing firms’ use of social media marketing, including social media influencers,\nwhich is a marketing channel that we actively utilize. In February 2022, FINRA opened an investigation into our use of social media marketing. In\nFebruary 2023, FINRA provided updated guidance about firms’ practices related to their acquisition of customers through social media channels,\nas well as firms' sharing of customers’ usage information with affiliates and non-affiliated third parties. In light of this updated guidance, we\nnarrowed the scope of our social media influencer and affiliate publisher programs. Any additional limits that FINRA might impose on our use of\nthis marketing channel could make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, resulting in slower growth.\nTo the extent that the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory authorities or legislative bodies adopt additional regulations or legislation in respect of\nany of these areas or relating to any other aspect of our business, we could face a heightened risk of potential regulatory violations and could be\nrequired to make significant changes to our business model and practices, which changes might not be successful. Any of these outcomes could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could expose us to\nsignificant liability and reputational harm.\nIn addition to regulatory proceedings, we are also involved in numerous other litigation matters, including putative class action lawsuits, and\nwe anticipate that we will continue to be a target for litigation in the future. Potential litigation matters include commercial litigation matters,\ninsurance matters, securities litigation matters, privacy and cybersecurity disputes, intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, consumer\nprotection matters, and employment matters. This risk might be more pronounced\n77\nTable of Contents\nduring market downturns, during which the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings\nagainst financial services companies have historically increased.\nLitigation matters brought against us have in the past and might in the future require substantial management attention and might result in\nsettlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties, and other adverse results. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, penalty, or injunctive relief\ncould be material to our results of operations or cash flows for a particular period, or could cause us significant reputational harm.\nFor more information about the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, see Note 14 - Commitments & Contingencies, to our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report.\nWe are subject to governmental laws and requirements regarding anti-corruption, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, anti-\nmoney laundering, and counter-terror financing that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to\ncriminal or civil liability if we violate them.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC and we have processes in place to facilitate\ncompliance with the OFAC regulations. As part of our customer onboarding process, in accordance with the Customer Identification Program\nrules under Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act, we screen all potential customers against OFAC watchlists and continue to screen all customers,\nvendors and employees daily against OFAC watchlists. Although our application includes features designed to block access to our services from\nsanctioned countries, if our services are accessed from a sanctioned country in violation of trade and economic sanctions, we could be subject\nto enforcement actions.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, U.S. and foreign bribery laws, and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nlaws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their\nthird-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public\nsector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to\nprevent any such actions. The failure to comply with any such laws could subject us to criminal or civil liability, cause us significant reputational\nharm, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things,\nour involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In the United States, most of our services are subject to anti-money laundering\nlaws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, and similar laws and regulations. Regulators in the United States continue to\nincrease their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations. For example, in August 2022, we settled an NYDFS investigation of our\ncryptocurrency business related primarily to anti-money laundering and cybersecurity-related issues, under which we paid a monetary penalty of\n$30 million and engaged an independent compliance consultant.\nAlthough our operations are currently concentrated in the United States, we recently started expanding our operations outside of the United\nStates. As we have started to expand internationally, we have become subject to additional non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, and other\nrequirements regarding economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terror financing. In order to comply with applicable\nlaws, we have started to, and will continue to, revise and expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity\nof our customers and to monitor transactions on our system, including payments to persons outside of the United States. The need to comply\nwith multiple sets of laws, rules, regulations, and other requirements could substantially increase our compliance costs, impair our ability to\ncompete in international markets, and subject us to risk of criminal or civil liability for violations.\n78\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Attracting, Retaining, and Engaging Customers\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may have products\nand services that are more appealing than ours to our current or potential customers.\nThe markets in which we compete are evolving and highly competitive, with multiple participants competing for the same customers. Our\ncurrent and potential future competition principally comes from incumbent brokerages, established financial technology companies, venture-\nbacked financial technology firms, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, asset management firms, financial institutions, and technology platforms.\nThe majority of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater capital resources than we have and offer a wider range of products\nand services. Some of our competitors, particularly new and emerging technology companies, are not subject to the same regulatory\nrequirements or scrutiny to which we are subject, which could allow them to innovate more quickly or take more risks, placing us at a competitive\ndisadvantage. The impact of competitors with superior name recognition, greater market acceptance, larger customer bases, or stronger capital\npositions could adversely affect our results of operations and customer acquisition and retention. Our competitors might also be able to respond\nmore quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can, especially larger\ncompetitors that might benefit from more diversified product and customer bases. For example, some of our competitors have quickly adopted,\nor are seeking to adopt, some of our key offerings and services, including commission-free trading, fractional share trading, no account\nminimums, and IRA match since their introduction on our platforms in order to compete with us. In addition, competitors might conduct extensive\npromotional activities, offer better terms or offer differentiating products and services that could attract our current and prospective customers\nand potentially result in intensified competition within our markets. We continue to experience aggressive price competition in our markets and\nwe might not be able to match the marketing efforts or prices of our competitors. In addition, our competitors might choose to forgo PFOF, which\ncould create downward pressure on PFOF and make it more difficult for us to maintain our PFOF arrangements, which are a significant source\nof our revenue. We might also be subject to increased competition as our competitors enter into business combinations or partnerships, or\nestablished companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the financial services and cryptocurrency markets depends on a number of factors, including, among\nother things:\n• maintaining competitive pricing;\n• providing easy-to-use, innovative, and attractive products and services that are adopted by customers;\n• retaining customers (such as by providing effective customer support and avoiding outages, security breaches, and trading restrictions);\n• recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel and senior management;\n• maintaining and improving our reputation and the market perception of our brand and overall value;\n• maintaining our relationships with our counterparties; and\n• adjusting to a dynamic regulatory environment.\nOur competitive position within our markets could be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately address these factors.\n79\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, or if our customers decrease their use of our products and services,\nour revenue will decline.\nWe have experienced customer growth in recent years (and significant growth in 2020 and 2021 in particular), including a significant fraction\nof new customers, often more than 50%, who have told us that Robinhood is their first brokerage account. Our business and revenue growth\ndepends on our efforts to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and increase the amount that our customers use our products and\nservices (including premium services, such as Robinhood Gold). It is particularly important that we retain and engage our most active brokerage\ncustomers, who account for a disproportionately large percentage of our brokerage trading volumes. Any erosion of this active customer base\nwould have a disproportionately large negative impact on our revenues, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\ndecline significantly. We have historically relied significantly on our customers joining organically or through the Robinhood Referral Program,\nwhich accounted for over 80% of the customers that joined our platforms in each of 2020, 2021, and 2022, and since 2023 we have started to\nincrease our investment in paid marketing channels. Our efforts to attract and retain customers might fail due to a number of factors, including\nour customers losing confidence in us or preferring a competitor’s offerings. Additional factors that could lead to a decline in our number of\ncustomers or their usage of our products and services or that could prevent us from increasing our number of customers include:\n• a decline in our brand and reputation;\n• increased pricing for our products and services;\n• ineffective marketing efforts or a reduction in marketing activity;\n• certain of our customers, due to being new and inexperienced, might be less loyal to our product or less likely to maintain historical\ntrading patterns and interest in investing;\n• a broad decline in the equity or other financial markets, which could result in many of these investors feeling discouraged and exiting the\nmarkets altogether (such as the 2022 Bear Markets);\n• rising inflation resulting in less disposable income for our customers to invest;\n• our customers experiencing difficulties using the Robinhood app as intended, due to any number of reasons such as design errors,\nservice outages, or trading restrictions imposed by us;\n• our customers experiencing security or data breaches, account intrusions, or other unauthorized access;\n• our failure to provide adequate customer service;\n• customer resistance to and non-acceptance of cryptocurrencies; and\n• customer dissatisfaction with the limited number of cryptocurrencies available on our platforms or with our ceasing support for\ncryptocurrencies on our RHC platform that the SEC or a court has asserted or determined are securities or our proactively removing\ncertain cryptocurrencies from our RHC platform because they share similarities with such cryptocurrencies.\nOur customers may choose to cease using our platforms, products, and services at any time, and may choose to transfer their accounts to\nanother broker-dealer. For example, during the first quarter of 2021 many customers became upset by our imposition of the Early 2021 Trading\nRestrictions and we saw an increase in customers choosing to transfer their accounts to other broker-dealers. The total value of outbound\nACATS, an automated industry system for account asset transfers, was $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, involving 5.2% of AUC from\napproximately 206,000 accounts, as compared to outbound transfers of $0.5 billion, involving 1.2% of AUC from approximately 24,000 accounts\nduring each quarter of 2020 on average.\n80\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to provide and monetize new and innovative products and services that are adopted by customers, our business may\nbecome less competitive and our revenue might decline.\nOur ability to attract, engage, and retain our customers and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to evolve our existing\nproducts and services and to create and monetize new products and services that are adopted by customers. Rapid and significant technological\nchanges continue to confront the financial services industry, including developments in the methods in which securities are traded and\ndevelopments in cryptocurrencies. To keep pace or to innovate we have introduced and might continue to introduce significant changes to our\nexisting products and services or acquire or introduce new and unproven products and services, including using technologies with which we\nhave little or no prior development or operating experience (for instance, presidential election event contracts). Our efforts have been and might\ncontinue to be inhibited by industry-wide standards, legal restrictions, incompatible customer expectations, demands, and preferences, or third-\nparty intellectual property rights. Our efforts to innovate have been and might continue to also be delayed or blocked by new or enhanced\nregulatory scrutiny or technical complications. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services has required and might continue to\nrequire substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we might not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in\na timely manner or at all. It might be difficult to monetize products in a manner consistent with our brand’s focus on low prices. If we fail to\ninnovate and deliver products and services with market fit and differentiation, or fail to do so quickly enough as compared to our competitors, we\nmight fail to attract and retain customers and maintain customer engagement, causing our revenue to decline. Our international expansion\nefforts may increase these risks as we expect to adapt our product and service offerings to reflect local regulatory requirements, customer\npreferences, and other location-specific factors, as discussed in “—Risks Related to Our Business—We recently started operating in certain\ninternational markets and plan to further expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant new risks, and our international\nexpansion efforts might not succeed.”\nRisks Related to Our Platforms, Systems, and Technology\nOur products and services rely on software and systems that are highly technical and have been, and may in the future be, subject to\ninterruption, instability, and other potential flaws due to software errors, design defects, and other processing, operational, and\ntechnological failures, whether internal or external.\nWe rely on technology, including the internet and mobile services, to conduct much of our business activity and allow our customers to\nconduct financial transactions on our platforms. Our systems and operations, including our cloud-based operations and disaster recovery\noperations, as well as those of the third parties on which we rely to conduct certain key functions, are vulnerable to disruptions from natural\ndisasters, power and service outages, interruptions or losses, computer and telecommunications failures, software bugs, cybersecurity attacks,\ncomputer viruses, malware, distributed denial of service attacks, spam attacks, phishing or other social engineering, ransomware, security\nbreaches, credential stuffing, technological failure, human error, terrorism, improper operation, unauthorized entry, data loss, intentional bad\nactions, and other similar events and we have experienced such disruptions in the past. Further, we have in the past and might in the future be\nparticularly vulnerable to any such internal technology failures because we rely heavily on our own self-clearing platform, proprietary order\nrouting system, data platforms, and other back-end infrastructure for our operations, and any such failures could have an adverse effect on our\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the Q4 2022 Processing Error, allowed customers, for a limited\ntime, to execute trades selling more shares than they held in their accounts. This caused a temporary short position in that ticker symbol which\nRobinhood covered out of corporate cash within the same trading day, resulting in a loss of $57 million.\nOur products and internal systems also rely on software that is highly technical and complex (including software developed or maintained\ninternally and/or by third parties and also including machine\n81\nTable of Contents\nlearning models) in order to collect, store, retrieve, transmit, manage and otherwise process immense amounts of data. The software on which\nwe rely might contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations that might compromise our ability to meet our\nobjectives. Some such problems are inherently difficult to detect and some such problems might only be discovered after code has been\nreleased for external or internal use. Media outlets have in the past and might in the future learn of our plans for features by examining hidden\nbut unprotected images and code in publicly available beta versions of our app, resulting in unwanted publicity prior to our intended\nannouncement dates. For example, this occurred in September 2021 prior to our launch announcement for our crypto transfers feature (“Crypto\nTransfers”). Such problems might also lead to negative customer experiences (including the communication of inaccurate information to\ncustomers), compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with customer expectations, delayed product introductions,\ncompromised ability to protect data and intellectual property, or an inability to provide some or all of our services.\nWhile we have made, and continue to make, significant investments designed to correct software errors and design defects and to enhance\nthe reliability and scalability of our platforms and operations, the risk of software and system failures and design defects is always present, we do\nnot have fully redundant systems, and we might fail to maintain, expand, and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet future\nrequirements and mitigate future risks on a timely basis. It might become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our\nplatforms, especially as our platforms and product offerings become more complex and our customer base grows. For instance, we have needed\nand will continue to need to have adequate capacity and infrastructure on our platform with respect to the rollout, offering, and settlement of\npresidential election event contracts. We might also encounter technical issues in connection with changes and upgrades to the underlying\nnetworks of supported cryptocurrencies. Any number of technical changes, software upgrades, soft or hard forks, cybersecurity incidents, or\nother changes to the underlying blockchain networks might occur from time to time, causing incompatibility, technical issues, disruptions or\nsecurity weaknesses to our platforms. If we are unable to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve any such issues successfully, we might no longer be\nable to support such cryptocurrency, our customers’ assets might be frozen or lost, the security of our hot or cold wallets might be compromised,\nand our platforms and technical infrastructure might be affected.\nIn addition, surges in trading volume on our platforms have in the past and might in the future cause our systems to operate at diminished\nspeed or even fail, temporarily or for a more prolonged period of time, which would affect our ability to process transactions and potentially result\nin some customers’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate, executed incorrectly, or not executed at all. For example, we\nexperienced (i) the March 2020 Outages, which resulted in some of our customers being unable to buy and sell securities and other financial\nproducts on our U.S. trading platform for a period of time, and (ii) the April-May 2021 Disruptions, which resulted in some of our customers being\nunable to buy and sell cryptocurrencies for a period of time. Our platforms have otherwise in the past and might in the future experience outages.\nThe March 2020 Outages resulted in putative class action lawsuits, arbitrations, and regulatory examinations and investigations. We provided\nremediation to many of our customers impacted by the March 2020 Outages through cash payments, resulting in out-of-pocket losses to us of\napproximately $3.6 million. Disruptions to, destruction of, improper access to, breach of, instability of, or failure to effectively maintain our\ninformation technology systems (including our data processing systems, self-clearing platform, and order routing system) that allow our\ncustomers to use our products and services, and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our\nreputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue, regulatory or governmental investigations, civil litigation, and liability for damages. In addition, our\ncustomer service team from time to time experiences backlogs responding to customer support requests. These backlogs have compounded\nwhen we have experienced any market outages, provider network disruptions, or platform outages or errors, including, for example, in\nconnection with the March 2020 Outages and the April-May 2021 Disruptions, and may compound in the future as a result of such events.\nFrequent or persistent interruptions, or perceptions of such interruptions whether true or not, in our products and services could cause customers\nto believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to otherwise avoid our products and\nservices. Additionally, our insurance policies might be insufficient to cover a claim made against us by any such customers affected by any\ndisruptions, outages, or other performance or infrastructure problems.\n82\nTable of Contents\nOur success depends in part upon continued distribution through app stores and effective operation with mobile operating systems,\nnetworks, technologies, products, hardware and standards that we do not control.\nA substantial majority of our customers’ activity on our platforms occurs on mobile devices. We are dependent on the interoperability of our\napp with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, hardware, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems. Any changes, bugs or technical issues in such systems, new generations of mobile devices or new versions\nof operating systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system providers, device manufacturers or mobile carriers, or in their\nterms of service or policies that degrade the functionality of our app, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute applications, give preferential\ntreatment to competitive products, limit our ability to target or measure the effectiveness of applications, or impose fees or other charges related\nto our delivery of our application could adversely affect customer usage of the Robinhood app. For example, from time to time we have\nexperienced delays in our ability to launch products or update features on our platforms as a result of prolonged app store review processes.\nFurther, we are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of these operating systems, as well as policies and terms of service of the\nvarious application stores that make our application and experiences available to our developers, creators and customers. These policies and\nterms of service govern the availability, promotion, distribution, content and operation generally of applications and experiences on such\noperating systems and stores. Each provider of these operating systems and stores has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of\nservice and policies with respect to our platforms and those changes might be unfavorable to us and our customers’ use of our platforms. If we\nwere to violate, or an operating system provider or application store believes that we have violated, its terms of service or policies, that operating\nsystem provider or application store could limit or discontinue our access to its operating system or store. Any limitation or discontinuation of our\naccess to any third-party platform or application store could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in order to deliver a high-quality mobile experience for our customers, it is important that our products and services work well\nwith a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, hardware and standards that we do not control. We need to continuously\nmodify, enhance, and improve our products and services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, mobile operating systems and\nother software, communication, browser, and database technologies. We might not be successful in developing products that operate effectively\nwith these technologies, products, systems, networks or standards or in bringing them to market quickly or cost-effectively in response to market\ndemands. If our customers choose to not update our app to the latest version, or if it is otherwise difficult for them to access or use our app on\ntheir mobile devices, or if they use mobile products that do not offer access to our app, our customer growth and engagement could be adversely\naffected and our revenues might decline. In addition, if our customers use older versions of our app it may result in customer complaints and\nregulatory inquiries that could lead to arbitration claims or regulatory sanctions.\nWe rely on third parties to perform some key functions, and their failure to perform those functions could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including several cloud technology providers such as\nAmazon Web Services (on which we primarily rely to deliver our services to customers on our platforms), internet service providers, payment\nservices providers, market and third-party data providers, regulatory services providers, clearing systems, market makers, alternative trading\nsystems (such as Blue Oceans ATS, LLC (“BOATS”) with respect to Robinhood 24 Hour Market), exchange systems, (such as ForecastEx, LLC,\nwith respect to presidential election event contracts), banking systems, payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing\nnetworks to process transactions, co-location facilities, communications facilities, and other third-party facilities to run our platforms, facilitate\ntrades by our customers, provide the technology we use to manage some of our cryptocurrency custody, transfer, and settlement operations,\nand support or carry out some regulatory obligations. In addition, external content providers provide us with financial information, market news,\n83\nTable of Contents\ncharts, option and stock quotes, cryptocurrency quotes, research reports, and other fundamental data that we provide to our customers. These\nproviders are susceptible to processing, operational, technological and security vulnerabilities, including security breaches, which might impact\nour business, and our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is limited. In addition, these third-party service providers\nmight rely on subcontractors to provide services to us that face similar risks.\nWe face a risk that our third-party service providers might be unable or unwilling to continue to provide these services to meet our current\nneeds in an efficient, cost-effective manner or to expand their services to meet our needs in the future. Any failures by our third-party service\nproviders that result in an interruption in service, unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data or other similar occurrences could\ninterrupt our business, cause us to incur losses, result in decreased customer satisfaction and increase customer attrition, subject us to\ncustomer complaints, significant fines, litigation, disputes, claims, regulatory investigations or other inquiries and harm our reputation. Regulators\nmight also hold us responsible for the failures of our providers. For example, after BOATS, the trading venue that primarily supports overnight\ntrading on Robinhood 24 Hour Market (8:00 pm - 4:00 am ET), experienced disruptions during the overnight trading session on August 4- 5,\n2024, we received requests for information from certain regulators.\nWe are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and processes. These technologies may present business,\ncompliance, and reputational risks.\nWe currently use machine learning and AI to improve our products and processes in certain circumstances, such as to increase the\nefficiency of our in-app chat support, fraud detection systems, and software coding optimization, as well as via our acquisition of Pluto Capital,\nan AI powered investment research platform, and have plans to continue to expand our use of AI in the future. Our research and development of\nsuch technology also remains ongoing. As with many new and emerging technologies, AI presents numerous risks and challenges that could\nadversely affect our business. If we fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technological developments, especially in the financial technology\nsector, our competitive position and business results may suffer. At the same time, use of AI has recently become the source of significant media\nattention and political debate. The introduction and use of AI technologies, particularly generative AI, into new or existing offerings may result in\nnew or expanded risks and liabilities, including due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical\nconcerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. For\nexample, AI technologies can lead to unintended consequences, including generating content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate,\nmisleading or otherwise flawed, or that results in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, which could negatively impact our customers,\nharm our reputation and business, and expose us to liability. Laws, regulations or industry standards that develop in response to the use of AI\nmay be burdensome or may restrict our ability to use, develop, or deploy AI, particularly generative AI technologies, in our products or\nprocesses, or our efforts to expand our business. For example, EU’s AI Act, which became effective on August 1, 2024, governs the\ndevelopment, marketing and use of AI in the EU and could impose significant additional costs on us to comply or significant fines for failing to\ncomply.\nWe also use AI technologies from third parties, which may include open source software. If we are unable to maintain rights to use these AI\ntechnologies on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate AI technologies, which may limit or delay our\nability to provide competitive offerings and may increase our costs. These AI technologies also may incorporate data from third-party sources,\nwhich may expose us to risks associated with data rights and protection. The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is\nrapidly evolving and uncertain, including with respect to intellectual property ownership and license rights, cybersecurity, and data protection\nlaws, among others, and has not been yet fully addressed by courts or regulators. The use, development, or adoption of AI technologies into our\nproducts may result in exposure to claims by third parties of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation, which may\nrequire us to pay compensation or license fees to third parties. The evolving legal, regulatory and compliance framework for AI technologies may\nalso impact our ability to protect our own data and intellectual property against infringing use.\n84\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a cybersecurity breach or other attack involving our computer systems or\ndata or those of our customers or third-party or fourth-party service providers.\nOur systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers have been and might in the future be vulnerable to cybersecurity\nissues. We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cybersecurity threats and our technologies, systems, and\nnetworks have been and might in the future be subject to attempted cybersecurity attacks. Such issues are increasing in frequency and evolving\nin nature, including employee and contractor theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported\nactors engaging in attacks. The operation of our platforms involves the use, collection, storage, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and other\nprocessing of customer information, including personal data. Security breaches and other security incidents could expose us to a risk of loss or\nexposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, investigations, regulatory fines, penalties for violation of applicable laws or\nregulations, litigation, and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm. As the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the\nsoftware and platforms we develop continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cybersecurity attacks increases.\nCybersecurity attacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase and financial technology platform providers have been\nand expect to continue to be targeted. In light of media attention, we might be a particularly attractive target of attacks seeking to access\ncustomer data or assets. For example, from January 1, 2020 to October 16, 2020, approximately 2,000 Robinhood customer accounts were\nallegedly accessed by unauthorized users. We believe these incidents resulted from compromised passwords off of our platforms, rather than\nany failure of our security or systems. Nonetheless, we experienced negative publicity in connection with these events and might in the future\nexperience similar adverse effects relating to real or perceived security incidents, whether or not related to the security of our platforms or\nsystems. We have also received customer complaints and been subject to litigation and regulatory inquiries, examinations, enforcement actions,\nand investigations by various state and federal regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA, and certain state regulators, including the NYDFS\nand the New York Attorney General, related to these events. The increasing sophistication and resources of cyber criminals and other non-state\nthreat actors and increased actions by nation-state actors make it difficult to keep up with new threats and could result in a breach of security.\nAdditionally, there is an increased risk that we might experience cybersecurity-related incidents as a result of any of our employees, service\nproviders, or other third-parties working remotely on less secure systems and environments. While we take significant efforts to protect our\nsystems and data, including establishing internal processes and implementing technological measures designed to provide multiple layers of\nsecurity, our safety and security measures might be insufficient to prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our information systems, data\n(including personal data), and operations. For example, we experienced the November 2021 Data Security Incident. Based on our investigation\nand that of a third-party security firm, we believe that the unauthorized party obtained names or email addresses for millions of people, phone\nnumbers for several thousand people, additional personal information for a few hundred people, and extensive account details for about ten\npeople, though we believe no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or credit or debit card numbers were exposed and that there has\nbeen no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident.\nFurthermore, to the extent the operation of our systems relies on our third-party service providers, through either a connection to, or an\nintegration with, third parties’ systems, the risk of cybersecurity attacks and loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to or publication of our\ninformation or the confidential information and personal data of customers and employees might increase. Third-party risks might include\ninsufficient security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security\nmeasures might be inadequate. Our ability to monitor, and our resources to optimize integration with, third-party service providers’ data security\npractices are also limited. These third-party risks might be exacerbated as our resources are spread across multiple public cloud service\nproviders. Although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our third-party service providers, such\nagreements might not prevent the accidental\n85\nTable of Contents\nor unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of, or modification of data (including\npersonal data) and/or might not enable us to obtain adequate (or any) reimbursement from our third-party service providers in the event we\nshould suffer any such incidents. For example, the massive, nearly two-year long, cybersecurity attack against SolarWinds Corp., known as the\nSUNBURST attack, highlights the growing risk from cybersecurity threats against trusted third-party software which can lead to thousands of\ncustomers’ data being compromised. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we could be held responsible for any\ninformation security failure or cybersecurity attack attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them. A vulnerability in\na third-party service provider’s software or systems, a failure of our third-party service providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures, or a breach\nof a third-party service provider’s software or systems could result in the compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our systems\nor the data housed in our third-party solutions. Additionally, we could also be exposed to information security vulnerabilities or failures at third\nparties’ common suppliers or vendors (known as “fourth parties”) that could also impact the security of our data, and we may not be able to\neffectively directly monitor or mitigate such fourth-party risks, in particular as such risks relate to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the\nthird parties that perform functions and services for us and our limited ability to assess the fourth party’s operational controls.\nFor example, in January 2023, unauthorized posts were made on our social media accounts, which were all removed within minutes. Based\non a preliminary investigation, we believe the source of the incident was a compromise at a third-party vendor. In addition, in March 2022 a\nsecurity breach occurred at Okta, an identity authentication provider that we utilize across our employee base. In general, an attacker with forged\nor compromised Okta service provider credentials could potentially have accessed several of our sensitive internal systems. Okta reports it has\nnow corrected the issue and working with Okta, we have confirmed that such third-party vulnerability was not exploited to gain access to our\nsystems.\nA core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our platforms. Any unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction,\ndisablement or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of data, including personal data, cybersecurity breach or other security incident\nthat we, our customers or our third-party or fourth-party service providers experience or the perception that one has occurred or might occur,\ncould harm our reputation, reduce the demand for our products and services and disrupt normal business operations. In addition, it might require\nus to expend significant financial and operational resources in response to a security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing\nsecurity protection costs by deploying additional personnel and modifying or enhancing our protection technologies, investigating, remediating,\nor correcting the breach and any security vulnerabilities, defending against and resolving legal and regulatory claims, and preventing future\nsecurity breaches and incidents, all of which could expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, expose us to legal\nliabilities, including litigation, regulatory enforcement, indemnity obligations, or damages for contract breach, divert resources and the attention of\nour management and key personnel away from our business operations, and cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, our efforts to improve security and protect data from\ncompromise might identify previously undiscovered security breaches. There could be public announcements regarding any security incidents\nand any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be\nnegative, it could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe are subject to stringent laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy\nand security and might become subject to additional related laws and regulations in jurisdictions into which we expand. Many of these\nlaws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices,\nmonetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or other harm to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and non-U.S. laws, directives, rules, policies, industry standards and regulations, as well\nas contractual obligations, relating to privacy and the\n86\nTable of Contents\ncollection, protection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data and other data, including the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act of 1999, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act and state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which\nprovides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected, know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to\nwhom and opt out of the sale of their personal data, among other rights. We also face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks in\nconnection with our expansion into the U.K. and the EU and other jurisdictions in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation, the\nePrivacy Directive (including its national implementations), and other data protection regulations. The regulatory framework for data privacy and\nsecurity worldwide is continuously evolving and developing and, as a result, interpretation and implementation standards and enforcement\npractices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. New laws, amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws, regulations,\nstandards and other obligations might require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations, and might require us to change\nhow we use, collect, store, transfer or otherwise process certain types of personal data, to implement new processes to comply with those laws\nand our customers’ exercise of their rights thereunder, and could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes\nto our operations, or even prevent us from providing some offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we might operate\nin the future or incur potential liability in an effort to comply with certain legislation. There is a risk of enforcement actions in response to rules\nand regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection\nagencies. For instance, we have in the past (as discussed in Note 14 - Commitments & Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in this Quarterly Report) and may in the future be subject to investigations and examinations by the NYDFS regarding,\namong other things, our cybersecurity practices. In addition, if we fail to follow these security standards, even if no customer information is\ncompromised, we might incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs. Following the November 2021 Data Security Incident,\nwe have received requests for information from FINRA examination staff, the SEC Division of Enforcement, and other regulatory authorities\nregarding, among other things, the adequacy of our information security measures.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable\nfederal, state or similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, policies, certifications or orders relating to data privacy and security,\nor any compromise of security that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personal data or\nother customer data, could result in significant awards, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties or judgments, proceedings or litigation by\ngovernmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions and negative publicity and reputational harm,\none or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Brokerage Products and Services\nIf we do not maintain the net capital levels required by regulators, our broker-dealer business may be restricted and we may be fined\nor subject to other disciplinary or corrective actions.\nThe SEC, FINRA, and various state regulators have stringent rules or proposed rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of\nnet capital by securities broker-dealers. For example, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are each subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule,\nwhich specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers, and our\nclearing and carrying broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act, which requires broker-dealers to maintain\nliquidity reserves. Our failure to maintain the required net capital levels could result in immediate suspension of securities activities, suspension\nor expulsion by the SEC or FINRA, restrictions on our ability to expand our existing business or to commence new businesses, and could\nultimately lead to the liquidation of our broker-dealer entities and winding down of our broker-dealer business. If such net capital rules are\nchanged or expanded (for instance, the SEC has\n87\nTable of Contents\nproposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3 as discussed above), if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, or if we make changes in\nour business operations that increase our capital requirements, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. A large\noperating loss or charge against net capital could have adverse effects on our ability to maintain or expand our business.\nOur compliance and risk management policies and procedures as a regulated financial services company might not be fully effective\nin identifying or mitigating compliance and risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\nAs a financial services company, our business exposes us to a number of heightened risks. We have devoted significant resources to\ndevelop our compliance and risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so, but our efforts might be insufficient. Our\nlimited operating experience at our current scale, evolving business, and unpredictable periods of rapid growth make it difficult to predict all of\nthe risks and challenges we might encounter and therefore increase the risk that our policies and procedures for identifying, monitoring, and\nmanaging compliance risks might not be fully effective in mitigating our exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Further,\nsome controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations and errors in oversight, which could cause our compliance and other risk\nmanagement strategies to be ineffective. Other compliance and risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding\nmarkets, customers, catastrophe occurrences, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which might not always\nbe accurate, complete, up-to-date, or properly evaluated. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools might be held by or available to us in\norder to manage some exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits, and policy exclusions, as well as risk of\ncounterparty denial of coverage, default, or insolvency. Any failure to maintain effective compliance and other risk management strategies could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to heightened regulatory risk because our business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of\nareas and geographies, and such regulations are subject to revision, supplementation, or evolving interpretations and application, and it can be\ndifficult to predict how they might be applied to our business, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new\njurisdictions. For example, in December 2022, RHF and RHS received investigative requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement regarding\ntheir record keeping and preservation practices, including use of personal devices for brokerage communications.\nWe are subject to potential losses as a result of our clearing and execution activities.\nWe provide clearing and execution services for our securities brokerage business. Clearing and execution services include the confirmation,\nreceipt, settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions. Clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the\npossession or control of customer securities and other assets, the clearing of customer securities transactions and lending money to customers\non margin. Self-clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than introducing brokers that rely on\nothers to perform clearing functions. Errors in performing clearing functions, including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds\nand securities on behalf of customers, could lead to (i) civil penalties, as well as losses and liability as a result of related lawsuits brought by\ncustomers and others and any out-of-pocket costs associated with remediating customers for losses, and (ii) the risk of fines or other actions by\nregulators. For example, the Q4 2022 Processing Error resulted in a $57 million loss and we have received requests for information from FINRA\nstaff related to this matter.\nAll customers can place limit orders to buy whole shares of the most traded exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and individual stocks – 24\nhours a day, five days a week, through Robinhood 24 Hour Market. Offering U.S. stock trading overnight has heightened risks related to our\nclearing and execution activities as we do not have previous experience operating or staffing our systems for around-the-clock coverage and\nmay not be able to accurately anticipate the volume of trading activity that will occur outside of regular market hours. Overnight trading on\nRobinhood 24 Hour Market is primarily supported by BOATS,\n88\nTable of Contents\na trading venue that replicates the role that stock exchanges play during regular market hours. If BOATS becomes unwilling or unable to do\nbusiness with us or one of our market makers in the future, we may be unable to find another trading platform to support Robinhood 24 Hour\nMarket, which could negatively impact our transaction-based revenue and generate negative publicity. Additionally, any disruptions in the\nservices provided by BOATS, whether due to technical malfunctions, operational mishaps, or external factors such as regulatory changes or\nmarket volatility, have in the past, and may in the future impair our ability to execute our client's orders. Should BOATS experience downtime or\ndiminished performance (as it has in the past and could again in the future), particularly during overnight trading hours, our ability to execute\ncustomer orders through Robinhood 24 Hour Market could be compromised and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and/or brand and reputation. For example, on August 5, 2024, BOATS did not open for overnight trading and as\na result, Robinhood customers were unable to execute any trades during that overnight session.\nAdditionally, the SEC finalized rules in February 2023 to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions in\nsecurities from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one (T+1), which became effective on May 28, 2024. The shortening of the settlement\ncycle has led to a reduction in the length of exposure to trading counterparties and lower margin requirements for our clearing operations, but it\nhas also required technological, operational, and compliance adjustments across the industry that have been and are likely to continue to be\ntime consuming and costly for all market participants and which has increased and could continue to increase the risk of operational errors, any\nof which could be material in light of the magnitude and volume of our settlement-related activities and obligations.\nOur clearing operations also require a commitment of our capital and, despite safeguards implemented through both manual and automated\ncontrols, involve risks of losses due to the potential failure of our customers or counterparties to perform their obligations under these\ntransactions and margin loans. If our customers default on their obligations, including failing to pay for securities purchased, deliver securities\nsold, or meet margin calls, we remain financially liable for such obligations, and although these obligations are collateralized, we are subject to\nmarket risk in the liquidation of customer collateral to satisfy those obligations. While we have established systems and processes designed to\nmanage risks related to our clearing and execution services, we face a risk that such systems and processes might be inadequate. Any liability\narising from clearing and margin operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as a clearing member firm of securities and derivatives clearinghouses in the United States, we are also exposed to clearing\nmember credit risk. Securities and derivatives clearinghouses require member firms to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for\nmargin requirements and for clearing funds. If a clearing member defaults in its obligations to the clearinghouse in an amount larger than its own\nmargin and clearing fund deposits, the shortfall is absorbed pro rata from the deposits of the other clearing members. Many clearinghouses of\nwhich we are members also have the authority to assess their members for additional funds if the clearing fund is depleted. A large clearing\nmember default could result in a substantial cost to us if we are required to pay such assessments. Furthermore, in the event that a significant\namount of our customers’ open trades fail to settle, we might be exposed to potential loss of the capital we committed to meet our deposit\nrequirements.\nOur exposure to credit risk with customers, market makers, and other counterparties could result in losses.\nWe extend margin credit and leverage to customers, which are collateralized by customer securities. By permitting customers to purchase\nsecurities on margin, we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit, especially during periods of rapidly declining markets (including rapid\ndeclines in the trading price of individual securities) in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a customer’s\nindebtedness. We also lend and borrow securities in connection with our broker-dealer business. In accordance with regulatory guidelines, we\nhold cash as collateral when we lend securities, and likewise, we collateralize our borrowings of securities by depositing cash with lenders.\nSharp changes\n89\nTable of Contents\nin market values of substantial amounts of securities in a short period of time and the failure by parties to the lending or borrowing transactions\nto honor their commitments could result in substantial losses. Such changes could also adversely impact our capital because our clearing\noperations require a commitment of our capital and, despite safeguards implemented by our software, involve risks of losses due to the potential\nfailure of our customers to perform their obligations under these transactions and margin loans.\nWe are also exposed to credit risk in our dealings with the market makers to which we route cryptocurrency orders. Unlike equities and\noption trades, cryptocurrency trades do not settle through any central clearinghouses but rather are conducted under bilateral agreements\nbetween us and each crypto market maker. (The risk of the market maker's default therefore falls upon us rather than being distributed among a\nclearinghouse's members.) The terms of these bilateral agreements vary but spot transactions are generally aggregated and settled on a net\nbasis once per business day (with the crypto deliveries occurring first and the net cash moving within 24 hours thereafter) and payment\nobligations are generally unsecured during the interval between delivery and payment. It is not uncommon for us to have an intra-day\noutstanding net receivable of $100 million that we are owed by any one cryptocurrency market maker. Similarly, we routinely have unsecured\nPFOF receivables from equities and options market makers. Any payment default by a market maker could have adverse effects on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe have policies and procedures designed to manage credit risk, but we face a risk that such policies and procedures might not be fully\neffective.\nProviding investment recommendations could subject us to investigations, penalties, and liability for customer losses if we fail to\ncomply with applicable regulatory standards, and providing investment education tools could subject us to additional risks if such\ntools are construed to be investment advice or recommendations.\nRisks associated with providing investment recommendations include those arising from how we disclose and address possible conflicts of\ninterest, inadequate due diligence, inadequate disclosure, and human error. Regulations, such as the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest and certain\nstate broker-dealer regulations, impose heightened conduct standards and requirements on recommendations to retail investors. For example, in\nSeptember 2023, the North American Securities Association (“NASAA”) (an association of state securities administrators) proposed revisions to\nthe NASAA model rule regarding Dishonest or Unethical Business Practices of Broker-Dealers and Agents, which are intended to address\nRegulation Best Interest and other developments in the securities industry. In addition, various states are considering potential regulations or\nhave already adopted certain regulations that could impose additional standards of conduct or other obligations on us to the extent we provide\ninvestment advice or recommendations to our customers. The SEC’s July 2023 Rule Proposals, if adopted as originally proposed, would impose\nnew requirements with respect to our use of a wide range of covered technologies when we are engaging or communicating with existing and\nprospective customers. If adopted as originally proposed, the proposals may require us to modify, limit or discontinue our use of certain\ntechnologies and product features—and would introduce new regulatory considerations or requirements that would apply to our communications\nand interactions with existing and prospective customers, including to the extent we provide investment advice or recommendations to them.\nWe also provide customers with a variety of educational materials, investment tools, and financial news and information, such as our\n“Snacks” newsletter (which is offered by Sherwood Media), the suite of other editorial offerings that Sherwood Media has launched and will\ncontinue to launch, and the Robinhood Investment Index. Additionally, Robinhood Gold members have access to stock research reports\nprepared by our third-party collaborator, Morningstar, Inc. and Level II market data from Nasdaq. Based on current law and regulations, we\nbelieve these services do not constitute investment advice or investment recommendations. If the law were to change or if a court or regulator\nwere to interpret current law and regulations in a novel manner, we face a risk that these services could come to be considered as investment\nadvice.\n90\nTable of Contents\nIf services that we do not consider to be recommendations (such as educational materials, and our editorial offerings, including Snacks) are\nconstrued as constituting investment advice or recommendations, we have been and could be in the future subject to investigations by\nregulatory agencies. For example, in December 2020, the Enforcement Section of MSD filed a complaint against us alleging that a fiduciary\nconduct standard applies to us under Massachusetts securities law by claiming that certain of our product features and marketing strategies\namount to investment recommendations. See Note 14 - Commitments & Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements in this Quarterly Report for more information. Changes in law or changes in interpretations of existing law might also require us to\nmodify the nature of these services or discontinue them altogether, one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract\nand retain customers.\nTo the extent our investment education tools, news and information, or digital engagement practices are determined to constitute investment\nadvice or recommendations and to the extent those recommendations fail to satisfy regulatory requirements, or we fail to know our customers, or\nimproperly advise our customers, or if risks associated with advisory services otherwise materialize, we could be found liable for losses suffered\nby such customers, or could be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, and other actions such as business limitations, any of which could harm\nour reputation and business.\nRisks Related to Cryptocurrency Products and Services\nThe loss, destruction or unauthorized use or access of a private key required to access any of the cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf\nof customers could result in irreversible loss of such cryptocurrencies. If we are unable to access the private keys or if we experience\na hack or other data loss relating to the cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, our customers might be unable to trade\ntheir cryptocurrency, our reputation and business could be harmed, and we might be liable for losses in excess of our ability to pay.\nAs we expand our cryptocurrency product and service offerings, the risks associated with failing to safeguard and manage cryptocurrencies\nwe hold on behalf of our customers increase. Our success and the success of our offerings requires significant public confidence in our ability to\nproperly manage customers’ balances and handle large transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure by us to maintain the\nnecessary controls or to manage the cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of our customers and funds appropriately and in compliance with\napplicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, significant financial losses, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their\nuse of our services, and result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions.\nWe hold all settled cryptocurrencies in custody on behalf of customers in two types of wallets: (i) hot wallets, which are managed online, and\n(ii) cold wallets, which are managed entirely offline and require physical access controls. We do not utilize third-party custodians for settled\ncryptocurrencies, but we do utilize technology from a third-party provider to manage some of our cryptocurrency, custody, transfer, and\nsettlement operations. In general, the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrency coins on our platforms are held in cold storage, though some\ncoins are held in hot wallets to support day-to-day operations. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of\n2002. As part of this, we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. This includes the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and the asset related to user\ncryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation on our consolidated balance sheets in our audited financial statements which represents our obligation\nto safeguard crypto-assets held in our custody on behalf of our users. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our\nfinancial statements and related notes are audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Under blockchain\nprotocol, in order to access or transfer cryptocurrency stored in a wallet, we need to use a private key. We maintain backup copies of our private\nkeys in multiple separate locations and we have several layers of cybersecurity defense in place to protect our omnibus wallets. However, to the\nextent any private keys are lost, destroyed, unable to be accessed by us, or otherwise compromised and all of their backups are lost, we will be\nunable to access the assets held in the related hot or cold wallet. Further, we cannot provide\n91\nTable of Contents\nassurance that any or all of our wallets will not be hacked or compromised such that cryptocurrencies are sent to one or more private addresses\nthat we do not control, which could result in the loss of some or all of the cryptocurrencies that we hold in custody on behalf of customers. Any\nsuch losses could be significant, and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage for some or all of those losses. Cryptocurrencies and\nblockchain technologies have been, and might in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities. For example,\nin August 2021, hackers were able to momentarily take over the Bitcoin SV (“BSV”) network, allowing them to spend coins they did not have and\nprevent transactions from completing. Any loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, the hot wallets or cold wallets we use\nto store our customers’ cryptocurrencies could result in total loss of customers’ cryptocurrencies (because customers’ cryptocurrency balances\nand cryptocurrency investments are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”)) or adversely affect our\ncustomers’ ability to sell their assets, and could result in our being required to reimburse customers for some or all of their losses, subjecting us\nto significant financial losses. Because many insurance carriers do not provide insurance coverage for crypto-related risks, comprehensive\ncoverage for such events is not readily available on commercially reasonable terms. Our current coverage is limited and may not cover the\nextent of loss, nor the nature of such loss, in which case we may be liable for the full amount of losses suffered, which could be greater than all\nof our remaining assets. The total value of cryptocurrencies under our control on behalf of customers is significantly greater than the current total\nvalue of insurance coverage that would compensate us in the event of theft or other loss of such assets. Furthermore, the term of our current\ninsurance policy expires in the third quarter of 2024, with our option to renew annually or for the carrier to terminate coverage with advance\nwritten notice. Any loss of our insurance coverage would impede our ability to mitigate any losses our customers might suffer if we are unable to\naccess private keys. Additionally, any such security compromises or any business continuity issues affecting our cryptocurrency market makers\nmight affect the ability or willingness of our customers to trade or hold cryptocurrencies on our platforms, might result in litigation and regulatory\nenforcement actions, and could harm customer trust in us and our products generally.\nThe prices of most cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of various cryptocurrencies might cause\nuncertainty in the market and could negatively impact trading volumes of cryptocurrencies, and we may not effectively identify,\nprevent or mitigate cryptocurrency market risks, any of which would adversely affect the success of our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe prices of most cryptocurrencies are based in part on market adoption and future expectations, which might or might not be realized. As\na result, the prices of cryptocurrencies are highly speculative. The prices of cryptocurrencies have been subject to dramatic fluctuations\n(including as a result of the 2022 Bear Markets), which have impacted, and will continue to impact, our trading volumes and operating results\nand might adversely impact our growth strategy and business. Several factors could affect a cryptocurrency’s price, including, but not limited to:\n• Global cryptocurrency supply, including various alternative currencies which exist, and global cryptocurrency demand, which can be\ninfluenced by the growth or decline of retail merchants’ and commercial businesses’ acceptance of cryptocurrencies as payment for\ngoods and services, the security of online cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets that hold cryptocurrencies, the perception that\nthe use and holding of digital currencies is safe and secure, and regulatory restrictions on their use.\n• Changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying a blockchain network, such as a fork. Forks have\noccurred and are likely to occur again in the future and could result in a sustained decline in the market price of cryptocurrencies.\n• Changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in a blockchain network.\n• The maintenance and development of the software protocol of cryptocurrencies.\n92\nTable of Contents\n• Cryptocurrency exchanges’ deposit and withdrawal policies and practices, liquidity on such exchanges and interruptions in service from\nor failures of such exchanges. For example, in connection with the 2022 Crypto Bankruptcies, the prices of coins such as Bitcoin,\nEthereum, and Solana significantly decreased.\n• Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use and value of cryptocurrencies or regulatory or judicial assertions or determinations that\ncertain cryptocurrencies are securities.\n• Competition for and among various cryptocurrencies that exist and market preferences and expectations with respect to adoption of\nindividual currencies.\n• Actual or perceived manipulation of the markets for cryptocurrencies.\n• Actual or perceived connections between cryptocurrencies (and related activities such as mining) and adverse environmental effects or\nillegal activities.\n• Social media posts and other public communications by high-profile individuals relating to specific cryptocurrencies, or listing or other\nbusiness decisions by cryptocurrency companies relating to specific cryptocurrencies.\n• Expectations with respect to the rate of inflation in the economy, monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, and currency\ndevaluations and revaluations.\nWhile we have observed a positive trend in the total market capitalization of cryptocurrency assets over the long term, driven by increased\nadoption of cryptocurrency trading by both retail and institutional investors as well as continued growth of various non-investing use cases,\nhistorical trends are not indicative of future adoption, and it is possible that the rate of adoption of cryptocurrencies might slow or decline, which\nwould negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we currently support several cryptocurrencies for trading, market interest in particular cryptocurrencies can also be volatile and there\nare many cryptocurrencies in the market that we do not support. For example we support trading in Dogecoin and we benefited from a surge in\ninterest for Dogecoin during the second quarter of 2021. For the first, second, and third quarters of 2021, transaction-based revenue attributable\nto transactions in Dogecoin generated approximately 7%, 32%, and 8% of our total net revenues, respectively. Our business could be adversely\naffected, and growth in our net revenue earned from cryptocurrency transactions could slow or decline, if the markets for the cryptocurrencies we\nsupport deteriorate or if demand moves to other cryptocurrencies not supported by our platforms. The listing committees of RHC and RHEC\nconduct regular reviews of the cryptocurrencies available on our platforms to ensure that they continue to meet our requirements under our\ninternal policies and procedures (collectively, the “Crypto Listing Frameworks”) for continued support on our platforms and possess the authority\nto delist and cease support for any asset based on various factors. Ceasing support for a cryptocurrency with substantial market interest (or if\nour consideration to cease supporting such a cryptocurrency becomes known) has in the past exposed, and may continue to expose us to\nnegative attention, adversely impacting our business, including revenue loss from no longer supporting a cryptocurrency or customer reaction to\nsuch a decision. For instance, in the past we have encountered an influx of customer complaints related to our decisions to cease support for\ncertain cryptocurrencies.\nVolatility in the values of cryptocurrencies caused by the factors described above or other factors might impact our regulatory net worth\nrequirements as well as the demand for our services and therefore have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAlthough the 2022 Crypto Bankruptcies did not have any material impact on our business—and neither our board of directors nor\nmanagement have to date identified any material gaps or weaknesses with respect to our existing risk management processes and policies in\nlight of recent cryptocurrency market conditions—we remain subject to cryptocurrency market risks. If we are unable to effectively identify,\nprevent or mitigate such risks, the success of our business, our financial condition and results of\n93\nTable of Contents\nour operations may be adversely affected. As part of our overall risk management processes, our management Enterprise Risk Committee,\nwhich comprises senior leaders of the Company, including the CEO, CFO, Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer Chief Security\nOfficer, Vice President of Risk and Audit, and Chief Brokerage Officer and General Manager of Brokerage, among others, reviews on at least a\nquarterly basis risks that are escalated by the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) function. ERM maintains a risk taxonomy and a\nscoring methodology design to ensure risks are evaluated in a clear and transparent manner, and further escalates top risks to the Safety, Risk\nand Regulatory Committee of the board of directors (the “Safety Committee”), along with planned mitigants and monitoring procedures. The\nSafety Committee reviews management’s procedures to identify, assess, manage, monitor and mitigate material risks not allocated to the board\nof directors or another committee. In addition to RHM-level processes, entity-level risk teams affiliated with our operating subsidiaries, including\none at RHC, perform ongoing risk operations, including risk and control self-assessments and maintaining risk and control registers. As\nmanagement identifies operational risks, the entity-level risk team tracks the risk drivers and planned mitigating measures and escalates such\nrisks, as needed, to ERM.\nIn light of events in 2022, including the 2022 Crypto Bankruptcies, cryptocurrency market risks were identified as a top risk to the Company\nand management has accordingly implemented certain measures, including enhanced monitoring for cryptocurrency markets (such as reducing\nnet open position limits with liquidity partners through more frequent settlement; adding additional banking and liquidity partners; monitoring on-\nplatform trading activity, coin deposits and withdrawals; and ongoing diligence for listings and banking relationships). ERM has also provided\nquarterly updates to the Safety Committee with respect to such risks and responses. In addition, RHC and RHEC maintain listing committees as\ndescribed above.\nIn the United States, any particular cryptocurrency’s status as a “security” is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and if we have\nnot properly characterized one or more cryptocurrencies, we might be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other\npenalties.\nWe currently facilitate customer trades for certain cryptocurrencies that we have analyzed under applicable internal policies and procedures\nand, for cryptocurrencies supported on our the RHC platform, that we believe are not securities under U.S. federal and state securities laws.\nDetermining whether any given cryptocurrency is a security is a highly complex, fact-driven analysis, the outcome of which is difficult to predict\nand may evolve over time based on changes in the cryptocurrency and its related ecosystem. Different parties may reach different conclusions\nabout the outcome of this analysis based on the same facts. The analysis may become clearer depending on the outcome in certain cases\ncurrently pending in varying stages of litigation. The SEC Staff has indicated that the determination of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a\nsecurity depends on the characteristics and use of that particular asset. The SEC and the SEC Staff have taken positions that certain\ncryptocurrencies are “securities” in the context of settled or litigated enforcement actions – and we do not currently support any cryptocurrencies\nin the U.S. for which the SEC or the SEC Staff has taken such a position. Otherwise, the SEC has not historically provided advance confirmation\non the status of any particular cryptocurrency as a security. While prior public statements by senior officials at the SEC indicated that the SEC\ndoes not intend to take the position that Bitcoin or Ethereum are securities (in their current forms), Bitcoin and Ethereum were the only specific\ncryptocurrencies as to which senior officials at the SEC had publicly expressed such a view. Moreover, such statements are not official policy\nstatements by the SEC and reflect only the speakers’ views, which are not binding on the SEC or any other agency or court, cannot be\ngeneralized to any other cryptocurrency, and might evolve. For example, Chair Gensler was quoted in a February 2023 interview as saying\n“[e]verything other than Bitcoin” when discussing the SEC’s purview with respect to cryptocurrency and in April 2023 declined to provide his view\nwhen asked if he considered Ethereum to be a security during his testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services\nCommittee. In May 2024, however, the SEC approved the listing and trading of ETFs whose assets include Ethereum on SEC-regulated\nexchanges; some view this approval as an implicit acknowledgement by the SEC that Ethereum is not necessarily a security. Similarly, although\nthe SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology published a framework for analyzing whether any given cryptocurrency is a\nsecurity in April 2019, this framework is also not a rule, regulation, or statement of the SEC and is not binding on\n94\nTable of Contents\nthe SEC. With respect to all other cryptocurrencies, there is currently no certainty under the applicable legal test that such assets are not\nsecurities, and U.S. regulators have expressed concerns about cryptocurrency platforms adding multiple new coins, some of which the\nregulators question might be unregistered securities. Chair Gensler has made numerous statements (including in testimony before the U.S.\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services) indicating\nthat he believes most tokens in the crypto market are securities. Although our policies and procedures are intended to enable us to make risk-\nbased assessments regarding the likelihood that a particular cryptocurrency could be deemed a security under applicable laws, including federal\nsecurities laws, our assessments are not definitive legal determinations as to whether a particular digital asset is a security under such laws.\nAccordingly, regardless of our conclusions, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC or a court were to assert or\ndetermine that a cryptocurrency supported by our RHC platform is a “security” under U.S. law. In July 2022, the SEC filed an insider trading case\nagainst, among others, an employee of one of our competitors in which the complaint alleged that certain cryptocurrencies (none of which we\ncurrently support) were securities under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Additionally, in June 2023, the SEC charged Binance Holdings\nLtd., and its affiliated U.S. entity, among others (collectively, “Binance”) and, separately, Coinbase Global, Inc., and Coinbase, Inc. (collectively,\n“Coinbase”) with operating their respective cryptocurrency trading platforms as unregistered national securities exchanges, brokers, and clearing\nagencies, also alleging that certain cryptocurrencies supported on their respective platforms are securities, including Cardano, Polygon, and\nSolana, which were supported on our RHC platform. The charges also implicated Coinbase’s staking-as-a-service program and its non-custodial\nwallet. Although we have since ceased support for Cardano, Polygon, and Solana, we do offer the Robinhood Wallet, which is a self-custodial\ncrypto wallet. While the SEC’s September 2024 memorandum of law in support of motion for leave to amend the complaint against Binance\nstates that the SEC’s prior use of “crypto asset securities” when referring to cryptocurrency assets did not mean that the SEC was referring to\nthe “crypto asset itself as the security” but that the cryptocurrencies at issue were offered and sold as investment contracts (and therefore are\nsecurities), the SEC’s approach going forward remains unclear in light of this memorandum of law in support of motion for leave to amend the\ncomplaint as well as the August 2024 decision in the SEC’s case against Payward, Inc. and Payward Ventures, Inc. that the cryptocurrencies at\nissue were not themselves securities but were offered as, or sold as, investment contracts (and therefore were securities). The outcome of these\nmatters and decisions by regulators not to bring enforcement actions provides, and any other action, settlement, or related investigation by\nregulators, might provide, additional guidance on the legal status of cryptocurrencies as securities more generally, which has affected and might\nsignificantly affect the actual or perceived regulatory status and value of cryptocurrencies we currently support or might support in the future.\nFrom time to time, we also have received, and might in the future receive SEC inquiries regarding specific cryptocurrencies supported on our\nRHC platform and added features and since December 2022, following the 2022 Crypto Bankruptcies, we have received investigative\nsubpoenas from the SEC regarding, among other topics, RHC’s supported cryptocurrencies, custody of cryptocurrencies, and platform\noperations. During our discussions with the SEC Staff in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Staff asserted that they are considering whether, and\nmay recommend that the SEC find that, certain cryptocurrencies supported by our RHC platform are securities, and in the second quarter of\n2024, we received the May 2024 Wells Notice. The potential action related to the May 2024 Wells Notice may involve a civil injunctive action,\npublic administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding and may seek remedies that include an injunction, a cease-and-desist\norder, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and censure, revocation, and limitations on activities.\nTo the extent that the SEC or a court asserts or determines that any cryptocurrencies supported by our RHC platform are securities, that\nassertion or determination could prevent us from continuing to facilitate trading of those cryptocurrencies (including ceasing support for such\ncryptocurrencies on our RHC platform). It could also result in regulatory enforcement penalties and financial losses in the event that we have\nliability to our customers and need to compensate them for any losses or damages. We could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions,\nincluding disgorgement or penalties which could be material, for failing to offer or sell the cryptocurrency in compliance with securities\nregistration requirements, or for acting as a securities broker or dealer, national securities exchange, clearing agency, or other regulated entity\nwithout appropriate registration. Such an action could result in injunctions and cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines,\nand disgorgement, criminal liability,\n95\nTable of Contents\nand reputational harm. Customers that traded such supported cryptocurrency through our RHC platform and suffered trading losses might also\nseek to rescind transactions that we facilitated on the basis that they were conducted in violation of applicable law, which could subject us to\nsignificant liability and losses. We might also be required to cease facilitating transactions in the supported cryptocurrency, which could\nnegatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, if Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other supported cryptocurrency is\ndeemed to be a security, it might have adverse consequences for such supported cryptocurrency. For instance, all transactions in such\nsupported cryptocurrency would have to be registered with the SEC or other foreign authority, or conducted in accordance with an exemption\nfrom registration, which could severely limit its liquidity, usability, and transactability. Moreover, the networks on which such supported\ncryptocurrencies are used might be required to be regulated as securities intermediaries, and subject to applicable rules, which could effectively\nrender the network impracticable for its existing purposes. In particular, Chair Gensler noted in his April 2023 testimony that “Given that most\ncrypto tokens are securities, it follows that many crypto intermediaries are transacting in securities and have to register with the SEC” and that\ncrypto investors should benefit from compliance with the securities laws. In April 2023, the SEC also reopened the comment period and provided\nsupplemental information on proposed amendments to the definition of “exchange” under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16, including reiterating the\napplicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities. Additionally, any determination that Bitcoin or Ethereum is a security\ncould draw negative publicity and cause a decline in the general acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Also, it would make it more difficult for Bitcoin\nor Ethereum, as applicable, to be traded, cleared, and custodied as compared to other cryptocurrencies that are not considered to be securities.\nIn addition, our growth might be adversely affected if we are not able to expand our RHC platform to include additional cryptocurrencies that the\nSEC has determined to be securities or that we believe are likely to be determined to be securities.\nWe continue to analyze the cryptocurrencies supported on the RHC platform under our internal policies and procedures (collectively, our\n“RHC Crypto Listing Framework”) on a periodic basis to ensure that they continue to meet our requirements for continued support on the RHC\nplatform which include, among other factors, that we continue to believe they are not securities under U.S. federal and state securities laws. We\nmay make the determination to cease support for a cryptocurrency for any one or a variety of factors based on a totality of the circumstances\nunder our RHC Crypto Listing Framework. However, an assertion or determination by the SEC or a court that a cryptocurrency supported by our\nRHC platform constitutes a security could also result in our determination that it is advisable to remove that and other cryptocurrencies from our\nRHC platform that have similar characteristics to the cryptocurrency that was asserted or determined to be a security. If we proactively remove\ncertain cryptocurrencies from our RHC platform because the SEC or a court has asserted or determined they constitute securities or because\nthey share similarities with such cryptocurrencies or otherwise do not meet our RHC Crypto Listing Framework, it has (for instance, with respect\nto Cardano, Polygon, and Solana) and could in the future negatively impact customer sentiment and our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition, especially to the extent that our competitors continue to support such cryptocurrency on their platforms.\nCryptocurrency laws, regulations, and accounting standards are often difficult to interpret and are rapidly evolving in ways that are\ndifficult to predict. Changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could negatively impact cryptocurrency\ntrading on our platforms.\nDomestic and foreign regulators and governments are increasingly focused on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In the United States,\ncryptocurrencies are regulated by both federal and state authorities, depending on the context of their usage. Cryptocurrency market disruptions\nand resulting governmental interventions are unpredictable, and might make cryptocurrencies, or certain cryptocurrency business activities,\nillegal altogether. As regulation of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, there is a substantial risk of inconsistent regulatory guidance among\nfederal and state agencies and among state governments which, along with potential accounting and tax issues or other requirements relating to\ncryptocurrencies, could impede the growth of our cryptocurrency operations. The outcome of the upcoming presidential and Congressional\nelections in the U.S. also presents considerable\n96\nTable of Contents\nuncertainty as to future cryptocurrency regulations. Additionally, regulation in response to the climate impact of cryptocurrency mining could\nnegatively impact cryptocurrency trading on our platforms.\nThe cryptocurrency accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the FASB, the\nSEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. A change in these rules and regulations or interpretations\ncould have a significant effect on our reported financial results and financial position, and could even affect the reporting of transactions\ncompleted before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Further, there are a limited number of precedents for the financial accounting\ntreatment of cryptocurrency assets (including related issues of valuation and revenue recognition), and no official guidance has been provided by\nthe FASB or the SEC. Accordingly, there remains significant uncertainty as to the appropriate accounting for cryptocurrency asset transactions,\ncryptocurrency assets, and related revenues. Uncertainties in or changes in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the need\nto change our accounting methods and/or restate our financial statements, and could impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial\ninformation, which could adversely affect our financial statements, and result in a loss of investor confidence.\nIn addition, future regulatory actions or policies, including, for instance, the assertion of jurisdiction by domestic and foreign regulators and\ngovernments over cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency markets could limit or restrict cryptocurrency usage, custody, or trading, or the ability to\nconvert cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies. For example, Chair Gensler remarked several times in 2021 and 2022 on the need for further\nregulatory oversight of crypto trading and crypto lending platforms. Additionally in February 2023, the SEC issued a new rule proposal (the\n“February 2023 Custody Rule Proposal”) related to the custody of client assets by registered investment advisers, which, if adopted as\nproposed, would expand the existing custody rules to apply to a broad range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, and would require that any\nclient assets be maintained by a qualified custodian. In connection with the announcement of the February 2023 Custody Rule Proposal, Chair\nGensler noted that “Based upon how crypto platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians.” If the\nFebruary 2023 Custody Rule Proposal is adopted as proposed, and we are not deemed to be a “qualified custodian,” depending on how such\nproposal is applied, we may be required to cease our custodial crypto offerings under certain circumstances, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business. Some lawmakers and regulators have also raised questions about Transaction Rebates from cryptocurrency\ntrading. Transaction Rebates from cryptocurrency trading have historically, and might continue, to comprise a significant percentage of our total\nnet revenues. Any future regulatory actions or policies could reduce the demand for cryptocurrency trading and might materially decrease our\nrevenue derived from Transaction Rebates in absolute terms and as a proportion of our total revenues.\nIn March 2022, the SEC Staff issued SAB 121 requiring crypto platforms to recognize a liability and a corresponding asset equal to the fair\nvalue of the cryptocurrencies the entity safeguards on behalf of users. Such accounting treatment enhances the information received by\ninvestors regarding potential liabilities upon theft or loss of cryptocurrencies. But such treatment has also caused some users to question how\nsafeguarded cryptocurrencies would be treated in a bankruptcy. We implemented SAB 121 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, with\nretrospective application to the beginning of 2022. As a result of (and solely by virtue of) our implementation of SAB 121, the cryptocurrency we\ncustody for users now appears on our balance sheets as an asset. In January 2023, the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York\nissued a ruling in In re Celsius Network LLC, that certain crypto assets held by Celsius customer accounts were the property of Celsius’s estate\nand that the holders of such accounts are unsecured creditors. However, unlike the terms of our user agreement, the terms of Celsius’s user\nagreement unambiguously provided that the rights to cryptocurrency held, including ownership rights, belonged to Celsius. Based on the terms\nof our user agreement, the structure of our crypto offerings, and applicable law, after consultation with internal and external legal counsel, we\nbelieve that the cryptocurrency we hold in custody for users of our platforms should be respected as users’ property (and should not be available\nto satisfy the claims of our general creditors) in the event we were to enter bankruptcy. Although we are well-capitalized, to the extent users are\nconcerned that cryptocurrencies might not be secure in a bankruptcy generally, their willingness to hold crypto in custodial accounts and their\ngeneral interest in trading cryptocurrencies might decline. There is also no definitive guidance on\n97\nTable of Contents\nwhether or how SAB 121 applies to broker-dealer entities in a corporate organizational structure where another, separate entity in that structure\nsafeguards cryptocurrencies on behalf of users.\nFurthermore, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act significantly changes the tax reporting requirements applicable to brokers and\nholders of cryptocurrency and digital assets. On August 25, 2023, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service released proposed\nregulations on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers. On June 28, 2024, final regulations were released that require information\nreporting by digital asset brokers on certain digital asset sales or exchanges that occur on or after January 1, 2025, and basis tracking for digital\nassets that are treated as “covered securities” if acquired on or after January 1, 2026. The implementation of these requirements, and any\nfurther legislative changes or related guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, might significantly impact our tax reporting and withholding\nprocesses and result in increased compliance costs. Failure to comply with these new information reporting and withholding requirements might\nsubject us to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Similarly, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published final\nguidance on a new “crypto-asset reporting framework” and amendments to the existing rules for reporting crypto assets under the global\n“common reporting standard” that might apply to our international operations. These new rules might give rise to potential liabilities or disclosure\nrequirements, and implementation of these requirements might significantly impact our operations and result in increased costs.\nOur international expansion also subjects us to additional laws, regulations, or other government or regulatory scrutiny as discussed in “—\nRisks Related to Our Business—We recently started operating in certain international markets and plan to further expand our international\noperations, which exposes us to significant new risks, and our international expansion efforts might not succeed.” For example, when the\nprovisions of Markets in the Crypto Asset Regulation (“MiCA”) take effect on December 30, 2024, we will be subject to the authorization,\ncompliance, and disclosure regime of MiCA for crypto asset service providers (“CASP”) and issuers of certain crypto assets. We will need to\nobtain a MiCA compliant CASP license in our home member state and compliance with such regulation will require the implementation of new\nsystems and processes, and updates to our policies. While MiCA provides member states with the option of implementing a transitional period\nfrom December 30, 2024 to July 1, 2026, at this time, Lithuania’s Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Lithuania have proposed a MiCA\ntransitional period for registrants in Lithuania to June 1, 2025. The relevant Lithuanian authorities are actively preparing for MiCA regulation, but\nthe application process in Lithuania has not yet been finalized. Notwithstanding the transitional period, however, if we are unable to obtain a\nMiCA compliant CASP license by the end of the year, we may need to cease operations in several member states in the EU. Obtaining a MiCA\ncompliant CASP license in our home EU member state could take longer than we expect and would adversely affect our international operations.\nOur Crypto Transfers, Robinhood Wallet, and Robinhood Connect features could result in loss of customer assets, customer disputes,\nand other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact trading volumes and transaction-based revenues.\nIn the United States, we allow customers to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies to and from our RHC platform through our Crypto\nTransfers feature in the states in which RHC operates (other than New York, where our regulatory application is still pending). Since July 2024,\nwe also allow customers in select jurisdictions in Europe to deposit crypto onto our RHEC platform, and since August 2024, we have allowed\ncustomers to withdraw crypto from our RHEC platform. Crypto Transfers are processed using Robinhood’s general custodial infrastructure in\nwhich we hold some cryptocurrencies on behalf of customers; when transactions are completed, coins are allocated to and from individuals’\naccounts in our customer records. Additionally, U.S. customers have access to a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp tool that developers can embed directly\ninto their decentralized applications (“Robinhood Connect”), allowing their customers to use their RHC accounts to buy and transfer crypto, and\nfund their self-custody wallets.\n98\nTable of Contents\nCrypto Transfers initiated by users are subject to a heightened risk of user error. Under blockchain protocol, recording a transfer of\ncryptocurrency on the blockchain involves both the private key of the sending wallet and the unique public key of the receiving wallet. Such keys\nare strings of alphanumeric characters. In order for a customer to receive cryptocurrency on our platforms, the customer will need to arrange for\nthe owner of an external source wallet to “sign” a transaction with the private key of that external wallet, directing a transfer of the cryptocurrency\nto our receiving custodial wallet by inputting the public key (which we will provide to the customer) of our custodial wallet. Similarly, in order to\nwithdraw cryptocurrency from our platforms, the customer will need to provide us with the public key of the external wallet to which the\ncryptocurrency is to be transferred, and we will “sign” the transaction using the private key of our wallet. Some crypto networks might require\nadditional information to be provided in connection with any transfer of cryptocurrency to or from our platforms. A number of errors could occur in\nthe process of depositing or withdrawing cryptocurrencies to or from our platforms, such as typos, mistakes, or the failure to include information\nrequired by the blockchain network. For instance, a user might include typos when entering our custodial wallet’s public key or the desired\nrecipient’s public key when depositing to and withdrawing from our platforms, respectively. Alternatively, a user could mistakenly transfer\ncryptocurrencies to a wallet address that he or she does not own or control, or for which the user has lost the private key. In addition, each wallet\naddress is compatible only with the underlying blockchain network on which it is created. For instance, a Bitcoin wallet address can be used to\nsend and receive Bitcoin only. If any Ethereum, Dogecoin, or other cryptocurrency is sent to a Bitcoin wallet address, for example, or if any of the\nother foregoing errors occur, such cryptocurrencies could be permanently and irretrievably lost with no means of recovery.\nWith Robinhood Wallet, our self-custody, web3 wallet, users have sole access and control over their cryptocurrencies on certain networks\nand personally hold and maintain their private keys. Although we do not custody cryptocurrencies held in a user’s Robinhood Wallet and do not\nhave access to users’ private keys, users who lose their private keys, and thus access to their Robinhood Wallet balances, may react negatively.\nAlthough our account agreements for Crypto Transfers and licensing agreements for Robinhood Wallet disclaim responsibility for losses caused\nby user errors, such incidents could result in user disputes, damage to our brand and reputation, legal claims against us, and financial liabilities.\nAdditionally, allowing customers to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies to and from our platforms increases the risk that our platforms\nmight be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, gambling, money laundering, tax evasion, and scams. Crypto Transfers, Robinhood\nWallet, and Robinhood Connect also expose us to heightened risks related to potential violations of trade sanctions, including OFAC regulations,\nand anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws, which among other things impose strict liability for transacting with prohibited\npersons. We engage blockchain analytics vendors to help determine whether the external wallets involved in Crypto Transfers are controlled by\npersons on prohibited lists or involved in fraudulent or illegal activity. However, fraudulent and illegal transactions and prohibited status could be\ndifficult or impossible for us and our vendors to detect in some circumstances. The use of our platforms for illegal or improper purposes could\nsubject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, prosecutions, enforcement actions,\ninquiries, or requests that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm for us and could cause cryptocurrency trading volumes and\ntransaction-based revenues to decline.\nA temporary or permanent blockchain “fork” could adversely affect our business.\nMost blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are open source. Any user can download the software, modify it and then\npropose that users and miners of Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocols adopt the modification. When a modification is introduced and\na substantial majority of miners consent to the modification, the change is implemented and the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocol\nnetworks, as applicable, remain uninterrupted, although such modifications might cause certain cryptocurrencies to fail our Crypto Listing\nFrameworks. However, if less than a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not\ncompatible with the\n99\nTable of Contents\nsoftware prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” (i.e., “split”) of impacted blockchain protocol network and\nrespective blockchain with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork\nwould be the existence of two versions of the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocol network, as applicable, running simultaneously, but\nwith each split network’s cryptocurrency lacking interchangeability.\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols have been subject to “forks” that resulted in the creation of new networks, including, among others,\nBitcoin Cash, BSV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum Proof-of-Work. Some of these forks have caused\nfragmentation among platforms as to the correct naming convention for forked cryptocurrencies. Due to the lack of a central registry or\nrulemaking body in the cryptocurrency market, no single entity has the ability to dictate the nomenclature of forked cryptocurrencies, causing\ndisagreements and a lack of uniformity among platforms on the nomenclature of forked cryptocurrencies, and which results in further confusion\nto customers as to the nature of cryptocurrencies they hold on platforms. In addition, several of these forks were contentious and as a result,\nparticipants in certain communities might harbor ill will towards other communities. As a result, certain community members might take actions\nthat adversely impact the use, adoption and price of Bitcoin, Ethereum or any of their forked alternatives.\nFurthermore, forks can lead to disruptions of networks and our information technology systems, cybersecurity attacks, replay attacks, or\nsecurity weaknesses, any of which can further lead to temporary or even permanent loss of customer cryptocurrencies. For instance, when the\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic networks split in July 2016, replay attacks, in which transactions from one network were rebroadcast on the\nother network to achieve “double-spending,” plagued platforms that traded Ethereum through at least October 2016, resulting in significant\nlosses to some cryptocurrency platforms. Another possible result of a fork is an inherent decrease in the level of security due to the splitting of\nsome mining power across networks, making it easier for a malicious actor to exceed 50% of the mining power of that network. Such disruption\nand loss could cause our company to be exposed to liability, even in circumstances where we have no intention of supporting a cryptocurrency\ncompromised by a fork.\nMoreover, we might decide not to or not be able to support a cryptocurrency resulting from the fork of a network which might cause our\ncustomers to lose confidence in us or reduce their engagement on our platforms. In assessing whether we will support a cryptocurrency resulting\nfrom the fork of a network, among our top priorities is to safeguard our customer’s assets, and we spend extensive time designing, building,\ntesting, reviewing and auditing our systems to check whether the cryptocurrencies we support remain safe and secure. There are several\nconsiderations that we consider as part of our Crypto Listing Frameworks (including security or infrastructure concerns that might arise with the\nintegration of any new cryptocurrency into the technical infrastructure that allows us to secure customer cryptocurrencies and to transact\nsecurely in corresponding blockchains), which might operate to limit our ability to support forks. Further, we generally do not support a forked\ncryptocurrency that does not have support from a majority of the affiliated third-party miner and developer community. To the extent that we\ndecide not to support, or to cease support of, certain forked cryptocurrencies, it could negatively impact customer sentiment and our business,\noperating results, and financial condition, especially to the extent that our competitors continue to support such forked cryptocurrencies on their\nplatforms.\nWhether we are obligated to provide services for a new and previously unsupported cryptocurrency is a question of contract, as recognized\nin recent published rulings of the California appellate courts and federal district courts. The user agreement each customer enters into in order to\ntrade cryptocurrencies on our platforms clearly indicates that we have the sole discretion to determine whether we will support a forked network\nand the approach to such forked cryptocurrencies and that we may temporarily suspend trading for a cryptocurrency whose network is\nundergoing a fork without advanced notice to the customer. Regardless of the foregoing, we might in the future be subject to claims by\ncustomers arguing that they are entitled to receive certain forked cryptocurrencies by virtue of cryptocurrencies that they hold with us. If any\ncustomers succeed on a claim that they are entitled to receive the benefits of a forked cryptocurrency that we do not or are unable to support, we\nmight be required to pay significant damages, fines or other fees to compensate customers for their losses.\n100\nTable of Contents\nAny inability to maintain adequate relationships with third-party banks, market makers, and liquidity providers with respect to, and\nany inability to settle customer trades related to, our cryptocurrency offerings would disrupt our ability to offer cryptocurrency trading\nto customers.\nWe rely on third-party banks, market makers, and liquidity providers to provide cryptocurrency products and services to our customers. The\ncryptocurrency market operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The cryptocurrency market does not have a centralized clearinghouse, and\nthe transactions in cryptocurrencies on our platforms rely on direct settlements between us and our customers and direct settlements between\nus and our market makers or liquidity providers after customer trades are executed. Accordingly, we rely on third-party banks to facilitate cash\nsettlements with customers’ brokerage accounts and we rely on the ability of market makers and liquidity providers to complete cryptocurrency\nsettlements with us to obtain cryptocurrency for customer accounts. In addition, we must maintain cash assets in our bank accounts sufficient to\nmeet the working capital needs of our business, which includes deploying available working capital to facilitate cash settlements with our\ncustomers, market makers, and liquidity providers (as well as maintaining the minimum capital required by regulators). If we, third-party banks,\nmarket makers, or liquidity providers have operational failures and cannot perform and facilitate our routine cash and cryptocurrency settlement\ntransactions, we will be unable to support normal trading operations on our cryptocurrency trading platforms and these disruptions could have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, if we fail to maintain cash assets in our bank accounts\nsufficient to meet the working capital needs of our business and necessary to complete routine cash settlements related to customer trading\nactivity, such failure could impair our ability to support normal trading operations on our cryptocurrency platforms, which could cause\ncryptocurrency trading volumes and transaction-based revenues to decline significantly.\nWe might also be harmed by the loss of any of our banking partners and market makers. As a result of the many regulations applicable to\ncryptocurrencies or the risks of cryptocurrencies generally, many financial institutions have decided, and other financial institutions might in the\nfuture decide, not to provide bank accounts (or access to bank accounts), payments services, or other financial services to companies providing\ncryptocurrency products, including us. For instance, in May 2023, two prominent market makers announced their respective decisions to limit\ntheir offerings in cryptocurrency trading within the United States. If we or our market makers cannot maintain sufficient relationships with the\nbanks that provide these services, if banking regulators restrict or prohibit banking of cryptocurrency businesses, if these banks impose\nsignificant operational restrictions, or if these banks were to fail or be taken over by the FDIC, such as occurred in the 2023 Banking Events, it\ncould be difficult for us to find alternative business partners for our cryptocurrency offerings, which would disrupt our business and could cause\ncryptocurrency trading volumes and transaction-based revenues to decline significantly.\nWe might also be harmed by the loss of any of our liquidity partners. Unlike our customers’ orders for other cryptocurrencies, which are\ncurrently fulfilled by market makers, our RHC customers’ orders for USD coin (“USDC”), a stablecoin backed by dollar denominated assets held\nby the issuer in segregated accounts with U.S. regulated financial institutions, are fulfilled directly from Circle Internet Financial, LLC (“Circle”),\nthe original issuer and main liquidity provider of USDC. If in the future we decide to offer other stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed\nto minimize price volatility, we may also work directly with other liquidity partners to fulfill those orders. If we cannot maintain sufficient\nrelationships with Circle or any other liquidity providers, it could be difficult for us to find alternative liquidity partners for our stablecoin offerings,\nwhich would disrupt our business and could cause cryptocurrency trading volumes and transaction-based revenues to decline significantly.\nFrom time to time, we might encounter technical issues in connection with changes and upgrades to the underlying networks of\nsupported cryptocurrencies, which could cause revenues to decline and expose us to potential liability for customer losses.\nAny number of technical changes, software upgrades, soft or hard forks, cybersecurity incidents or other changes to the underlying\nblockchain networks might occur from time to time, causing incompatibility, technical issues, disruptions or security weaknesses to our platforms.\nIf we are unable to\n101\nTable of Contents\nidentify, troubleshoot and resolve any such issues successfully, we might no longer be able to support such cryptocurrency, our customers’\nassets might be frozen or lost, the security of our hot or cold wallets might be compromised and our platforms and technical infrastructure might\nbe affected, all of which could cause trading volumes and transaction-based revenue to decline and expose us to potential liability for customer\nlosses.\nRisks Related to Our Spending and Payments Products and Services\nOur spending and payments products and services subject us to risks related to bank partnerships, FDIC pass-through insurance and\nother regulatory obligations.\nWe offer a Spending Account (in connection with a partnership with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.), and we have also partnered, on a non-\nexclusive basis, with Sutton Bank (“Sutton”), an Ohio-chartered bank, pursuant to a license from Mastercard International Incorporated, to offer\nthe Robinhood Cash Card. Under the terms of our program agreement with Sutton, Robinhood Cash Card accounts for our users are opened\nand maintained by Sutton. We act as the service provider to, among other things, facilitate communication between our users and Sutton for\nwhich we receive compensation from Sutton. Additionally, Robinhood branded credit cards are issued by Coastal Bank, a Washington-chartered\nbank, pursuant to a partnership with Visa U.S.A. Inc. Our partner banks are members of the FDIC.\nWe believe our record keeping for our users’ funds held in Robinhood Cash Card accounts at Sutton and held in a Spending Account at our\nother partner bank complies with all applicable requirements for each participating user’s deposits to be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance\ncoverage, up to the applicable maximum deposit insurance amount. However, if the FDIC were to disagree, the FDIC might not recognize users’\nclaims as covered by deposit insurance in the event of bank failure and bank receivership proceedings under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\nIf the FDIC were to determine that our users’ funds held at our partner banks are not covered by deposit insurance, participating users might\ndecide to withdraw their funds, which could adversely affect our brand and our business. Due to the fact that we are deemed a service-provider\nto our partner banks, we are subject to audit standards for third-party vendors in accordance with bank regulatory guidance and examinations by\nfederal bank regulatory authorities and the CFPB.\nAs a result of the stored value Spending Account program and the Robinhood Cash Card, we are subject to federal and state consumer\nprotection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB. As a result of\nRobinhood Credit, we are also subject to a number of state licensing and other regulatory requirements and to payment card association\noperating rules, including data security rules and certification requirements, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to comply. Robinhood Credit is in the process of acquiring licenses in all states where required to do so and is discussing with\nregulators, such as the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance and Massachusetts Division of Banks, certain prior related activity. Failure\nto obtain or maintain these licenses, failure to comply with these rules or requirements, or conducting such activity without a license, as well as\nany breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being\nliable for card issuing banks’ costs, and subject to regulatory fines, penalties, or criminal charges. Violations of any of these requirements could\nresult in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and\nplaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.\nOffering Robinhood Credit increases our exposure to customer defaults and credit risk and could result in losses.\nWe market consumer credit cards, such as the Robinhood Gold Card, originated by our partner bank, Coastal Bank, pursuant to the\nProgram Agreement, and indemnify Coastal Bank for certain losses under the Program Agreement. We partner with Coastal Bank to develop\nproprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate for\n102\nTable of Contents\ncredit risk in connection with selecting customers, managing accounts and establishing terms and credit limits. The revenue generated from the\nProgram Agreement and the extent of credit losses incurred, as well as our ability to offer competitive features such as the Robinhood Gold Card\nRewards Program, depends in part on managing credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns. The models and\napproaches used to manage credit risk may not accurately predict future charge-offs and our ability to avoid high charge-off rates also may be\nadversely affected by general economic conditions including unemployment, the availability of consumer credit and the competitive environment,\nas well as events that may be difficult to predict, such as a general downturn in economic conditions (like the one that occurred in 2022) or public\nhealth threats (like the COVID-19 pandemic). Additionally, if any of these factors make it economically unfeasible for us to continue to offer the\nRobinhood Gold Card Rewards Program and we cease to offer such rewards, it might make Robinhood Credit products less desirable to\ncustomers. Any material increase in credit losses and defaults or inability to retain existing or attract new Robinhood Credit customers could\nhave adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUse of our spending and payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business.\nThe highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, our spending and payments services to move money make us and our customers a\ntarget for illegal or improper uses, including scams and fraud directed at our stored value Spending Account, Robinhood Cash Card, and\nRobinhood Credit customers, money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or\nservices, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and\nother copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of\nalcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity.\nMoreover, certain activity that is legal in one jurisdiction might be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a customer might be found responsible for\nintentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government\nauthorities might seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including Robinhood, that are peripherally involved in the\nsale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities with respect to our\nspending and payments services, these measures require continuous improvement and might not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal\nactivity or improper uses.\nAny illegal or improper uses of our spending and payments services by our users might subject us to claims, individual and class action\nlawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, require us to\nchange our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business. For example, government\nenforcement or regulatory authorities could seek to impose additional restrictions or liability on us arising from the use of our spending and\npayments services for illegal or improper activity, and our failure to detect or prevent such use. Illegitimate transactions can also prevent us from\nsatisfying our contractual obligations to our third-party partners, which might cause us to be in breach of our obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nAny failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property\nrights and technology. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights might not be sufficient to effectively prevent third parties from\ninfringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights or to prevent unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized\nuse of our trade secrets or other confidential information. We make business decisions\n103\nTable of Contents\nabout when to seek patent protection for a particular technology, obtain trademark or copyright protection and when to rely upon trade secret\nprotection, and the approach we select might ultimately prove to be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights,\nhowever, if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. We also might fail to maintain or be unable to obtain adequate\nprotections for some of our intellectual property rights in the United States and some non-U.S. countries, and our intellectual property rights\nmight not receive the same degree of protection in non-U.S. countries as they would in the United States because of the differences in non-U.S.\npatent, trademark, copyright, and other laws concerning intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, if we do not adequately protect\nour rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or\nimpaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Our trademarks might also be opposed, contested, circumvented or found to be\nunenforceable, weak or invalid, and we might not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating them or using similar\nmarks in a manner that causes confusion or dilutes the value or strength of our brand.\nIn addition to registered intellectual property rights, we rely on non-registered proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets,\nconfidential information and know-how. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our\nemployees, contractors, consultants, corporate collaborators, advisors and other third parties who develop intellectual property on our behalf to\nenter into agreements relating to confidentiality and invention assignments, and third parties we share information with to enter into\nnondisclosure and confidentiality agreements. However, we might not have any such agreements in place with some of the parties who have\ndeveloped intellectual property on our behalf and/or with some of the parties that have or might have had access to our confidential information,\nknow-how, and trade secrets. Even where these agreements are in place, they might be insufficient or breached, or might not effectively prevent\nunauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, misappropriation, or reverse engineering of our confidential information, intellectual\nproperty, or technology. Moreover, these agreements might not provide an adequate remedy for breaches or in the event of unauthorized use or\ndisclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully\nobtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or\ninformation to compete with us, and our competitive position could be materially and adversely harmed.\nThe loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying functionality.\nAdditionally, individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements might make adverse ownership claims to our current and future\nintellectual property, and, to the extent that our employees, independent contractors, or other third parties with whom we do business use\nintellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes might arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nIn addition, we might need to expend significant resources to apply for, maintain, enforce and monitor our intellectual property rights and\nsuch efforts might be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or\nproceedings might expose us to a loss of our competitive position, significant liabilities, and damage to our brand, or require us to seek licenses\nthat might not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have been, and might in the future be, subject to claims that we violated third-party intellectual property rights, which, even where\nmeritless, can be costly to defend and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services without infringing, misappropriating or\notherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we might not be aware that our products, services, or marketing\nmaterials are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights and such third parties might\n104\nTable of Contents\nbring claims alleging such infringement, misappropriation or violation. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly high profile,\nthe possibility of receiving a larger number of intellectual property claims against us grows. In addition, various “non-practicing entities,” and\nother intellectual property rights holders have in the past and might in the future attempt to assert intellectual property claims against us or seek\nto monetize the intellectual property rights they own to extract value through licensing or other settlements.\nOur use of third-party software and other intellectual property rights might be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation. The\nvendors who provide us with technology that we incorporate in our product offerings also could become subject to various infringement claims.\nFrom time to time, our competitors or other third parties might claim, and have in the past claimed, that we are infringing upon,\nmisappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the\nresults of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nAny claims or litigation, even those without merit and regardless of the outcome, could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully\nasserted against us, could require that we pay substantial costs or damages, obtain a license, which might not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all, pay significant ongoing royalty payments, settlements or licensing fees, satisfy indemnification obligations, prevent us\nfrom offering our products or services or using certain technologies, force us to implement expensive and time-consuming work-arounds or re-\ndesigns, distract management from our business or impose other unfavorable terms.\nWe expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for financial services grows and as we introduce new\nand updated products and services, and the outcome of any allegation is often uncertain. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from\ninfringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources. Even if intellectual property claims\ndo not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the\nresources of our management and require significant expenditures.\nSome of our products and services contain open source software, which could pose particular risks to our proprietary software,\nproducts, and services in a manner that could harm our business.\nWe use open source software in our products and services (as well as in some of our internally developed systems) and we anticipate using\nopen source software in the future. Some open source software licenses require those who distribute open source software as part of their own\nsoftware product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or to make available any derivative works of the open\nsource code on unfavorable terms or at no cost, and we might be subject to such terms. The terms of many open source licenses to which we\nare subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a\nmanner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. We could face claims\nfrom third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such\nsoftware, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license.\nThese claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a costly\nlicense, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can offer a different solution, which might be a costly and time-\nconsuming process. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to\ndisclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur,\nor could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open source license terms can be ambiguous, vague, or subject to various interpretations,\nespecially given the absence of controlling case law in the U.S. or other courts. Additionally, we may open source some of our own proprietary\nsource code and/or may make contributions to open source software. There is a risk that our proprietary software or contributions may\n105\nTable of Contents\nbe used in such a manner that we may need to enforce our rights to ownership of such open source software, including seeking proper usage,\ncompliance with our license terms, or through litigation. Any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay\ndamages for breach of license terms, or failure to enforce our ownership rights over the use of our proprietary source code could harm our\nbusiness and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Finance, Accounting and Tax Matters\nCovenants in our credit agreements could restrict our operations and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with\nthese covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe have entered into certain credit agreements and might enter into additional agreements for other borrowing in the future. These\nagreements contain various restrictive covenants, including, among other things, minimum liquidity and tangible net worth requirements,\nrestrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to our stockholders, or\nenter into certain types of related person transactions. These agreements also contain financial covenants, including obligations to maintain\ncertain capitalization amounts and other financial ratios. These restrictions might restrict our current and future operations, including our ability to\nincur debt to increase our liquidity position.\nOur ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by events beyond our control that could cause us to be unable to comply.\nThe credit agreements provide that our breach or failure to satisfy some of these covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence\nof an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, our lenders might have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the agreements. If the debt\nunder the credit agreements were to be accelerated, and if we did not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay\nit, it would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage might be inadequate or expensive.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. We\nare subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. These claims can involve substantial amounts of money and involve significant defense\ncosts. It is not possible to prevent or detect all activities giving rise to claims and the precautions we take might not be effective in all cases. We\nmaintain voluntary and required insurance coverage, including, among others, general liability, property, director and officer, excess-SIPC, cyber\nand data breach, crime, and fidelity bond insurance. Our insurance coverage is expensive and maintaining or expanding our insurance coverage\nmight have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty\ndenial of coverage, default or insolvency, and might be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from processing,\noperational, and technological failures. Furthermore, for certain lines of coverage, continued insurance coverage might not be available to us in\nthe future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available\ninsurance coverage, or the occurrence of material changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large\ndeductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n106\nTable of Contents\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws and policies could adversely impact our tax liabilities.\nWe are, and may in the future become, subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign tax laws and regulations, which might in the future\nmake changes to corporate income tax rates, the treatment of foreign earnings, or other income tax laws that could have an adverse impact on\nour business, result of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. The determination of our tax liabilities requires\nsignificant judgment and, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is\ncomplex and uncertain. Although we believe our determinations are reasonable, the ultimate amount of our tax obligations owed might differ\nfrom the amounts recorded in our financial statements in the event of a review by applicable tax authorities and any such difference could have\nan adverse effect on our results of operations. Tax authorities might also disagree with certain positions we have taken or might take in the\nfuture, which could subject us to additional tax liabilities.\nOur corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies also contemplate future growth in international markets, and consider the\nfunctions, risks, and assets of various entities involved in intercompany transactions. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we\noperate may challenge our methodologies for valuing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with\nour determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions.\nIn addition, from time to time, proposals are introduced in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, as well as by foreign governments, to\nimpose new taxes on a broad range of financial transactions, including transactions that occur on our platforms, such as the buying and selling\nof stocks, derivative transactions, and cryptocurrencies. If enacted, such financial transaction taxes could increase the cost to customers of\ninvesting or trading on our platforms and reduce or adversely affect U.S. market conditions and liquidity, general levels of interest in investing,\nand the volume of trades and other transactions from which we derive transaction-based revenues. Any financial transaction tax implemented in\nany jurisdiction in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and as a\nretail brokerage we could be impacted to a greater degree than other market participants.\nWe also are subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, excise, goods and services, and property\ntaxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Specifically, we might be subject to ''digital service taxes'' or new allocations of tax as\na result of increasing efforts by certain jurisdictions to tax cross border activities that might not have been subject to tax under existing\ninternational tax principles. Companies such as ours could be adversely impacted by such taxes.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income could be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) available to reduce future taxable income. However, under\nSections 382 and 383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” (as defined by the Code) may be subject to limitations\non its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset future taxable income. If it is determined\nthat we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we undergo one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in\nour stock, then our ability to utilize NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes could be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and similar\nstate provisions. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under\nSection 382 or 383 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of any companies that we acquire in the future may be subject to\nlimitations. For these reasons, we might not be able to utilize our NOLs, even if we maintain profitability.\n107\nTable of Contents\nOur tax information reporting obligations are subject to change.\nAlthough we believe we are compliant with the tax reporting and withholding requirements with respect to our customers’ transactions in the\njurisdictions in which we operate, various U.S., state or foreign tax authorities might significantly change applicable tax reporting requirements or\ndisagree with the exact application of new or existing requirements. If the taxing authorities determine that we are not in compliance with our tax\nreporting or withholding requirements with respect to customer asset transactions, we may be exposed to additional withholding obligations,\nwhich could increase our compliance costs and result in penalties.\nWe track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in\nsuch metrics could harm our reputation, adversely affect our stock price, and result in litigation.\nWe track certain operational metrics using internal company data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and operate,\nincluding metrics such as Funded Customers, AUC, and Gold Subscribers, as well as cohorts of our customers, which have not been validated\nby any independent third party and which might differ from estimates or similar metrics published by other parties due to differences in sources,\nmethodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations and our\nmethodologies for tracking these metrics have changed in the past and might change further over time, which could result in unexpected\nchanges to our metrics or otherwise cause the comparability of such metrics from period to period to suffer, including the metrics we publicly\ndisclose. For example, prior to our becoming self-clearing in November 2018, we relied on a third-party provider for our clearing operations, and\nused data collected by that third party to compute certain metrics, such as Funded Customers, that, since November 2018, we have calculated\nbased on data sourced and processed internally. In addition, if the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or\novercount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report might not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in\nmeasuring how our platforms are used across large populations globally. You should not place undue reliance on such operational metrics when\nevaluating an investment in our Class A common stock. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Key Performance Metrics” for definitions of our key operational metrics.\nIf our operational metrics are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if\nwe discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation could be significantly harmed, the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock could decline and we might be subject to stockholder litigation, which could be costly.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as well as required disclosure controls and procedures, our\nability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the SEC require, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop could become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In\naddition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new\nbusiness processes, systems and controls to accommodate such changes. We have limited experience with implementing the systems and\ncontrols that are necessary to operate as a public company, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by\nthe relevant regulatory bodies. Additionally, if these\n108\nTable of Contents\nnew systems, controls or standards and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as\nintended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports or\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business might be harmed if we experience problems with any\nnew systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that might\narise. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could be discovered in the future. Any failure to\ndevelop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause\nus to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods.\nAny failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that are required in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or\ninternal control over financial reporting could harm our business, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our\nreported financial and other information, and result in us becoming subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are\nlisted, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, any of which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock\nand have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, if we are unable to\ncontinue to meet these requirements, we might not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock has been and might continue to be volatile and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and might continue to be highly volatile and could continue to be subject to\nfluctuations in response to one or more of the risk factors described in this report, many of which are beyond our control. For example, on\nNovember 8, 2022 (the day that FTX halted all non-fiat customer withdrawals from its platform) the intra-day trading price of our Class A common\nstock fell as much as 18%, and on December 14, 2022 (the day the December 2022 Rule Proposals were announced), the intra-day trading\nprices of our Class A common stock fell as much as 5.3%. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class\nA common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Additional factors that could have a significant\neffect on the trading price of our Class A common stock include:\n• publication of research reports about us, our competitors, or our industry, or changes in, or failure to meet, estimates made by securities\nanalysts or ratings agencies of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of\nanalyst coverage;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\n• the public’s perception of the quality and accuracy of our key metrics on our customer base and engagement;\n• the public’s reaction to our media statements, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• the extent to which retail and other individual investors (as distinguished from institutional investors), including our customers, invest in\nour Class A common stock, which might result in increased volatility; and\n109\nTable of Contents\n• media coverage related to certain individuals and entities identified as having owned our stock, and any speculation related to plans to\ndispose of their holdings.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the trading price of a particular company’s securities, securities\nclass action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs\nand a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nFurther, if the market price of our Class A common stock is above the level that investors determine is reasonable for our Class A common\nstock, some investors might attempt to short our Class A common stock, which would create additional downward pressure on the trading price\nof our Class A common stock.\nSubstantial future issuances or sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could result in significant dilution to\nour stockholders and such issuances or sales, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our founders and their related entities hold approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock (and, as\ndescribed in the following risk factor, over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock). If our founders or other significant\nstockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, large amounts of stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ncause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline substantially.\nSimilarly, significant numbers of shares are subject to future issuance including under outstanding warrants held by pre-IPO investors, and\nunder outstanding stock options and RSUs held by employees and other service providers, and significant numbers of additional shares are\navailable for award grant purposes under our 2021 Plan and for issuance under our ESPP. All of these shares will become eligible for sale in the\npublic market upon exercise, vesting, or settlement, as applicable (and to the extent granted in the discretion of our board of directors, in the\ncase of shares available for grant). These and any future issuances of shares of our capital stock, or of securities convertible into or exercisable\nfor our capital stock could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in a significant dilution for stockholders.\nWe have authorized more capital stock in recent years to provide additional stock options and RSUs to our employees and to permit for the\nconsummation of equity and equity-linked financings and might continue to do so in the future. Our employee headcount has increased\nsignificantly in the past few years, so the amount of dilution due to awards of equity-based compensation to our employees could be substantial.\nFurther, any sales of our Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of our Class B common\nstock, as stock options are exercised, or as RSUs are settled) might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time\nand at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more\ndifficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nThere are no guarantees that we will repurchase shares under the Repurchase Program or that the Repurchase Program will result in\nincreased shareholder value.\nOn May 28, 2024, Robinhood announced that its board of directors approved the Repurchase Program authorizing the Company to\nrepurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding Class A common stock to return value to shareholders. In July 2024, Robinhood began to execute\non the Repurchase Program. While the Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date, the Company’s management currently expects\nto conduct the Repurchase Program over a period of two to three years, beginning in the third quarter of 2024. The timing and amount of\nrepurchase transactions will be determined by the Company from time to time at its discretion based on its evaluation of market conditions,\nshare price, and other factors, and repurchase transactions may be made using a variety of methods, such as open market share repurchases,\nincluding the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the\n110\nTable of Contents\nExchange Act, or other financial arrangements or transactions. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any\nparticular amount of Class A common stock, and the Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s\ndiscretion. As a result, there is no guarantee with respect to the timing or amount of any future share repurchases, or that we will repurchase the\nfull amount authorized under the Repurchase Program. Other factors, including changes in tax or securities laws, such as the U.S. Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 which imposes a corporate excise tax of 1% on net stock repurchases, could also impact our stock repurchases.\nThere are a number of ways in which the Repurchase Program could fail to result in enhanced shareholder value. For example, any failure\nto repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact the trading price of our Class A common stock. The\nexistence of the Repurchase Program could also cause our stock price to trade higher than it otherwise would and could potentially reduce the\nmarket liquidity for our stock. The trading price of our Class A common stock could decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and\nshort-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the Repurchase Program. Any announcement of a pause in, or termination\nof, the Repurchase Program may also result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, there is no guarantee\nthat our stock repurchases will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we grant to our employees.\nAdditionally, repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we have\navailable to fund working capital, capital expenditures, capital preserving investments, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other\ngeneral corporate purposes, and there are no guarantees that the Repurchase Program will result in increased shareholder value. Furthermore,\nthe timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements and other relevant factors. If we are unable to, or choose not to, repurchase shares under the Repurchase Program, this may have\na negative impact on the perception of the Company as an investment opportunity by shareholders or investment analysts, which may in turn\nnegatively impact the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our founders, which limits your\nability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. In addition, the Founders’ Voting Agreement\nand any future issuances of our Class C common stock could prolong the duration of our founders’ voting control.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class C common stock has\nno voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our founders and certain of their related entities (“Founder Affiliates”) together hold all of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Tenev, who is also our CEO, President and Chair of our board\nof directors, and Mr. Bhatt, who is a director, collectively with their related entities hold over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock. As a result, our founders have the ability to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders,\nincluding the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our Charter and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our\n“Bylaws”) and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction.\nIn addition, our founders and Founder Affiliates have entered into a voting agreement (the “Founders’ Voting Agreement”) in which they have\nagreed, among other things, (i) to vote all of the shares of our common stock held by such founder or Founder Affiliate for the election of each\nfounder to, and against the removal of each founder from, our board of directors, (ii) to vote together in the election of other directors generally,\nsubject to deferring to the decision of the nominating and corporate governance committee in the event of any disagreement between the\nfounders, (iii) effective upon a founder’s death or disability, to grant a voting proxy to the other founder with respect to shares of our common\nstock held by the deceased or disabled founder or over which he was entitled to vote (or direct the voting) immediately prior to his death or\ndisability, and (iv) to grant each other rights of first offer in the event of\n111\nTable of Contents\nproposed transfers that would otherwise cause Class B shares to convert into Class A shares under our Charter. The Founders’ Voting\nAgreement has the effect of concentrating voting power in our founders (or either one of them).\nFurther pursuant to the equity exchange right agreements entered into between us and each of our founders in connection with our IPO,\neach of our founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange, for shares of Class B common stock, any shares of Class A\ncommon stock received by them upon the vesting and settlement of pre-IPO RSUs (the “Equity Exchange Rights”). Any exercise by our founders\nof these Equity Exchange Rights will dilute the voting power of holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur founders might have interests that differ from yours and might vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your\ninterests. Therefore, the founders’ concentrated voting control might have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of\nour Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our Company, and\nmight ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests\ncould cause conflicts of interest between our founders and our other stockholders, which might result in our founders undertaking, or causing us\nto undertake, actions that would be desirable for our founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock. Because the shares of our Class C common stock have no voting\nrights, except as required by law, if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the voting control of our founders could be maintained for a\nlonger period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock.\nCertain provisions in our Charter and our Bylaws and of Delaware law as well as certain FINRA rules might prevent or delay an\nacquisition of Robinhood, which could decrease the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Charter and our Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that might have the effect of deterring takeovers by making such\ntakeovers more expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt\na hostile takeover, such as a classified board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, and the ability of our\nboard of directors to designate the terms of preferred stock and authorize its issuance without stockholder approval. We believe these provisions\nwill protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of\ndirectors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make\nRobinhood immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer might be considered beneficial by some stockholders\nand could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of Robinhood and our stockholders.\nAccordingly, if our board of directors determines that a potential acquisition is not in the best interests of Robinhood and our stockholders, but\ncertain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to Robinhood and our stockholders, such stockholders might elect to sell\ntheir shares in Robinhood and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decrease. These and other provisions of our Charter, our\nBylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control, which might limit the\nopportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock and might also affect the price that some\ninvestors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, a third party attempting to acquire us or a substantial position in our Class A common stock might be delayed or ultimately\nprevented from doing so by change in ownership or control regulations to which certain of our regulated subsidiaries are subject. For example,\nFINRA Rule 1017 generally provides that FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a single person or\nentity owning, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of a FINRA member firm’s equity and would include a change in control of a parent company\nand similar approval from the Financial Conduct\n112\nTable of Contents\nAuthority, which regulates our U.K. authorized broker-dealer subsidiary, must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a\nperson or entity holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the equity or voting power of a U.K. authorized person or the parent of a U.K.\nauthorized person. These and any other applicable regulations relating to changes in control of us or our regulated subsidiaries could further\nhave the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of us.\nThe exclusive forum provisions of our Charter could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for some types of\nlawsuits against us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole\nand exclusive forum for a number of types of actions or proceedings shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of\nChancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, another state court sitting in the State of Delaware) (or, if no state court located within the\nState of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over\nindispensable parties named as defendants. Our Charter also provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive\nforum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Nothing in our Charter precludes stockholders that assert\nclaims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in any court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and\nconsented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions might limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its\nchoosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which might discourage lawsuits against us and our directors,\nofficers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been\nchallenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court\nwere to find the exclusive forum provisions in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nITEM 2.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nActual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required.\nPotential risk factors that could cause differences including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in the\npress release we issued today, the earnings presentation and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com.\nToday's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures we consider most\ncomparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start by reiterating Robinhood’s three areas of focus. Number one, winning the active trader\nmarket. Number two, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number three, expanding internationally. In Q3, we continued\nto make progress on all these fronts.\nIn fact, our results after the first three quarters of the year have already broken through a number of full-year records, and we have\nanother quarter in front of us to take these results even higher.\nJust to share a few examples. First, Q3 net deposits were $10 billion or more for the third straight quarter as we continue to increase\nwallet share. This brings us to $34 billion year-to-date, above our 2020 record of $31 billion, and also takes our customer assets\nunder custody to a record high of $152 billion.\nSecond, Q3 options contracts were up 47% year-over-year to a new record as we keep winning with active traders. This brings our\nyear-to-date total to 1.2 billion contracts, edging out our full year high from 2021.\nAnd third, Q3 was another strong financial quarter, with our second highest revenues ever. Revenues grew 36% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 96% from a year ago. Looking year to date, revenues of nearly $2 billion have already broken last\nyear's record $1.9 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 is multiples of any prior year.\nIt's energizing to see our business performing well like this, but we're even more excited about our product roadmap. A key part of\nincreasing wallet share with customers is growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of 2.2 million in Q3.\nAnd one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold Card. When I've talked to Robinhood customers\nin recent months, the Gold Card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don't have it, they want to know\nwhen they're going to get it. And I hear you. We are working hard to increase the rollout. But we're also being patient and carefully\nstudying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time.\nWhile it's still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold Card customers. First, customers love the Gold\nCard. App Store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 5-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card,\nthe digital app and of course, the 3% rewards.\nSecond, the early customer behavior is in line with our expectations. It looks like the Gold Card is top of wallet for most customers,\nand early data shows that we're retaining approximately 95% of Gold Card customers following their first transaction. We're also\nstarting to see customer spending grow and loan balances revolve as expected.\nThird, Gold Card customers are also contributing meaningfully higher Net Deposits versus similar customers. It's great to see the\nearly additional benefits to the platform. All in all, while it's still quite early, we're further increasing confidence that we can scale the\nGold Card significantly over time. Now let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional\nthoughts.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Vlad, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In Q3, we had another strong quarter, growing revenues 36% and driving\n77% incremental adjusted EBITDA margins versus a year ago. Q3 business results also set a number of new highs, including\nassets under custody, options contracts, cash sweep balances, and retirement AUC, as well as multi-year highs for equity volumes\nand margin balances.\nAnd, as we entered 2024 focused on driving another year of profitable growth, we are excited that we have already broken records\nfor full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. Looking at the progress we made in Q3 versus a year ago. Assets\nunder custody grew 76% to a record $152 billion.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nNet deposits were $10 billion plus for the third straight quarter and $39 billion over the past year. This translates to annualized net\ndeposit growth rates of 29% in Q3 and 45% over the past year. Total net revenues grew 36% to $637 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $268 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 42%. And net income grew to\n$150 million or $0.17 per share. This was reduced by $0.01 for a regulatory accrual in the quarter.\nWe're pleased with these results, which marked our fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability and ninth straight quarter of positive\nadjusted EBITDA. Now let's look more closely at Q3 revenues, which increased year over year across all three categories.\nTransaction based revenues grew 72% as we drove higher volumes and market share gains across all trading products. It was great\nto see option, equity and crypto volumes up 47%, 65% and over 100% from a year ago, respectively. Net interest revenues\nincreased 9% as we grew interest-earning assets and securities lending activity improved.\nThis included customers growing their cash sweep balances 80% year-over-year and margin balances building to a two year high.\nLastly, other revenues grew by 42% as we added over 850,000 Gold subscribers in the past year to reach a record 2.2 million\nsubscribers and record annualized recurring Gold subscription revenue of over $110 million.\nI would also note that our Q3 revenues include the impact of contra revenues from amortizing matches on customer deposits and\ntransfers. Q3 contra revenues were $27 million, up $14 million sequentially, mostly driven by the 1% Gold deposit boost.\nWe expect contra revenues to grow sequentially by a similar amount in Q4 and then grow much slower in 2025. To provide some\nmore context. Customers love the matches we provide on asset transfers and IRA contributions, and we are seeing great payback\nperiods on these matches.\nAt the same time, the 1% Gold deposit boost has not driven as much incremental customer activity as our other promotions. So,\nwe've decided to wind down in November to focus on offers that resonate more with customers.\nAs an example, we doubled down recently our HOOD Week promotion by offering a range of matches on asset transfers. And in just\ntwo weeks, this led $2 billion of transfers in from brokerage incumbents that averaged over $130,000 per customer.\nStepping back, when we reflect on our revenues so far this year, it feels good that our last three quarters are the three highest in\nCompany history.\nTurning to Q3 expenses, we had another good quarter of expense discipline. Combined adjusted operating expenses and SBC was\n$476 million in Q3 in the middle of our 2024 outlook range on a quarterly basis.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we are pleased that we are still on track for full year outlook range of $1.85 to $1.95 billion of adjusted\noperating expenses and SBC, even while driving nearly 40% year over year revenue growth for the first three quarters of the year.\nWe anticipate will likely finish near the top end of that range given our continued growth investments to finish the year strong.\nTurning to capital management, we started at our $1 billion share repurchase program in July. We allocated $97 million to\nrepurchase 5 million shares in Q3 and made good initial progress on our expected two-to-three-year total timeline. We love\ndeploying capital like this. It lowers our share count and positions us to increase EPS and free cash flow per share over time.\nAnd when we look at last year’s share repurchase, plus, the start of our new program, we have deployed over $700 million to\nrepurchase approximately 60 million of our shares, equivalent to about 7% of our current diluted count. And we are continuing to\nrepurchase shares daily in Q4.\nBefore passing it back to Vlad, I'd like to comment on the strong momentum we are seeing so far in October. Net deposits are north\nof $4 billion, and cash sweep balances are more than $25 billion. As for trading, equity notional volumes are the highest month in\nover three years. Option contracts look to be one of the highest months ever. And crypto notional volumes are over $5 billion, on\ntrack to exceed the Q3 monthly average.\nI would also highlight that our crypto rebates have increased to 48 basis points in October, relative to our 44 basis points average in\nQ3 and 35 basis points at the start of the year.\nSo, we’re really excited about finishing the year strong. Longer term, we are energized by the progress we are making, and believe\nwe are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus net deposit growth,\ndiversified business model and 90% fixed cost base.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Vlad.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jason.\nNow I want to highlight our progress on the first part of our strategy, winning with active traders. Two weeks ago, we held our\ninaugural HOOD Summit in Miami. It was really awesome to have over 400 active trader customers together for a few days, and we\nintroduced three exciting new products.\nFirst, we announced index options, which are one of the fastest growing retail products and make up nearly 10% of US retail options\ncontracts. Our customers have been trading them on other platforms to date, so, they're excited to bring their trades to Robinhood\nand leverage our industry-leading pricing, and we are excited to expand our addressable market.\nSecond, we announced futures. Here we're not only offering industry leading pricing, but also a great customer experience with our\nawesome futures ladder.\nWe continue to believe that futures can be a nine-figure revenue business for us over time. Also, building out the infrastructure\nbehind futures has also enabled us to offer event contracts, including our new Presidential Election Market that we launched this\nMonday.\nIt was great to see customers quickly engage with this new product, trading over 10 million contracts in the first full day and on track\nto more than double that today.\nThird, we launched Robinhood Legend, our new state-of-the-art desktop platform, which we built from the bottom up for active\ntraders. It's clear from customer feedback that Legend is really resonating. So, we're doubling down in this new domain.\nThe team is hard at work to rapidly shift more functionality for customers. As additional context, while we are number one in mobile\ntrading, that's only half of the retail trading market today. The other half is on web where we haven’t meaningfully competed in the\npast. So, launching Legend is doubling our addressable market.\nWe have a lot of momentum in our active trader offering as we close out the year. As I said earlier, Q3 option volumes were up 47%\nyear over year to a new record. In Q3, equity volumes also increased, up 65% year over year to a three year high. And this is even\nbefore the full rollout of index options, futures, and Robinhood Legend.\nIn closing, we had another strong quarter in Q3, and you should know our team continues to work incredibly hard to deliver even\nmore value to our customers. The roadmap is full, there is so much to do, and we are excited to share a lot more with you at our\nInvestor Day in December. Now let's move to questions.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nChris Koegel Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nThank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session we will start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies, ranked\nby number of votes. We passed over questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together\nquestions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So, I'll kick it off with\nour first question from Say, which is for Vlad.\nVlad, when will the Robinhood Gold Card be available to all users?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Thank you for the question.\nI think that the first thing I want to say is we've really been humbled by the demand we've seen so far for the Gold credit card. The\nwaitlist is close to 2 million, and so far, we've rolled it out to about 100,000 customers. And I think if you compare this to how other\nsuccessful credit card programs that are new have scaled, that is a pretty quick ramp.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nBut of course, we also recognize it’s small compared to the waitlist. The waitlist, frankly, exceeded our expectations, and we are\nworking as hard as we can to get it out as quickly as we can. But it's also important for us to make sure we don't incur significant\nnear-term losses. So, we have to understand the customer behavior and the economics because the credit card business can get\nquite big, and also, if we're not careful that could mean losses.\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, we like the behavior we're seeing. And if the behavior we are seeing continues in this way, over the next\nyear we expect to roll the card out to multiples of where we are today.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChris Koegel Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nRight. Thank you, Vlad.\nThe next question is also for you, and it asks, are there any plans to introduce a way to send or receive money to other Robinhood\nusers via the Robinhood ecosystem?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, we've actually experimented with this in the past when we rolled out Robinhood Spending and the Robinhood Cash Card, a\ncouple of years ago. Right now, the focus is really on the credit card offering. We're seeing amazing feedback and strong demand\nfor that. So, we're focusing on making sure we scale that, but we do anticipate growing our offerings, so that anything that you can\ndo on another consumer finance app or product can be done on Robinhood as well. So, this is certainly something that we're\nthinking about.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChris Koegel Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nThe third question's also on Robinhood Gold. So rate cuts make Robinhood Gold worse each time. How will Gold continue to add\nvalue to users, and what new benefits is Robinhood planning to add for Gold users? Also for Vlad.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so the strategy with Gold is to deliver an offering that provides customers with exceptional value in every market environment.\nRegardless of whether the rates are increasing or decreasing, you should be able to get tremendous value from Robinhood Gold.\nNow some of the value props naturally do well in an increasing rate environment. Cash sweep with high APY, is one of them. Other\nproducts tend to be more attractive in declining rate environments. And as a matter of fact, at HOOD Summit, we recently\nannounced that Gold customers will receive differentiated, better pricing on a few of the products we announced.\nSo, the pricing, while industry leading across the board is even better on index options and futures for our Gold subscribers. So,\nwhile rates on sweeps may be coming down because of Fed cuts, we're going to keep investing in Gold, and for every new product\nwe launch, we ask ourselves how can we make it even better for our Gold subscribers.\nAnd as you see, as we continue to roll out new products, Gold should get even better and better.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChris Koegel Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nGreat! Thank you. Vlad. And last question is for you Jason.\nJason, can you describe the plans for the live tax gain and loss monitoring that you are rolling out?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nSure.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nThere's a couple of things I'd highlight on tax management. First of all, we recognize it's really important for customers. Just\nyesterday, we announced a realized P&L tool, shipped, so that one's live for customers now. And we also know that tax lot selection\nin the app is important for customers. And I'm excited to tell you that we have employee beta testing going on right now for tax lots,\nand the team is pushing hard to get it in the hands of customers really soon.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe think it's really good. Yeah. I think you're going to like it.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChris Koegel Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nThat concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies.\nWe appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions of Vlad, Jason, and look forward to more next quarter. So now I'll\nturn the call over to Catherine to lead a Q&A for analysts.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCraig Siegenthaler BofA Global Research - Analyst\nGood afternoon, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. First, we want to congratulate you on the Legend launch. And I saw there\nwere, I think a thousand sign-ups in the first 40 seconds post the launch. But what is the level of sign-ups to date and how many of\nthem are incremental sign-ups to the 24.4 million accounts there are at Robinhood as of September 30?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I mean, the product is not quite ungated in the sense that anyone can just access it. So, we've been rolling out multiples of\nthat number but haven't yet opened it up to everyone. Early feedback is extremely positive. I mean, I know you guys probably see\nthe level of live streamers and folks on social media has been tremendous.\nAnd the team is, I'd say, even more motivated to keep the momentum and make sure the product is better and better because we\nreally feel like we've got something great here.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDan Dolev Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst\nHey Vlad, hey guys, great results again. Very proud of you.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Dan.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nDan Dolev Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst\nYou got it. Yes, of course. Well deserved. I was very intrigued with the Presidential Election Market. It’s gotten a lot of press and\nwe've been getting a lot of questions on it. So, can you give us some color on how it's doing, how accretive it is to overall retention?\nAnything you can tell us about it would be great. Thank you.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So first off, we just rolled out to 100% of customers after starting the rollout just this Monday. So, huge kudos to the team for\nthat. The path to offer this product was paved really less than 30 days ago, and we really moved quickly to make it available to\ncustomers ahead of the election.\nSo, to give a little bit of context around this, one of our focus areas is to win the active trader market. And I think really to do that, our\napproach is that if you're an active trader, using Robinhood should put you in a position, you should really associate Robinhood with\nbeing at the forefront of technology and innovation in trading.\nI think offering products like these, which you can't really find at many of our competitors, is the best way to do that. So, feedback is\nreally good. You can see on social that it's resonating with customers very clearly. But we rolled out to 100% right before the call\nstarted. So, I think it's a little bit early to tell, to give you too much. Other than that yesterday, we did about 10 million contracts, that\nwas pre-full rollout, and we've done even more than that already today.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nOkay. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley, from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPatrick Moley Piper Sandler Companies - Analyst\nYes, Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one on index options and futures trading. Now that you've\nannounced the pricing on those products, I was hoping you could help us better understand the economics there. I know index\noptions carry relatively high exchange fees. So, what do your margins look like in offering those contracts, how much do you expect\nto make per contract? And then maybe as part of that, your expectation for how much volume is going to come from Gold versus\nnon-Gold members?\nAnd then if I could add a follow-on modeling question. It looks like your equity fee capture declined by about 20% sequentially. So,\nany color there on what drove that would be helpful.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nSure, Patrick, I'll go ahead and take both of those. This is Jason. So, going index options first.\nFirst, the non-Gold price will be kind of industry leading at $0.50 per contract and the Gold price will be even better, at $0.35 per\ncontract. Cash-settled index options, as you know, is a really fast-growing segment within options. And so, we see this as a big\nopportunity for us to take market share even faster. As context, we have been taking double-digit market share for some time now,\nand that’s without having the hotter segment offering. Also, on fees like exchange fees, we’ll be passing those through to the\ncustomers.\nOn futures, non-Gold $0.75 per contract and Gold gets an even better deal at $0.50 per contract.\nWe said that futures over time, based on volumes seen at our competitors, we think it could be a nine-figure business for us. So, it's\na big opportunity for us.\nThe second part of your question was equity take rates. There are really two things that affects our take rate on equity. The first is\nvolatility and the second is mix. And what we saw in the quarter was just customers buying more kind of larger, more liquid names.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBrian Bedel Deutsche Bank - Analsyt\nGreat. Good evening, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the cadence of customer pickup as we move into 4Q. Just\non, futures and index contracts in terms of what portion of the user base have you rolled features out to so far?\nAnd what are the rough plans in doing that for the rest of the quarter? And then same on the index options timing of when you\nexpect to roll that out.\nAnd if I could just sneak one more in on desktop users, good to hear the great feedback. Any observation yet on increased velocity\nfrom the folks that are using it so far?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I would say that the folks that use the Robinhood Legend product tend to be among our most active. So, the velocity is quite\nhigh. We rolled it out to 1,000 people during the Robinhood Legend keynote, and it was the first 1,000 people that signed into their\nRobinhood accounts on desktop.\nAnd I think we filled the 1,000 slots in 45 seconds. So those customers were very keen and engaged to try the product. Early\nfeedback is very positive. And I think it's really important to establish a great reputation among active traders because they’re\nnetworked in a way. They talk to each other, they listen to other active traders and what we've been seeing is really positive signs\nfrom the community about Robinhood Legend.\nBut that said, it's not rolled out fully yet. So, we don't have like the perfect picture of what it's going to look like at 100%. But so far,\nwe really like what we're seeing.\nYes, timing on index options and futures.\nSo, the first Robinhood derivatives product that rolled out is our Presidential Election Market. Futures out-rights will probably be\nrolled out in the coming months. But right now, the focus of the futures business is really just making sure everything goes as\nsmoothly as possible for the Election next week. And then, of course, rolling out out-rights is a top priority, index options as well, in\nthe coming months.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDevin Ryan Citizens JMP - Analyst\nGreat. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?\nI wanted to ask a question just on interest rate sensitivity. So obviously, we saw the first 50 basis points of Fed cuts. Last quarter, I\nthink you talked about 25 basis points is a $40 million impact. And that was just essentially the simple math off of balances at the\ntime, and didn't take into consideration potential for accelerating margin utilization or higher securities lending activity or higher\ntransaction activity, which often happens as rates come down.\nSo, I just wanted to get a sense of whether you're seeing or expecting kind of a acceleration in margin, how you would frame the\nupside in securities lending? It seems like we're operating at a depressed level. Do you see a lot of upside in a more normal\nenvironment?\nThen, are there any other kind of offsetting forces we should be thinking about beyond just the simple math of a rate times a\nbalance? Thanks.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, you bet. And the rate times the balance again, this quarter, would be roughly $40 million for each [25 basis point] rate cut. On\nmargin, we've been seeing a really nice growth in margin balances following the reduction of rates for customers. That's continued\ninto October, so that's been moving up. We'll share that number with you here in a couple of weeks.\nIn terms of securities lending, a couple of dynamics going on there. First, on the just the business inputs themselves, we had about\n400,000 additional customers join the program this year and several billion in equities added to the program, which is great for the\nlong-term viability of that program.\nAt the same time, we saw rates on specials that we get, hard-to-borrows, come down a bit versus Q2. And I think that's really what\nyou're seeing. But in terms of the underlying business drivers, we feel really good about that.\nAnd then lastly, we've talked about for some time how we think we have a naturally hedged business model that as rates come\ndown, we see interest rates turn into a tailwind for the business around growth. I think you've already started to see some of that\nwith the trading activity, options that are at an all-time high in Q3, equities hitting a multiyear high. So I’m feeling even more\nconfident about the tailwinds that come from falling rates, and we'll just have to see how it plays out from here.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBenjamin Budish Barclays - Analyst\nSorry about that. I had the phone stuck on mute. Thank you for taking the question.\nI was wondering if you could talk kind of generally about your path to product kind of innovation and launch. It looks like with the\nactive trader offering, the credit card, you're being very kind of cautious and measured in terms of the rollout. How should we read\nthat into future product development? I think we're all expecting a lot to be in announced at the December Investor Day.\nYou've talked about broader ambitions and crypto, global kind of brokerage offerings. So yes, could you talk about sort of your\napproach to like product velocity and how we should think about the pace of rollout for current and future product launches?\nThank you.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think that it really depends on the product we're talking about. I mean, for example, just this week with Presidential Election\nmarket, we started the rollout on Monday and completed it on Wednesday, which is very quick, particularly for a new product. Credit\ncard is a little bit of a different animal.\nI mean nothing technological is preventing us from rolling that out. It's just really looking at other successful credit card programs in\nthe past and making sure that, you know, with a waitlist of 2 million customers, that business could get quite big. But if we don't\nmanage it carefully, losses could get big as well.\nSo, to avoid that we want to make sure we prudently scale it. And so far, we've onboarded about 100,000 customers who love it and\nearly signs are good. And that's roughly in line with how fast other successful card programs have scaled in the 1st year of\noperations.\nSo that one, it's just us making sure that we're understanding customer behavior, understanding credit since that's a new business\nfor us. And we're feeling good. But yes, we recognize the demand is extreme. So we're working to onboard people as quickly as\npossible, and we expect to get to multiples of our current level over the next year.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham and Company.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Todaro Needham & Company LLC - Senior Analyst\nHey, Vlad, Jason. Thanks for taking the question.\nI guess just going back to the futures, index options offerings, any expenses down the road that we should be thinking about\nincreasing on the back of that. I don't recall if we got to kind of that margin of where it should shake out. And then also just what\ndrove the crypto rebate higher to 48 basis points?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nI'll go ahead and take both of those. So first on the crypto rebates, we've been experimenting for some time on crypto rebates, and\nwe've been seeing the rebate rate come up. We always want to have a great prices for customers, but also balance the return that\nwe generate for shareholders on that activity.\nAnd so, we started the year at about 35 basis points, and you've seen it move up, including in October where we're running at 48\nbasis points.\nIn terms of futures and index options, those products really benefit from the broader kind of technology structure that we have at the\nCompany. We have roughly 90% fixed cost base and relatively low variable costs and futures and index options benefit from that as\nwell, which leads to a really high incremental margins as we grow those businesses.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSteven Chubak Wolfe Research LLC - Analyst\nHi. Good evening. I wanted to start off with a question on actually a chart that you had included in a recent presentation deck, just\nshowing the strong relationship between revenues and AUC. It's been a persistent trend over the last few quarters.\nI mean, in this particular quarter, we did see some decoupling amid some of the rate cuts and subdued trading activity. And we're\njust hoping you could speak to your confidence level that, that relationship should ultimately still hold even amid the impact of further\nrate cuts from the Fed.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I feel really good about that relationship, Steven. One way to think about is just bridging revenue from Q2 to Q3, there's really\ntwo things that distinguish our second quarter and our third quarter.\nThe first is in the second quarter, we have seasonally high proxy revenue. That was about $30 million and you saw that reduction in\nQ3 as we move past that seasonal quarter.\nThe second bridge item from Q2 to Q3 is the contra revenues on the match promotions. In the quarter, we saw a step up to $27\nmillion, that was an increase of about $14 million in contra revenues versus Q2. And I think that's showing up in the relationship that\nyour drawing to AUC. Importantly, most of the incremental $14 million related to the 1% boost on Gold deposits, and that's\nsomething that we're winding down in November.\nSo as we look forward to Q4, we expect Q4 to step up contra revenues in a similar amount to what we saw from Q2 to Q3, but then\nsubside and grow at a slower rate. Zooming out feel really good longer term about the core business.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Stein with FT Partners.

Earnings Call - October 30, 2024, 5:00 PM ET\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAndrew Stein FT Partners - Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, could you discuss the deposit trends for some of the recent promotional offers?\nAnd then what's your strategy for deposit bonuses going forward? Thank you.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJason Warnick Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, we love the matches on deposits. We've seen customers really respond to it. From a finance perspective, we track the\nbehavior of the cohorts and dollars that come in. And we've seen, for example, the 2023 match promotions have already paid off.\nThe payback periods are around one year for 1% and kind of in the two-to-three-year zone, trending more towards three years on\nthe retirement matches that are 3%. So, we feel really, really good about that.\nIt's our third straight quarter of $10 billion plus in net deposits from our customers and continuing with the longer-term trend of 20%\nplus growth. The HOOD Week promotions that we did brought in $2 billion, so that was a two-week promotion and really, really\nstrong response from customers.\nAnd in addition to the relatively quick payback periods, we just love the potential for compounding effects for the business over time.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMadeline Daleiden J.P. Morgan - Analyst\nHi. This is Madeline Daleiden on for Ken. Thanks for taking our question. You discussed it a bit already, but we wanted to dig a little\nmore into the strategy around the election-related event contracts.\nSo, can you walk us through your ultimate decision to list these event contracts, how they fit into the product roadmap? And\nultimately, is Robinhood considered getting bigger into these more betting type products? Thank you.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I'd say overall, as a philosophy, we want to make all product categories available for customers over time, particularly for active\ntraders. We want Robinhood to be associated with being at the frontier of innovation and technology in financial services.\nSo, if you look specifically at these event contracts, their regulated swaps markets that really serve as a legitimate hedging\ninstrument for large institutions. And we believe that if any tool or any instrument is available for institutions, then we have to make it\navailable for retail as well.\nI think a nice other secondary impact is it provides people with a reliable data source about where people predict the market will\nland.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nThis concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Vladimir Tenev, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVladimir Tenev Robinhood Markets, Inc. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you to everyone, for listening and to our institutional and retail analysts for continuing to engage. And really a special thank\nyou all the folks on social media who've been posting content and streaming using Robinhood Legend and sharing feedback.

Yearly percentage\nchange represents the most recent calendar month as compared to the same month of the prior year.\nsnotiiDnefi\nFunded Customers: We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45\ncalendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the\nCompany with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint\ninvesting account (which launched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer.\nAssets Under Custody (“AUC”): We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their\naccounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the\nchange in AUC in any given period.\nNet Deposits: We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash and assets\nearned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by\ncustomers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms\n(assets transferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet\ntransfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with\nCompany promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold\nsubscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.\nGrowth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits: When used with respect to Net Deposits, “growth rate” and “annualized\ngrowth rate” provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. “Growth rate” is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12\nmonth period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. “Annualized growth rate” is calculated as Net\nDeposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding quarter, or as Net Deposits for a specified month\nmultiplied by 12 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding month.\nNotional Trading Volume: We define Notional Trading Volume or Notional Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value\n(purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.\nOptions Contracts Traded: We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of\ntime. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\nDaily Average Revenue Trades (“DARTs”): We define DARTs for any asset class as the total number of revenue generating trades for such asset\nclass executed during a given period divided by the number of trading days for such asset class in that period. The monthly metrics slide discloses each\nmonth’s number of trading days for equities and options. For crypto, the number of trading days is equal to the number of calendar days in the month.\nMargin Book: We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we\nare owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\nCash Sweep: We define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of\nparticipating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their\nbenefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based\non the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.\nTotal Securities Lending Revenue: Total Securities Lending Revenue includes net rebates and interest on cash collateral for both margin based and\nfully paid securities lending.\nreaTmdarks\n“Robinhood” and the Robinhood feather logo are registered trademarks of Robinhood Markets, Inc.
