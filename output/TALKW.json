The “Look Who’s Talking” campaign features testimonials from Talkspace members, including brand ambassador and longtime mental health advocate Michael Phelps, and highlights an emerging trend of men candidly discussing mental health challenges. The campaign shows how men are rewriting the playbook for how they deal with emotions, relationships, and life transitions, and includes expert insights about men and their mental health, all featured on the new Talkspace [campaign webpage](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.talkspace.com%2Fmens-mental-health-awareness&esheet=54146011&newsitemid=20241104253439&lan=en-US&anchor=campaign+webpage&index=2&md5=c357de6f163292130bf4ca8d792e76a8). \n\nMen have historically been [less likely to seek mental health support](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fproducts%2Fdatabriefs%2Fdb419.htm&esheet=54146011&newsitemid=20241104253439&lan=en-US&anchor=less+likely+to+seek+mental+health+support&index=3&md5=7cb3c67572f2f34f35e993dc4f37c360) than women, often suffering in silence, but Talkspace sees that changing as more men open up about their mental health and seek therapy. Reflecting the larger trend towards increased access and greater normalization of asking for help in recent years, the percentage of men receiving mental health support increased 36% from 13.1% to 17.8%1. Recognizing this transformative shift in attitude toward men’s mental health, Talkspace’s Men’s Health Awareness Month campaign highlights real perspectives and personal experiences from men on their platform. \n\n“We are witnessing a momentous shift around male attitudes toward therapy. Where society once said silence is strength, we are now recognizing vulnerability as bravery,” said Katelyn Watson, Chief Marketing Officer at Talkspace. “Through the ‘Look Who’s Talking’ campaign, we want to re-write the playbook for men’s mental health and showcase real stories of men ‘talking it out’ in Talkspace therapy. We continue to dispel harmful stigma around therapy and spread the message that men belong there too.” \n\nIn the campaign’s documentary-styled vignettes, male Talkspace members shared: \n\n  * _I work in a high pressure environment. I was getting awards [and doing] amazing things, the people, my loved ones, the people around me, they were happy for me, but I wasn't happy for myself. Therapy for me was my own personal journey to become the best version of myself.__- Carlvin, Talkspace member_\n\n\n  * _Life is very complicated and messy, and I don't have to necessarily go through it by myself. I don't have to rely on my family and my friends to just be the ones listening to me. But I can have someone that has no attachment to anything else, listen to me and give me their professional, but also their unfiltered opinions on things._ - _Evan, Talkspace member_\n\n\n\n“While some men may still hesitate to discuss their mental health, you can help those you care about feel more comfortable about opening up,” said Talkspace therapist [Erica Patton Simpson.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Ferica-patton-simpson-521740231%2F&esheet=54146011&newsitemid=20241104253439&lan=en-US&anchor=Erica+Patton+Simpson.&index=4&md5=7f4e498d272daa034dabaf5823940bb1) “Often it can be helpful to go beyond asking ‘How are you?’ and instead ask more thoughtful questions like ‘What’s on your mind lately?’ or ‘What are some things that have been bothering you?’” \n\nFor more information on the “Look Who’s Talking” campaign and men’s mental health support, visit [talkspace.com/menshealth](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftalkspace.com%2Fmens-mental-health-awareness&esheet=54146011&newsitemid=20241104253439&lan=en-US&anchor=talkspace.com%2Fmenshealth&index=5&md5=298182539b3c5dcf03b5cb33d1bac8bd). \n\n**About Talkspace**\n\nTalkspace (NASDAQ: TALK) is a leading virtual behavioral healthcare provider committed to helping people lead healthier, happier lives through access to high-quality mental healthcare.

We have made meaningful strides in fortifying our relationships with key payor partners who view us as the leading full-scale, pure-play behavioral health provider and truly recognize the importance of our differentiated focus on clinical excellence,” said Dr. Jon Cohen, CEO of Talkspace.\n\nDr. Cohen continued, “The mental health crisis remains a critical issue and Talkspace is at the forefront of addressing this need through our highly qualified network of diverse, clinically-licensed providers and our innovative platform. I'm particularly proud of our expansion to now serve more than 158 million covered lives, including increased access for seniors, teens, and members of our Military - populations with unique and pressing behavioral health needs. Our innovative approach and strategic growth have positioned us as the largest behavioral telehealth network in the U.S., enabling us to meet the escalating demand for accessible, high-quality behavioral health services.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Performance Metrics**\n\n  * Revenue increased 23% over the prior-year period to $47.4 million, driven by a 45% year-over-year increase in Payor revenue and a 17% year-over-year increase in Direct to Enterprise (“DTE”) revenue; partially offset by a 30% year-over-year Consumer revenue decline.\n  * Gross profit increased 15% over the prior-year period to $21.6 million, and gross margin declined to 45.6% from 48.8% in the prior-year period, driven by a shift in revenue mix towards Payor.\n  * Operating expenses were $21.5 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower research and development expenses due to the capitalization of internal-use software costs.\n  * Net income was $1.9 million, an improvement from $(4.4) million net loss in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million, an improvement from $(2.8) million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nTalkspace continues to expect fiscal year 2024 revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $195 million, growth of 23-30%, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4 million to $8 million.\n\n**Conference Call, Presentation Slides, and Webcast Details**\n\nThe Third Quarter 2024 earnings conference call and webcast will be held Tuesday, October 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. E.T.

Because adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We also use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nSome of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA include (i) adjusted EBITDA does not necessarily reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these requirements. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments described herein. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we calculate the measure, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss), income (loss) per share, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When evaluating our performance, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income (loss) and other GAAP results.\n\nA reconciliation is provided below for adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance as the amount and significance of the reconciling items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts. These reconciling items could be meaningful.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nWe calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest and other expenses (income), net, (iii) tax benefit and expense, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, and (v) certain non-recurring expenses, where applicable.\n\n**Talkspace, Inc.** **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n _(in thousands)_| _Unaudited_|  _Unaudited_|  _Unaudited_|  _Unaudited_  \nNet income (loss)| $| 1,874| $| (4,414)| $| (66)| $| (17,876)  \nAdd:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 231| 305| 652| 913  \nFinancial (income), net (1)| (1,701)| (779)| (5,123)| (2,915)  \nTaxes on income| (74)| 14| 123| 165  \nStock-based compensation| 1,931| 1,969| 7,290| 6,401  \nNon-recurring expenses (2)| 89| 105| 1,427| 89  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 2,350| $| (2,800)| $| 4,303| $| (13,223)  \n(1)| For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financial (income), net primarily consisted of $1.5 million of interest income from our money market accounts and $0.3 million in non-cash gains resulting from the remeasurement of warrant liabilities.

This collaboration aims to improve access to mental health resources for the 65+ community, while also reducing healthcare costs, increasing member engagement, and addressing the growing mental health crisis that is prevalent among older adults. \n\nLoneliness is a critical issue for millions of seniors across the U.S., with approximately [40% of individuals](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC7437541%2F&esheet=54140595&newsitemid=20241023796664&lan=en-US&anchor=40%25+of+individuals&index=3&md5=346e232fa5d8b3fed12c368cb9c88004) aged 65+ self-identifying as lonely. In a landmark [2023 advisory](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hhs.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fsurgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf&esheet=54140595&newsitemid=20241023796664&lan=en-US&anchor=2023+advisory&index=4&md5=7cf85d1e679aa9178b696b4a8e77e309), the U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness and social isolation a public health crisis, comparing the health risks of social disconnection to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The advisory further highlighted that loneliness doubles the risk of depression and anxiety and that socially isolated individuals experience higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and primary care usage​. In fact, each socially isolated older adult accounts for $1,643 more in annual Medicare spending costs.1\n\n\"By partnering with Wisdo Health, we are deepening our mental health care expertise for older adults as well as addressing the hidden epidemic faced by this population,\" said Erin Boyd, Chief Growth Officer at Talkspace. \"Together, we offer Medicare Advantage plans a continuum of evidenced-based care, from 24/7 peer communities to therapy with licensed providers, helping them address the unique needs of the senior population at scale.” \n\nWisdo Health brings valuable research and expertise on loneliness and has demonstrated clinically significant reductions in loneliness while improving quality of life and mental health outcomes, including 28% reduction in depression symptoms.2 Its platform uses a patented AI precision matching technology to connect members with trained peers who have been in their shoes, along with 30+ moderated communities and group coaching to build social resilience and healthy habits, all continuously tailored to each member’s unique persona. The platform also generates actionable data on clinical outcomes and gaps in care. When therapy is deemed appropriate or necessary, users will be easily referred to Talkspace therapy and can use their Medicare benefits (depending on their state of residence). \n\n“Peer support provides an evidence-based and scalable solution to address the loneliness epidemic, improve mental health outcomes, and reduce cost, said Wisdo Health Chief Executive Officer Ron Goldman. “By partnering with Talkspace, we are advancing our mission to help people lead happier, healthier lives through meaningful connections and community support.” \n\nThis partnership comes as Talkspace continues to expand its mental health services for older adults, including offering in-network access through [Medicare](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.talkspace.com%2Fcoverage%2Finsurance%2Fmedicare&esheet=54140595&newsitemid=20241023796664&lan=en-US&anchor=Medicare&index=5&md5=8e28600a2c3240255d100622961b5214), now available in 30 states including NY, TX, CA, FL, and OH, along with select Medicare Advantage plans. \n\nFor additional information, contact [Talkspace](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.talkspace.com%2Fdemo%3Fcampaign%3D19596415134%26content%3D652710682482%26keyword%3Dtalkspace%2Bfor%2Bbusiness%26utm_term%3Dtalkspace%2Bfor%2Bbusiness%26utm_campaign%3DSBM%2BBrand%26utm_source%3Dgoogleb2b%26utm_medium%3Dsembrand%26hsa_acc%3D2121985056%26hsa_cam%3D19596415134%26hsa_grp%3D144900942425%26hsa_ad%3D652710682482%26hsa_src%3Dg%26hsa_tgt%3Dkwd-918796151220%26hsa_kw%3Dtalkspace%2Bfor%2Bbusiness%26hsa_mt%3De%26hsa_net%3Dadwords%26hsa_ver%3D3%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw68K4BhAuEiwAylp3knQ3pIkqiDs12-fumJGsn7Wl0zDIeH06df0oe66af0Vtx84G9JDDjhoCnkEQAvD_BwE&esheet=54140595&newsitemid=20241023796664&lan=en-US&anchor=Talkspace&index=6&md5=3027bcb672df8f278b154aa15c2ece6c). \n\n**About Talkspace**\n\nTalkspace (NASDAQ: TALK) is a leading virtual behavioral healthcare provider committed to helping people lead healthier, happier lives through access to high-quality mental healthcare.
