Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter fiscal\n2025 earnings call. First, I'd like to start by expressing my appreciation to Lakeland's Board of\nDirectors for the trust and confidence they have shown by appointing me to be Lakeland's\nPresident and CEO. I'm honored to lead Lakeland Industries and our nearly 2,000 employees\nworldwide. Whose mission every day is to protect the world's workers, first responders and\nTranscript Provided by\ncommunities by providing quality protective solutions for the most critical situations. Lakeland\nhas an exciting runway for growth and has tried to drive revenue and profit growth in key\nmarkets. This executive team and I will leverage Lakeland's strong competitive advantages. With\nour high-value markets to deliver improved results and sustainable growth for our shareholders.\nI also want to thank our customers and distributor partners around the world for trusting us with\nyour lives and safety. Our customers are heroes, and we never take that trust for granted. Finally,\nI want to thank our Lakeland team members across the company for their continued commitment\nand enthusiasm as we further delivered on our strategic initiatives this quarter. During the first\nquarter, this dedicated team has continued to execute our previously communicated growth\nstrategies. And I appreciate all their hard work. We will talk more about those results and\ninitiatives during this call.\nDuring our first quarter of fiscal 2025, our team continued executing our strategic plan of\ncreating a high-performance culture driven by our corporate values, and we believe we are\nmaking excellent progress as highlighted by our strong results, which I will discuss shortly. We\nare investing in high-growth geographies and product segments, including building a premier\nglobal fire brand through product, marketing and sales enhancements. We are also working to\ndrive profitable growth in our industrial product lines through product development, strategic\npricing, channel diversification and operations optimization.\nFinally, as we will discuss more, we continue to look for and acquire companies that improve\nLakeland's competitive advantage in focused markets. As previously announced, we closed on\nthe Jolly Boots acquisition in early February and immediately began integrating their outstanding\nproducts into our global sales platform. Jolly manufactures and sells a premium boots product\nline with a global reputation for safety, design and innovation, and we are excited to add their\nproducts to the Lakeland family of Safety brands.\nWe are pleased to announce that we are currently developing NFPA certified Jolly fire boots for\nthe North American market which we expect to roll out later this year. Along with our Pacific\nHelmets acquisition in November of last year, Jolly acquisition completes Lakeland's head-to-toe\nfire product offering, strengthens our geographic diversity and presents exciting cross-selling\nopportunities with global certifications across Lakeland's existing sales and distribution channels.\nIn early April, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire LHD Group of Germany's\nfire service business, along with the United States, Germany and Australia, our Top 3 global fire\nmarkets and LHD's fire and rescue offerings bring Lakeland a premium product portfolio with\nstrong footprints in Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. LHD's fire turnout gear also\ncomplements and aligns very well with our new Pacific and Jolly offerings in our Eagle\nTechnical Products.\nAdditionally, the LHD care service offerings provide us with attractive recurring revenue\nstreams and gross margins that Lakeland will work to leverage and expand. We are making very\ngood progress on clearing all the closing conditions for the LHD acquisition and expect to close\nthis month. As we have previously discussed, these acquisitions reflect our commitment to\nexecuting and accelerating the pace of our small, strategic and quick SSQ M&A strategy. We\nTranscript Provided by\nstill have a very attractive SSQ acquisitions pipeline, and we will continue to search for\nopportunities that further position Lakeland to execute our growth strategies and invest\nstrategically to broaden and diversify at Lakeland's range of products and end markets.\nI trust everyone has had the opportunity to review the press release and Q1 earnings deck we\npublished last evening. I encourage you to follow along in the earnings presentation as Roger and\nI review our results. As we stated in our earnings press release, we are very pleased with the start\nof our fiscal -- '25 fiscal year. Looking at our first quarter results, our net sales for the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 increased by 27% to $36.3 million compared to $28.7 million in the\nprevious years. We were very encouraged by the growth in our North American and Latin\nAmerican operations this fiscal year as these important geographies grew 18% and 54% year-\nover-year, respectively.\nWhile our Asian business remained soft in the first quarter, we continue to see healthy demand\nfor our high-value fire critical environment, disposables and chemical product categories in\nNorth and South America, led by strong sales efforts and our container program -- programs with\nkey national customers. Our fire services business continues to deepen and broaden, having\ngrown over 92% versus last year's fiscal first quarter driven by our strategic acquisitions,\nsuperior lead times from our manufacturing pipeline and onboarding successes with new\ndistributors.\nOur newly acquired companies, Pacific Helmets and Jolly Boots represented $3.9 million or 11%\nof our total Q1 FY'25 sales. Over the coming months, we will continue to integrate Pacific's and\nJolly's outstanding fire safety products into Lakeland's global sales channels and marketing\nplatforms as we work to proactively leverage synergies across our global portfolio through\nmarket expansion and cross-selling opportunities. During the quarter, we had a very successful\nshowing at the FDIC International Conference, the largest trade show for the fire and rescue\nindustry in North America where we were able to demonstrate to customers our new Pacific\nHelmets and Jolly Boots offerings, along with our outstanding Lakeland and Eagle fire turnout\ngear.\nWe also unveiled a new NFPA certified fire glove that is a major step forward in firefighter\nsafety due to its power luminescent trim that will illuminate dark and smoky areas. In terms of\nprofitability, our first quarter gross margins came in at 44.6%, an increase of 1.2 percentage\npoints over the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year\n2025 was $3.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 40% compared with $2.8 million for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2024.\nRoger will discuss these in more detail later. Our gross margins and adjusted EBITDA for the\nquarter benefited from the improving product and geographical mix of our higher value strategic\nproducts. From an earnings perspective, our first quarter fiscal 2025 net income was $1.7\nmillion, an increase of 25% resulting in net income per diluted share of $0.22 compared to $0.18\nin the prior year.\nAfter quarter end, Lakeland announced its strategic partnership with LineDrive, a leading\noutsourced sales and marketing company for industrial maintenance, repair and operations. We\nTranscript Provided by\nbelieve this exciting partnership will significantly expand Lakeland's products to large industrial\ndistributors and customers in North America.\nGiven the strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our full-year fiscal 2025 revenue and\nadjusted EBITDA guidance, which Roger will also discuss in more detail. Additionally, we\nexpect to make further announcements within the next few weeks regarding our closing of the\nLHD acquisition and revised our guidance again at that time to reflect the impact of LHD on our\nfiscal year results.\nTo summarize, our commitment remains unwavering, and I'm excited to see where this coming\nyear takes us. From here, I'd like to pass it over to Roger and have him cover more of the\nfinancial results for you and provide an outlook for the coming year.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. As noted in our earnings press release yesterday afternoon, we\ndelivered strong year-over-year sales and profitability growth. Looking at our first fiscal quarter\nof 2025, Lakeland delivered sales of $36.3 million compared to $28.7 million for the first quarter\nof last year. Our organic revenue, excluding our Pacific Helmets and Jolly Boots acquisitions,\ngrew by $3.7 million or 13% year-over-year, driven by increases in our fire, chemical, wovens\nand disposable products. On a trailing 12-month basis, Lakeland's TTM revenue as of Q1 fiscal\n2025 is $132.3 million. This is an increase of $18 million or 16% versus the Q1 fiscal 2024 TTM\nrevenue total of $114.3 million.\nWe also saw double-digit year-over-year organic growth across North and South America,\nincluding a 16% year-over-year growth in the U.S., 18% growth across North America and 54%\nin Latin America. Our strong sales growth in North America and Latin America during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 was partially offset by slightly lower sales in Asia and Europe despite\nsome preliminary signs of growth from China. Lakeland's domestic sales were $14.3 million or\n39% of total revenues, and international sales were $22 million or 61% of total revenues.\nThis compares with domestic sales of $12.3 million or 43% of the total and international sales of\n$16.4 million or 57% of the total in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In terms of product mix for\nthe first quarter, as Jim mentioned earlier, our Fire Services business, a key strategic growth\nfocus for the company grew $5 million or 92% versus the same period last year, driven by $3.8\nmillion in sales from our Jolly and Pacific acquisitions and organic growth of $1.2 million as a\nresult of our superior lead times and onboarding successes with new distributors.\nOur disposables category continued to decrease as a percentage of Lakeland sales as a result of\nthe growth in our fire services and chemicals categories and the continued weakness in the\ndisposables product line in Asia. It now represents 36% of the total revenues compared to 43% in\nthe year ago period. However, despite continued weakness in Asia, disposable sales increased by\n$800,000 or 6% versus the first quarter of last year.\nAs Jim mentioned, we do see excellent opportunities to grow both our disposables and woven\nproduct categories due in part to our new LineDrive relationship and accelerating market share\nTranscript Provided by\ngrowth in Latin America. We continue to have success with our North American direct container\nprogram and our oil and gas turnaround business remained strong. Additionally, we are very\noptimistic about our critical environment opportunities as our excellent sales team continues to\nidentify and close new opportunities.\nReported gross profit was $16.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of $3.8\nmillion or 30% compared to $12.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our reported\ngross profit as a percentage of net sales was 44.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as\ncompared to 43.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the previous year, our gross profit\nmargin was helped by a 4.1% improvement in sales mix from higher-value products and a 1.7%\nimprovement in operations costs offset by a 4.6% decrease resulting from the absence of\nnonrecurring upsides in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 as we show on Slide 7.\nLakeland reported an operating profit of $2.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared\nto an operating profit of $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The main drivers for\nthe difference between the two periods were higher sales and gross margin in the current quarter,\nslightly offset by a $3.5 million negative impact from higher SG&A costs. While our operating\nexpenses increased to nearly $14 million for the quarter, $1.2 million of the increase was due to\nacquisition, noncash and nonrecurring expenses and acquired and sales-related growth expenses\naccounted for $1.9 million of the increase.\nOperating margins were 6.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 6.8% for the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for the reasons discussed above. Tax expense for the quarter was\n$388,000 for an effective tax rate of 19% for Q1. Discrete items related to the settlement of the\nPacific and Eagle acquisitions positively impacted tax expense in the quarter. We currently\nestimate an annual tax rate of 25% for the current full fiscal year. Lakeland reported net income\nof $1.7 million or $0.22 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $1.3 million or\n$0.18 per basic and diluted share last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $3.9 million or a margin of 10.6%\ncompared to $2.8 million or a margin of 9.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As shown on\nSlide 7, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter versus Q1 of fiscal 2024 benefited from\nimprovements in our higher value product sales mix and operational improvements, partially\noffset by a $1.6 million decrease resulting from the absence of the previously mentioned\nnonrecurring upsides in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 along with higher selling expenses\nrelated to sales growth and acquired entity OpEx and higher general and administrative expenses,\nmainly professional fees.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, Lakeland's TTM adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impacts of FX\nas of Q1 fiscal 2025 is $16.5 million. This is an increase of $5.3 million or 47% versus the Q1\nfiscal 2024 trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX total of $11.2 million.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Lakeland ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of\napproximately $28.4 million compared to our prior year ended cash balance of $25.2 million.\nOur continued focus on inventory reduction and generating cash flow resulted in an $8.6 million\nreduction, excluding the effects of acquisition and our inventory year-over-year mainly driven by\nTranscript Provided by\na 21% decrease in finished goods inventory. So Q1 tends to be a higher cash usage quarter. Our\nlaser focus on cash further strengthens the company's financial position particularly our robust\nbalance sheet and cash position, which we believe allow us to continue pursuing organic and\ninorganic growth opportunities.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the company had long-term debt outstanding of $13 million. As we\nmentioned in our press release in early February, we drew down a portion of our revolving line\nof credit in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Jolly Boots. We expect to make\nsome repayments of debt in the second quarter but also to draw down on our revolving credit\nagreement for the purchase of LHD.\nIn addition, on March 28, 2024, we completed an amendment to our existing revolver to extend\nthe facility for five years and to expand our line of credit availability up to $40 million with an\nadditional $10 million accordion feature, up from $25 million previously along with improved\nterms. Capital expenditures for the three months ended April 30, 2024 were $500,000. We still\nexpect FY'25 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 million as we develop additional in-\nhouse fire services manufacturing capacity and replace existing equipment in the normal course\nof operations. Monterrey expansion, which we discussed last quarter remains on pause as we\ncontinue to assess weather-related damage to our leased building.\nNow looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2025. Based on our strong start to the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025, our existing backlog and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are revising\nupward our forward-looking guidance for our 2025 fiscal year. Please note that these\nexpectations include the recently announced Jolly Boots and Pacific Helmets acquisitions, but do\nnot include the LHD fire services business, which we expect to close this month. We are\nbecoming more confident in our global sales platform and earning ability, and we now see fiscal\nyear 2025 revenue in the range of $150 million to $155 million.\nAdditionally, we expect FY'25 adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX to be in the range of $17 million\nto $20 million. We expect to update these expectations once we closed the LHD transaction and\nits fiscal 2025 progresses.\nWith that overview, I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim before we begin taking\nquestions.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThanks, Roger. As I alluded to earlier, Lakeland is well positioned for profitable growth, and we\nbelieve our value proposition has never been stronger. Of course, driving execution will be the\nkey. Strong organic growth remains at the heart of our strategy, consistent with our revised\nguidance, we expect organic growth to be in the high single-digit range for the balance of fiscal\n2025 year. We will also continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities and expand our\naddressable markets, geographical footprint and capabilities.\nAcquisitions remain an important part of our growth strategy and increase the trajectory of our\nbusiness. We have a strong balance sheet to support the conversion of our active M&A pipeline.\nTranscript Provided by\nWe will continue to drive process improvement from our operations and finance teams as we\nstrive to maintain the early sales momentum we saw in the first quarter. All in all, I like our\nteam, our strategy and the early returns on our plan.\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator\nInstructions]. Your first question for today is from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH MKM.\nQ: Good afternoon, Jim and Roger. Thanks for taking my call.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThank you.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nHey Gerry.\nQ: First off, I'm going to apologize for any noise in the background. There's some work being\ndone. But with that being said, Jim, congratulations, becoming CEO. And over the course of\nyour interim term, you've also helped expand fire, less on degree of disposable, we'll say, balance\nthe product mix across Lakeland. The line drive seems interesting. Made acquisitions. So there's\na lot going on, all good at Lakeland, but I'm just curious of maybe what you look at as maybe\nyour major milestones over the next maybe two, three, even four quarters with all this going on\ninternally at Lakeland?\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYes. Sure, Gerry. That's a great question. Look, I -- right now, I view my most critical\nresponsibilities as developing our team, finding new additions to our team. And frankly, the least\nfavorite part of my job, exiting people who, I think at some point, we've either outgrown or are\njust no longer where they need to be within the organization. And the first two parts of that\nactually all three are going to take some time. And we've already had a tremendous amount of\nchange within this organization over the course of the last 12 to 15 months. So some of the stuff\nI'm going to take a little bit slower.\nWe're starting to get some traction here on the strategy. We need to fill out our team on the sales\nfront, and we would expect to see a new sales leader here in the not-too-distant future as we\nnarrow down the opportunities we have there and run those out. And then I've got the need, I\nthink, for some HR leadership that I'll need to bring to the table as well. I've spent a considerable\namount of time traveling. I'm in Hong Kong today meeting with the folks from LHD. I was in\nAdelaide, the other day, meeting with the Australian LHD team, and we were course in Cologne\na few days earlier meeting with Germany.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo we're -- I'd like to say the sun never sets on Lakeland. And so I think primarily, my job is\ngoing to be those three components while also touching our customers and touching our people\nand making sure that we're all rowing in the same direction. But I'm very pleased with the\ndevelopment of our current leadership team, the responsibilities they've taken on, the resiliency\nof the entire organization to some of the changes that have occurred and I'm energized by it. It's a\nlittle test 12:00 a.m. here in Hong Kong, and I feel like it's midday.\nQ: I would never have guessed that you're in Hong Kong. Good connection, and you sound\ngreat. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe we can touch upon line drive. I spoke with you about it early\nin May when you first initiated or announced the agreement. But it certainly seems like an\ninteresting way of adding additional marketing capacity and growth to the organization. And --\nmaybe you can just give a brief highlight. If my memory serves correct, LineDrive adds maybe\nsome depth or ability to open the right doors to the right people in the right order to really drive\nsome additional growth. But just curious if maybe you can give a little bit of an update on that or\neven some background and where it's going?\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nSo we've -- this was the week for training for LineDrive. So many of our product management\nand sort of product evangelists were in Chicago meeting with LineDrive to help roll that out. I\nthink all indications were that, that went very well. It will take some time to gain some traction\non that, but we're very pleased with the homework we've done on LineDrive. We spent consumer\namount of time talking to their current customers, and we're pleased to hear what we were\nhearing from them.\nAnd frankly, I think to your point, it gets 35 or so additional feet on the street to get the Lakeland\nmessage out to a level of -- a high level of national account type distributors that we see a strong\nability to leverage our brand.\nQ: Got it. And then maybe. Yes, Roger, sorry. Yes.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nWe have a lot of confidence in our sales force. We do have a strong sales team and we're clicking\non a lot of cylinders. But what LineDrive brings, like Jim said, is just a vastly enhanced level of\naccess to about 30, 35 large national accounts where LineDrive is already representing some of\nthe top names that you would recognize in MRO across other verticals. So they take just one\nvertical. We'll be the only industrial PPE provider in their portfolio, but there are other very\nprominent names that you'd recognize that they go into these national accounts with and very\ncompelling thing to the value proposition is they have the relationships, not just in the field and\nin the regions, but in the headquarters of these large national accounts and some of them have\neven come from those accounts.\nThey know the right people to talk to. And what's -- I just kind of mentioned that the way we get\nthis opportunity is that a large competitor of ours that you might know and then you might\nTranscript Provided by\nrecognize decided to pull out of that relationship, and it opened a fantastic door for us, and we're\nseeing promising leads already.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYes. So Jerry, to add that one last thing to add to that, and that is that because of -- as Roger\nalluded to the talent that we have in our current sales group, it's not like we're excluding entirely\nany of these relationships. We have several hybrid models where we have guys who have strong\nrelationships with these distributors and their sort of joint venturing the relationship with\nLineDrive, and we see that as a critical enhancement as well.\nQ: Got it. Maybe one more question in this maybe might -- I'm sorry, apologies. It may be more\nfor Roger, but you highlighted operating margins down slightly year-over-year. Obviously,\nthere's some noise in there. I think there was some legal costs and you mentioned something else.\nBut where does that go from here? I mean we can -- I certainly understand exiting out the legal\ncosts, but I'm just curious if there's a little bit more fine-tuning on some of the acquisitions to\ndrive out costs or everything is aligned and you just grow into some of those costs that you have\nacquired?\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nNo. I think there absolutely is, and there will be additional costs that we drive out. We\nhighlighted the acquired CapEx, and that's shown as one of the bridge items in our presentation.\nAnd we just brought those companies on, we talked about in the past that we like companies that\nhave strong internal talent, we tend to run on a regionalized basis.\nSo the company and the -- workforce comes over. But we're really digging in that beginning now\nbeginning this quarter to look at not just their expenses, and we have identified some things that\nare no longer needed as a stand-alone company on their part, but also to continue to work ours.\nAnd I'm still not happy with the level of expense in some areas of ours is not -- it's kind of more\nrelated to third-party and professional expenses and things that we're going to look at on that\nfront.\nAnd like we noted, there -- the transaction expenses, a lot of those did flow through this quarter,\nand we'll continue to have that until we close LHD. And that will be a regular thing as we do\nother acquisitions. There are some expenses related to the Monterrey, Mexico situation that\nthey're being carved out until we get that resolved. And as you'd expect, with acquisitions like\nthis, depreciation and amortization goes up through the purchase accounting mechanism. So\nshort answer is, it's not surprising. We're not -- I'm not happy with where it is, and we're going to\ncontinue to press that and work with not just our duly acquired entities, but our -- all of our\nregions and teams in the field and in corporate to improve that.\nQ: Okay. Perfect. I'll jump back in queue. I don't want to monopolize it. So thank you guys and\nsafe travel, Jim.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Matthew Galinko with Maxim Group.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nHey Matt.\nQ: Hey, good afternoon or I guess good morning. I don't think where you are. Thank you for\ntaking my questions. So I did notice that it was, I think, the first quarter of year-over-year\ndisposables growth in a while. So I wanted -- I was hoping you could maybe comment on that a\nlittle bit more. We specific to your kind of working on shoring up go-to-market there? Or was\nthere just something anomalous in the quarter? And then generally, how should we think about\nthe disposal trajectory moving through this year and what sort of implied in your organic\nexpectations for this year?\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYes. Matt, it's Roger. I'll jump on that first and let Jim follow on. There's again, there's some\ninteresting dynamics at play there. And as we went through our strategic planning last summer\nand last fall, we really identified not just that fire service was a strong growth priority for us. But\nalso we've got a fantastic disposables and PPE brand. In most places in North America, we've got\n20% to 35% of the market there. And I think we follow in the sort a little bit, I think we caused\nsome confusion maybe with some customers and with our sales team about two years ago when\nwe kind of started talking about commodity versus strategic. And that was a mixed message that\nthis kind of new management team has worked to change because that is very strong and\nimportant part of our portfolio.\nSo on one hand, we are still seeing weakness in Europe. We're going to address that. China,\nwe've talked about we've addressed that. But we've got, we're very pleased with our sales efforts\nin the Americas, North America, South America. And again, this is even before LineDrive\nrelationship has really taken hold at all. So things like critical environment, we're seeing growth\nthere. We continue to make inroads on the high-performance FR/AR.\nThe chemical, we saw it turn up our team in Latin America, South America is just doing a\ntremendous job growing that business there. So we think we've cleaned up our message on what\ndisposables are. It is, as Jim described very well. It is a very good cash flowing business for us.\nWe own our manufacturing and we do a very good job of it. We've got a great brand there. And\nour test is just going to be to get Europe and Asia back move in the right direction, and we'll be\nvery pleased.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nYes. I would echo a lot of what Roger said, and I would sort of pile on a little bit on Latin\nAmerica. Obviously, there's currency issues that we've had there in the past. But it's a developing\nmarket. There's a lot of activity in the spaces where we provide sort of the industrial disposables\nopportunities. So -- and we're becoming rapidly a growing leader in that market. We obviously\nhave some price pressures in places like Europe and China. And we're hopeful that we spend a\nlot of time educating our sales teams in those markets and showing them how we want us to be\nsort of a differentiator in partnering with some of our larger customers and distributors.\nAnd layer on top of that, I think the pending opportunity to have a sales leader here seeing. I'm\nvery optimistic about where we're going here.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYes. And Matt, just one thing, the last thing I'd point out there as well as you've seen our -- I\nhaven't had a question on this, but you've seen our gross margins go up. And it's not just the --\nnot just the fire, although that is driving a lot of it. But even on the acquired companies, the gross\nmargins at those companies, as we've talked about before, tend to actually be a little bit lower.\nBut the programs that we have, some manufacturing efficiencies that we've gotten in place that\nwe continue to work on. So that really is a business that we like and that we're continuing to\nfocus on very intently.\nQ: Got it. Thank you. And I guess just a follow-up on the guidance. I know you're not going to\nget too granular, but I think you mentioned around a 9% organic growth rate for the rest of the\nyear. I think it was maybe around 11% in the first quarter. But I'm just curious, particularly\naround fire, what's a reasonable organic growth rate we should be thinking about for this year?\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThat's a good question. And like you said, it's -- we're thinking about it really more as a whole.\nAnd one of the reasons that it's kind of hard to kind of peel out the organic, and this is -- this\nactually -- I mean, it's a great point that you raised because I can address something else there.\nOne of the reasons that we're not really going to get into say, what's the EBITDA, for example, at\na Jolly or Pacific is the cross-selling. So they would have had EBITDA of X or Y as a stand-\nalone company.\nNow they're part of Lakeland and we're selling into the U.S. now and not just in the U.S., but\neven through Eagle channels, and through other sales operations that we have, we changed the --\nnot to get technical on it, but change the transfer pricing between that entity then into the U.S. or\nto Europe or what have you. So what their EBITDA would have been, it's just a stand-alone will\nbe very different than what it is into selling into the U.S. or into -- through the Eagle channels.\nSo it makes it a little tougher to say, what's the organic because now we're selling those products\nthrough the U.S.. So really, when you say what's the organic fire for Lakeland. Really, you're just\ntalking about the Lakeland and Eagle turnout suits, which I think is missing a lot of the picture\nbecause the value proposition, as we've talked about, is the full head to toe kit.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Yes. Fair points. And I appreciate that. Maybe a final question for me and then I'll jump back\nin the queue. Anything else you could add on for investors regarding the LHD acquisition and\nthe timing. Should we be confident that kind of the final hurdles are relatively surmountable -- or\nshould we be thinking of it as something that could slip further out of the first half? How should\nwe be framing that?\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nMatt, I guess I'll start with that. And M&A is an iterative process. And I have strong belief that\nthis deal is going to get done. But when you've got between regulators and third parties,\nsometimes it's like herding cats. So I wouldn't be here in Hong Kong, if I didn't think this deal\nwas going to close. But stranger things have happened, but that's not -- I'm not suggesting that --\nI mean I don't do odds anymore on these kinds of things, but I can tell you I'm highly confident\nat this point because I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYes. I mean, like we mentioned in our comments, we are very close, we believe.\nQ: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the\nfloor back to Jim for closing remarks.\nJames Jenkins - President and Chief Executive Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your continued\ninterest in Lakeland. We look forward to building on the strong momentum Lakeland has and\nsharing our success with you in fiscal 2025. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you\nfor your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"

Mr. Jenkins, the\nfloor is yours.\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter fiscal\nTranscript Provided by\n2024 earnings call. First, I would like to start by thanking customers and distributor partners\naround the world for trusting us with your lives and safety. Our mission at Lakeland is to protect\nthe world’s workers, first responders, and communities by providing quality protective solutions\nfor the most critical situations. Our customers are heroes, and we never take that trust for\ngranted. I also want to thank our Lakeland team members across the company for their continued\ncommitment and enthusiasm as we further deliver on our strategic initiatives this quarter.\nOur fiscal fourth quarter and our activities since January 31st have been very exciting and\neventful as we continue to execute our previously communicated strategies and position\nLakeland for profitable growth into the future. I appreciate all the hard work put in by our\ndedicated team. We will talk more about those results and initiatives during this call.\nOur fiscal year 2024 was a good year for Lakeland, but also a year of great change. We are\nexcited about the progress we are making and the work that lies ahead as we take Lakeland to\nnew heights. Before beginning my comments about the business, I’d like to provide a brief\nupdate on our ongoing CEO search. Our board has been methodical and deliberate in its vetting\nand selection process for a leader, who will continue to drive our business strategy and culture.\nLakeland has a solid foundation in place with exciting runway for growth, and the board and I\nexpect to be in a position to make an announcement in our second fiscal quarter.\nAs we discussed in our previous call, our team is doing an excellent job of executing our\nstrategic plan of creating high-performance culture driven by our corporate values. We are\ninvesting resources in high growth geographies and product segments, including building a\npremier global fire brand through product and marketing enhancements. We are also working to\ndrive profitable growth in our other strategic product lines through product development,\nstrategic pricing, channel diversification, and operations optimization.\nFinally, as we will discuss more, we are acquiring companies that improves Lakeland’s\ncompetitive advantage in focused markets. On that front, we took a significant leap forward with\nthe completion of our Pacific Helmets acquisition, which closed in Q4, and Jolly Scarpe boots,\nwhich closed in early February. We also recently announced the signing of an agreement to\nacquire LHD Group of Germany’s fire service business, which we expect to close in late May\n2024.\nAlong with our Pacific Helmets acquisition, the Jolly acquisition completes Lakeland’s “head-to-\ntoe” fire product offering, strengthens our geographic diversity, and presents exciting cross-\nselling opportunities with global certifications across Lakeland’s existing sales and distribution\nchannels. Jolly Scarpe manufactures and sells a premium boots product line with a global\nreputation for safety, design and innovation, and we are excited to add their products to the\nLakeland family.\nLHD’s fire and rescue offerings give us another premium product portfolio for fire services that\ncomplements our Eagle Technical Products and new Pacific and Jolly offerings. Additionally,\nthe LHD Care service offerings provide us with attractive recurring revenue streams and gross\nmargins that Lakeland will work to leverage and expand. These acquisitions reflect our\nTranscript Provided by\ncommitment to executing and accelerating the pace of small, strategic, and quick M&A strategy,\nSSQ.\nWe still have a very attractive SSQ acquisitions pipeline, and we continue to search for\nopportunities that further position Lakeland to execute our broad growth strategies. We expect to\ncontinue investing strategically to broaden and diversify Lakeland’s range of products and end\nmarkets. I trust everyone has had the opportunity to review the press release, Q4 and full year\nearnings deck we published last evening. I encourage you to follow along in the earnings\npresentation as Roger and I review our results.\nLooking at our fourth quarter and full year results, our net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2024 increased by 7.7% to $31.2 million compared to $29 million in the previous year. For the\nfull fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Lakeland delivered solid revenue growth of $11.8\nmillion, or 10.5%, compared to last year, despite a 44% decrease in our Asia business during the\nyear, and a weaker than expected fourth quarter. We were very pleased with the growth in our\nU.S. and Latin American operations this fiscal year, as these important geographies grew 13%\nand 49% year-over-year.\nOur fire service business continues to deepen and broaden, having grown over 80% versus last\nfiscal year, driven by our strategic acquisitions, superior lead times from our manufacturing\npipeline, and onboarding successes with new distributors. Our Eagle Technical Products business\nalso had a very good year, with growth of over 103% since being acquired by Lakeland.\nIn terms of profitability, our fourth quarter gross margin came in at 44.6%, excluding the effect\nof a one-time charge for inventory rightsizing in our adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million,\nexcluding the negative impact of foreign exchange losses, both of which Roger will discuss in\nmore detail later. Adjusted for the impact of negative FX in the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA\nwould have been approximately 11% versus 6.7% last year. Our gross margins and adjusted\nEBITDA for the quarter benefited from the improving sales mix of our higher value strategic\nproducts and improvements in our logistics and shipping operations.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, our revenue increased by almost $12 million or 10.5% against last\nyear. This includes an 80% year-over-year growth in our fire services business, $8.3 million or\n7.4% of our fiscal year 2024 growth came from our strategic acquisitions, while our organic\nbusiness grew by $3.6 million or 3.2%. This despite a 44% year-over-year decline in our Asia\nbusiness.\nAs I mentioned previously, our Latin American businesses also experienced significant growth,\nup 49% year-over-year. We experienced foreign exchange volatility from a significant\ndevaluation in the Argentinian peso this year, but we believe that the country is making\nimprovements in physical stability. We are very optimistic about Latin America where we\ncontinue to invest and take market share.\nFrom an earnings perspective, our fiscal year 2024 net income increased by $3.6 million to $5.4\nmillion, resulting in net income per diluted share of $0.72 compared to $0.24 in the prior year,\ndespite the previously mentioned inventory adjustment and FX loss. Our adjusted EBITDA\nTranscript Provided by\nexcluding FX loss increased by over $6 million to $15.7 million in fiscal year 2024, resulting in\nan adjusted EBITDA margin excluding FX of 12.6%.\nIn line with our growth trajectory, and to further support our global portfolio of premium safety\nbrands, we are gearing up to hire a new Senior Vice President of Sales this summer.\nAdditionally, we anticipate expanding our integration team to drive operational excellence across\nthe organization. Our commitment remains unwavering and I’m excited to see where this coming\nyear takes us.\nFrom here, I’d like to pass it over to Roger to cover more of the financial results for you and\nprovide an outlook for the coming year.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nThanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. First covering the current period, Lakeland delivered sales of\n$31.2 million in the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2024. As noted in our earnings press\nrelease yesterday afternoon, we delivered solid year-over-year sales growth. Domestic sales were\n$12.7 million, or 40.6% of the total revenues. And international sales were $18.5 million, or\n59.4% of total revenues. This compares with domestic sales of $11.8 million, or 40.8% of the\ntotal, and international sales of $18.2 million, or 59.2%, of the total in the fourth quarter of the\nprevious year. While our geographic mix was relatively unchanged year-over-year, both our\ndomestic and international sales grew even with the 44% year-over-year decline in Asia.\nIn terms of product mix for the fourth quarter, our fire service category continues to increase\nwith an 18% year-over-year growth. Disposables continued to decrease as a percentage of\nLakeland sales and represent 41% of total revenues compared to 48% in the year ago period.\nThis is a result of growth in our fire services and high-performance categories and the continued\nweakness in the disposables product line in Asia.\nAs we discussed in the previous quarter, we do see excellent opportunities in both our\ndisposables and woven product categories. We’re having great success with our North American\ndirect container program, as well as with our oil and gas turnaround business, which continued\ninto the fourth quarter. We’re also very optimistic about our critical environment opportunities as\nour excellent sales team continues to identify and close new opportunities.\nAdditionally, we are taking steps to bolster our North American industrial sales channels, which\nwe will have more to discuss later in the year. As Jim mentioned, revenue for the full fiscal year\n2024 increased by almost $12 million or 10.5% versus last year. For the fiscal year, our fire\nservice business is 21.3% of sales and disposables are 39.8%.\nOn Slide 11 of our earnings presentation, we provide a comparison of our FY 2024 geographic\nand product line revenue versus FY 2023, as well as a pro forma depiction of our geographic and\nproduct revenue assuming we had owned Pacific Helmets, Jolly Boots, and LHD fire and rescue\nfor the full year FY 2024.\nOn a full year pro forma basis with these acquisitions, our fire service business increases to 42%\nof revenue, the largest category, followed by disposables at 29%, chemical at 13%, and high\nTranscript Provided by\nperformance at 12%. Our U.S. revenue percentages go to 32%, and Europe expands to 23%, led\nby Jolly and LHD.\nReported gross profit was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $0.3\nmillion or 3.2% compared to $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Our reported\ngross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared\nto 37.5% for the fourth quarter of last year. Versus the previous year, our gross profit margin was\nhelped by a 3.7 percentage point improvement in sales mix from higher value products and a\n3.4% margin benefit and improvements from freight costs as we show on Slide 7.\nAs Jim mentioned, gross profit performance in the current period was negatively impacted by a\none-time excess and obsolete inventory adjustment of $2.7 million. Excluding the inventory\nadjustment, the fourth quarter gross profit would have been 44.6%.\nAs we discussed in prior quarters, we were not pleased with the level of inventory the company\nwas carrying coming into fiscal 2024. We took strong steps to reduce it: First, by implementing\nbetter planning and operational improvements, led by our new Chief Operating Officer, Helena\nAn, and by working with sales on customer incentives for excess and reserved inventory. Those\ninitiatives were quite successful during the fiscal year, particularly in the third quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we made a decision to clean up obsolete styles and non-strategic\nproducts, resulting in a $2.7 million one-time charge for inventory right sizing. We believe our\ninventory position going into fiscal year 2025 is much more aligned with the strategic focus of\nour business. As a reminder, fire services products are made to order, which is positive for our\ninventory and working capital positions.\nLakeland reported an operating loss of $3.3 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024\ncompared to an operating profit of $100,000 for the fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The main\ndrivers for the difference between the two periods were the previously mentioned $2.7 million\none-time inventory adjustment, and a $1.7 million negative impact on operating expenses caused\nby the currency fluctuations, primarily the devaluation of the Argentine peso.\nAdditionally, higher SG&A costs, including non-recurring acquisition, severance and\nrestructuring costs, higher selling expenses from sales growth, acquired company operating\nexpenses, and higher bonus expenses negatively affected SG&A and operating profit in the\nfourth quarter.\nOperating margins were minus 10.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 0.3% for\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the negative impacts of the inventory adjustment,\nforeign exchange, severance and acquisition expenses, our operating profit would have been $2.3\nmillion or a 7.5% operating margin for the quarter.\nThe company reported a net loss of $1 million or $0.13 per basic share and $0.13 per diluted\nshare compared to net income of $200,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share last year. Net\nincome was positively impacted by a $3.8 million gain from the sale of our Canada warehouse in\nQ4 of 2024 and negatively impacted by an increased tax expense for the quarter, primarily driven\nTranscript Provided by\nby international jurisdictions, including the sale of our Canadian warehouse, in addition to the\npreviously discussed inventory adjustment and FX losses.\nAdjusted EBITDA excluding FX losses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $3.4 million, or\na margin of 11% compared to $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Foreign currency\nlosses of $1.7 million negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA, resulting in an as reported adjusted\nEBITDA of $1.8 million.\nAs shown on Slide 7, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter benefited from improvements in our\nhigher value product sales mix and lower freight expense, partially offset by higher selling\nexpenses related to sales growth and acquired entity OpEx, higher professional fees and higher\nbonus expense, in addition to the previously mentioned foreign exchange impact.\nAs we show on Slides 8 and 9, for the full year fiscal 2024, Lakeland’s adjusted EBITDA\nexcluding FX of $15.7 million is an increase of 64% versus FY 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $10.7\nmillion. Full year FX fluctuations primarily from the Argentine peso reduced FY 2024 adjusted\nEBITDA by $3.7 million, while sales mix and improved freight and logistics bolstered adjusted\nEBITDA versus last year.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Lakeland ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of\napproximately $25.2 million compared to our prior year ended cash balance of $24.6 million.\nOur focus on working capital improvements resulted in $3.2 million of cash flow from\noperations during the fourth quarter, $2.8 million of which was driven by accelerated reduction\nof raw and finished goods inventory.\nIn FY 2024, we produced a positive operating cash flow of $10.9 million, led by decreases in\ninventory of $7.7 million to a level of $51.3 million of inventory at January 31, 2024, along with\nimproved gross margins. Our laser focus on cash further strengthens the company’s financial\nposition, particularly our robust balance sheet and cash position, which we believe will allow us\nto continue pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities.\nAt January 31, 2024, the company had $1 million of debt outstanding at a foreign subsidiary. As\nwe mentioned in our press release, in early February, we drew down a portion of our revolving\nline of credit in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Jolly Scarpe. In addition, on\nMarch 28 of 2024, we completed an amendment to our existing revolver to extend the facility for\n5 years and to expand our line of credit availability to $40 million, up from $25 million\npreviously with improved terms.\nCapital expenditures for the 3 months ended January 31, 2024, were $0.6 million and $2.1\nmillion for the fiscal year 2024. We expect FY 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately $3\nmillion as we develop additional in-house fire service manufacturing capacity and replace\nexisting equipment in the normal course of operations. Monterey expansion, which we discussed\nlast quarter, remains on pause as we continue to assess weather-related damage to our leased\nbuilding.\nTranscript Provided by\nFinally, I’m very pleased to report that we continue making significant enhancements in the skill\nset and capabilities of our global finance and accounting teams and we will continue to invest in\nour global finance and IT systems. This becomes even more important as we continue to expand\nglobally. I’m particularly happy to report that we’ve made significant improvements in our\nglobal control environment, and we were able to quickly remediate and remove the control\nmaterial weakness that was identified at the end of fiscal 2023.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, we are very pleased that for the first time Lakeland is providing\nforward-looking guidance for our fiscal 2025 fiscal year. Please note that these expectations\ninclude the recently announced Jolly Scarpe and Pacific Helmets acquisitions that do not include\nthe LHD fire business, which we expect to close in late May 2024. We are becoming more\nconfident in our global sales platforms and earnings ability, and we see FY 2025 revenue in the\nrange of $140 million to $150 million.\nAdditionally, we expect FY 2025 adjusted EBITDA excluding FX to be in the range of $16.8\nmillion to $18.5 million. We expect to update these expectations once we close the LHD\ntransaction and as fiscal 2025 progresses.\nWith that overview, I’d like to turn the call back over to Jim, before we begin taking questions.\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nThank you, Roger. Let me wrap up by taking a few minutes to talk about our ongoing strategy to\nemphasize the opportunities we see for our business. Our value proposition continues to be\nstrong and unique, and we believe it will resonate in the market. We also believe our growing\nportfolio of product offerings in the fire space, which will soon offer total care complementary\nservice with our acquisition of LHD, coupled with our growing ability to effectively leverage our\nother brands in areas of the world like Latin America, where we once had little presence should\nhelp drive more consistent performance over the long-term.\nBut we think there’s a real opportunity to get even better and to take more market share. We also\nsee an opportunity on the system side, which is being addressed with a concentrated effort over\nthe next couple of years to upgrade our systems and software and to drive technology as a\ncompetitive advantage. This is a longer-term play. As I said on our last call, we are still in the\nvery early innings of a nine-inning game. Over time, we expect these investments to drive more\nproductivity and efficiency. While it will not happen overnight, our confidence is high that we\nwill see the anticipated mid- to longer-term productivity improvements and associated EBITDA\nmargin expansion.\nFrom an acquisition strategy perspective, the fire market continues to be fragmented. And\nacquisitions, both making them and driving organic growth after the acquisition is completed,\nwill be an important element of our growth strategy. Our acquisition plan is supported by healthy\ncash flow. We will make concerted efforts to expand our integration programs as we add\nexpertise to effectively consolidate our growing fire services offerings.\nTranscript Provided by\nOur acquisition plan is both disciplined and strategic, and we believe we are the only company in\nour space actively acquiring with the end goal of comprehensive integration. We want to\ncontinue focusing on the smaller companies as we believe the integration process to be less\ndisruptive as exhibited by our success this year with Eagle. We see us replicating the Eagle\nmodel with Pacific Helmets, Jolly and LHD. That means we will drive to execute the sales and\ncost synergies from the acquisitions, while maintaining the brand value and key contributors\nfrom the companies we acquire. We believe that is unique in the market.\nI’ll conclude by saying that the pipelines associated with both our organic and acquisitive growth\nare very strong. And we remain confident in our direction and believe we will continue to be\nwell positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We also expect to be able to\ncontinue to generate positive short-term results simultaneously to better position the company for\nthe longer term.\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator\nInstructions] Your first question for today is from Gerry Sweeney with Roth MKM.\nQ: Good morning, guys. This is Brandon Rogers on for Gerry Sweeney. Thanks for taking my\nquestion.\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nHey, good morning, Brandon.\nQ: How’s it going? So, I understand that there’s a company-wide focus on growing the service\naspects for both fire and the core business as well. How much of the current business has a\nservice component? And then, will the service component growth come organically or\ninorganically or both?\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nSo on the service end, this is our first foray into the service throughout the LHD acquisition. So\nwe do not have that offering, but we’re very excited about it. We’ve got a team sort of exploring\nwhether that’s something we might greenfield in other areas of the world. But, right now, I think\nwe’re going to spend a good chunk of this year learning from LHD and how that process has\nworked with that service component.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nAnd Brandon, it’s Roger, I’ll just add that, that’s something that we have talked about, we’ve\nbeen looking for an opportunity and the fact that LHD has such a strong, what they call, LHD\nCare program in number of countries. I think that gives us the leg up. And also we’ll have more\ninformation following acquisition, but the gross margins for that business, as you can expect, are\nwell above company averages.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Awesome. Thank you for that. And then another one. Can you provide just some of the\ndetails around like the value proposition and the important benefits of providing the “head-to-\ntoe” fire product offering?\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nWell, when you think about it, a lot of these are tenders, right? So they’ve got in various\ncountries certain opportunities to win the entire bid. And having that “head-to-toe” offering\nrather than having to find a partner to join in the bid, we believe provides us with a significant\ncompetitive advantage.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nYeah, we mentioned this at your conference recently. I mean, we’ve got very recent anecdotal\nevidence of that. We had a significant bid in LatAm going up against much larger fire turnout\ngear providers. And the fact that we were able to come to the tender with the Pacific Helmets and\nJolly Boots resulted in us winning that tender which was very exciting.\nQ: Thank you. And then one more for me is just on FX. I know FX had a much more significant\nimpact this year compared to last year. And is that strictly due to the devaluation of the\nArgentinian peso or were there other aspects at play that had a material impact?\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nYeah. So this is a great question. The FX that we called out was due almost exclusively to the\nArgentinian peso. So if you think about how FX impacts a global company, and we are\nincredibly global at this point. It can go through the balance sheet translation through OCI, it can\ncertainly affect the top-line revenue number depending on one currency versus another. That’s\nnot what we’re talking about here, and that’s just normal part of doing business.\nThe Argentinian situation arises; it’s got a couple of distinct features. One, it arises because of\nthe current high inflation rate in Argentina being above 100%, U.S. GAAP requires us to carry\nthat operating entity in a U.S. dollar functional currency, not a local currency. What that results\nin is, when we re-measure our assets, particularly cash and receivables that currency impact\nflows through OpEx. So not only was it a headwind, it’s a headwind and what I’d refer to as a\nbad place and that’s OpEx.\nThat said, we do see the situation improving there. There are steps being taken to get their fiscal\nhouse much more in order. We are comprehensively reevaluating and looking at all of our\nfunctional currency designations and we’ll manage that as best we can. But the reason that we\ncalled that one out is, in addition to where it flows through OpEx, it was kind of compounded by\nthe fact that there’s unlike most currencies, there’s nothing you can do about it to hedge it. It just\nwas not hedgeable.\nThat said, like Jim said, we were very bullish on that market. We are taking market share. It is\nprofitable and it’s growing, and we are going to continue to invest in the Latin American market.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Thank you both. I appreciate you taking the questions. I can take the rest offline.\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you.\nRoger Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Lakeland Industries, Inc.\nOkay. Great.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no other questions in the queue.\nJames Jenkins - Acting President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman,\nLakeland Industries, Inc.\nThank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us on today’s call. We appreciate your continuous\ninterest in Lakeland. We look forward to building on the strong momentum Lakeland has and\nsharing our successes with you in fiscal 2025. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today’s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you\nfor your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"
