Announces Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results\n\n###### NEWS\n\nNEW YORK, November 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Bit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT) (the “Company”), a global platform for high-performance computing (“HPC”) infrastructure and digital asset production headquartered in New York, today announced its unaudited financial results for the Third Quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2024**\n\n  * Total revenue was $22.7 million for the Third Quarter of 2024, a 96% increase compared to the Third Quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the commencement of our high performance computing services (“HPC”) business.\n  * Revenue from bitcoin mining was $10.1 million for the Third Quarter of 2024, an 11% decrease compared to the prior year’s quarter. The Company’s HPC recognized $12.2 million of revenue during the quarter compared to nil the prior year.\n  * The Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $105.6 million, and total liquidity (defined as cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, USDC, and the fair market value of digital assets) of approximately $223.6 million[1](javascript:void\\(0\\))1 This figure excludes digital assets invested in an internally managed fund., as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Total assets were $376.0 million and Shareholders’ Equity amounted to $315.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA[2](javascript:void\\(0\\))2 Adjusted EBITDA refers to earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense (“EBITDA”) adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and / or non-recurring items. See disclosure about Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 25 below. was $(21.8) million for the Third Quarter of 2024 compared to $(2.9) million for the Third Quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA includes a $21.9 million unrealized loss on digital assets.\n  * GAAP loss per share was $0.26 on a fully diluted basis for the Third Quarter of 2024 compared to a loss per share of $0.08 for the Third Quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Operational Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024**\n\n  * The Company earned 165.4 bitcoins during the Third Quarter of 2024, a 59% decrease from the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a reduction in block rewards following the halving event in April 2024 and by an increase in network difficulty, and partially offset by a 104% increase in the Company’s operational hash rate.\n  * The Company paid approximately $0.057 per kilowatt hour to its hosting partners for electricity consumed during the Third Quarter of 2024.\n  * The average fleet efficiency for the active fleet was approximately 27.8 J/TH as of September 30, 2024.\n  * The Company earned 161.9 ETH from native staking in the Third Quarter of 2024.\n  * Treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 731.1 and 27,388.1, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $46.3 million and $71.3 million on September 30, 2024, respectively.\n  * The BTC equivalent[3](javascript:void\\(0\\))3 “BTC equivalent” is a hypothetical illustration of the value of our digital asset portfolio in bitcoin terms. BTC equivalent is defined as if all non-BTC digital assets, comprised of ETH and USDC, were converted into BTC as of June 30, 2024, and added to our existing BTC balance. Conversion values are found using the closing price on coinmarketcap.com. of our digital asset holdings as of September 30, 2024 (defined as if all ETH and USDC holdings were converted into BTC as of that date) was approximately 1,863 BTC[4](javascript:void\\(0\\))1 This figure excludes digital assets invested in an internally managed fund., or approximately $118.0 million.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, we had 50,044 miners owned or operating (in Iceland) for bitcoin mining with a total maximum hash rate of 4.3 EH/s.\n  * The Company’s active hash rate of its bitcoin mining fleet was approximately 2.4 EH/s as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Approximately 88% of our fleet’s run-rate electricity consumption was generated from carbon-free energy sources as of September 30, 2024. These figures are based on data provided by our hosts, publicly available sources, and internal estimates, demonstrating our commitment to sustainable practices in the digital asset mining industry.\n  * The Company had approximately 21,568 ETH actively staked in native staking protocols as of September 30, 2024.\n  * On August 19, 2024, Bit Digital announced that it had signed a binding term sheet with Boosteroid Inc. (“Boosteroid”), the world’s third-largest cloud gaming provider. Upon signing a Master Service and Lease Agreement (“MSA”), Boosteroid will place an initial purchase for a starting quantity of GPU servers with a five-year service duration. Bit Digital will provide Boosteroid with options to draw down additional servers in multiples of 100, up to a total of 50,000 GPU servers within five years after signing the MSA, depending on their deployment plans and subject to market conditions. The entire 50,000 GPU deployment represents an aggregate revenue opportunity to Bit Digital in excess of $700 million over the five-year term. Bit Digital announced it had executed the MSA with Boosteroid on November 4, 2024. The Company finalized an initial purchase order with Boosteroid for a starting quantity of 300 GPUs that are expected to generate approximately $4.6 million of revenue over the five-year term. The Company anticipates additional deployments through the end of 2024 and throughout 2025.\n  * September 5, 2024, the Company received a 90-days notice of non-renewal of colocation mining services agreement from Coinmint, which informed the Company of its intent not to renew 27 MW of the 36 MW total contracted capacity at its Massena, New York site, effective December 7, 2024. Subsequently, on October 29, 2024, the Company received an additional 90-days notice of non-renewal of colocation mining services agreement from Coinmint, which informed the Company of its intent to not renew the remaining 9 MW of the 36 MW total contracted capacity at its Massena, New York site, effective January 28, 2024. Following the termination, Coinmint will continue to provide approximately 10 MW of capacity at their Plattsburgh, New York facility. As of September 30, 2024, Coinmint provided approximately 46.0 MW of capacity for our miners at their facilities. The Company is currently assessing options for replacing this capacity and plans to high-grade the portion of its fleet composed of older generation miners hosted at the Coinmint locations.\n\n\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\n  * On October 14, 2024, Bit Digital announced the acquisition of Enovum Data Centers (“Enovum”) for a total consideration of CAD $62.8MM (approximately USD $46MM based on a CAD/USD exchange rate of 0.73). The acquisition was completed on a debt-free basis, with a normalized level of working capital acquired, funded by approximately CAD $56 million of cash and approximately 1.62 million share equivalents issued solely to key management who rolled-over a significant portion of their existing ownership in Enovum. The transaction closed on October 11, 2024. The acquisition vertically integrated Bit Digital’s HPC operations with a 4MW Tier 3 datacenter in Montreal that is fully leased to a plurality of colocation customers. It also provided Bit Digital with an expansion pipeline of over 280MW and an experienced team to lead the development process. Immediate term plans include bringing approximately 8MW online by the end of 2Q 2025 for approximately USD $50MM of capex. The Company expects run-rate, colocation EBITDA for the Enovum business to exit 2Q25 at approximately USD $13MM based on that development schedule. Bit Digital may also place its own GPUs at those sites, which could significantly increase EBITDA per MW. The Company is tentatively planning to bring an additional 20MW online by year-end 2025. However, development plans will be contingent on firm customer demand and financing options.\n  * In October 2024, Bit Digital purchased 42 H200 GPU servers (336 GPUs) for approximately $9.7 million. Those servers were subsequently deployed in Iceland for internal purposes and future client deployments.\n  * On November 14, 2024, Bit Digital executed term sheets with two new customers. The first deal provides for Bit Digital to supply the customer with 512 H200 GPUs for a period of at least six months, representing an approximate $5.0 million contract value for Bit Digital over the initial six-month term. The MSA has been executed with this client and an initial two server purchase order has been fulfilled and revenue generation has begun on those units. The remainder of the deployment is expected prior to year-end 2024. Under the second deal, Bit Digital will supply a separate customer with 576 H200 GPUs for a twelve-month period, representing a total contract value of approximately $10.1 million over the term. The Company will provide additional details on the deployment schedule upon the execution of MSAs and purchase orders.\n  * On November 14, 2024, Bit Digital executed an MSA with a new customer. The contract provides for 64 H200 GPUs on a month-to-month basis. The contract represents annual revenue of approximately $1.2 million. The deployment commenced and began revenue generation on November 15, 2024. Bit Digital fulfilled the deployment using on-hand inventory of H200 GPUs.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The maturation of our HPC business was a defining theme this quarter. We expanded our GPU cloud client base with the addition of Boosteroid and strengthened our team with critical hires, including a new CTO, Head of Revenue, and key talent in sales and engineering. In October, we closed the acquisition of Enovum, further enhancing our HPC capabilities and positioning us to scale quickly to meet growing demand. We believe these investments lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth and set the stage for a robust future.\n\nOur mining business faced anticipated headwinds during the first full quarter post-April halving. Record-low hash prices and seasonal electricity rate increases resulted in compressed mining margins. We intentionally refrained from capital investments to upgrade our fleet to date in 2024, and the impact from legacy miners operating during the third quarter was a drag on our results. The upcoming conclusion of a hosting contract, along with legacy mining rigs at that site, presents an ideal opportunity to replace older units with newer models to reduce our production costs. While we will continue to evaluate mining investment on a case-by-case basis, our primary focus remains on scaling our HPC business, which we believe offers the greatest potential for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are committed to expanding our client base, growing our data center footprint, and developing a comprehensive software stack to enhance customer acquisition, retention, and margin growth. We are confident that this strategy will drive sustained value and better serve our long-term goals compared to short-term hash rate growth. With these strategic moves, we are more confident than ever in our direction and excited for the transformative growth that lies ahead. We continue to expect to reach our $100 million run-rate revenue target for our HPC business by the end of 2024.”\n\n**About Bit Digital**\n\nBit Digital, Inc. is a global platform for high-performance computing (“HPC”) infrastructure and digital asset production headquartered in New York City .

Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under “Risk Factors” in Item 3.D of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“Annual Report”). Notwithstanding the fact that Bit Digital Inc. has not conducted operations in the PRC since September 30, 2021 we have previously disclosed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report: “We may be subject to fines and penalties for any noncompliance with or any liabilities in our former business in China in a certain period from now on.” Although the statute of limitations for non-compliance by our former business in the PRC is generally two years and the Company has been out of the PRC, for more than two years, the Authority may still find its prior bitcoin mining operations involved a threat to financial security. In such event, the two-year period would be extended to five years. If any material risk was to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or bitcoin hash rate may also materially affect the future performance of Bit Digital’s production of bitcoin. Actual operating results will vary depending on many factors including network difficulty rate, total hash rate of the network, the operations of our facilities, the status of our miners, and other factors. See “Safe Harbor Statement” below.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release may contain certain “forward-looking statements” relating to the business of Bit Digital, Inc., and its subsidiary companies.

Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under “Risk Factors” in Item 3.D of our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. If any material risk was to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or bitcoin hash rate may also materially affect the future performance of Bit Digital’s production of bitcoin. Actual operating results will vary depending on many factors including network difficulty rate, total hash rate of the network, the operations of our facilities, the status of our miners, and other factors.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release may contain certain “forward-looking statements” relating to the business of Bit Digital, Inc., and its subsidiary companies.

Executes MSA with Boosteroid, Third-Largest Cloud Gaming Provider, For Initial Deployment\n\n###### NEWS\n\nNEW YORK, November 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Bit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT) (“Bit Digital” or the “Company”), a global platform for high-performance computing (“HPC”) infrastructure and digital asset production headquartered in New York, announced today that it has executed a Master Service Agreement (“MSA”) with Boosteroid Inc. (“Boosteroid”), a global cloud gaming provider and new customer of Bit Digital’s high-performance computing (“HPC”) services. Bit Digital previously announced that it had signed a binding term sheet with Boosteroid on August 19, 2024.\n\nBit Digital has finalized a purchase order for the starting quantity of GPUs. The initial order of 300 GPUs is expected to generate approximately $4.6 million in revenue to Bit Digital over the five-year term, or approximately $0.9 million per year. The initial purchase will include GPU-servers based on AMD EPYC 4th Gen CPUs and RX7900XT GPUs, customized by ASUSTeK Computer Inc. (“ASUS”) and AMD for Boosteroid. Bit Digital expects the GPUs to be delivered to respective data centers across the U.S and begin earning revenue by the end of November 2024. The agreement provides Boosteroid with the option to expand in increments of 100 servers, up to 50,000 servers, representing a potential $700 million revenue opportunity for Bit Digital over the five-year term, contingent on deployment plans and market conditions.\n\nSam Tabar, Bit Digital’s CEO, commented: “We are thrilled to solidify our partnership with Boosteroid and embark on what we see as a substantial growth opportunity for both companies. Our team is committed to delivering high-quality service in the initial phase, laying the groundwork for significant expansion in 2025.”\n\n**About Boosteroid**\n\nBoosteroid is the world’s third-largest cloud gaming provider, following Microsoft and Nvidia. With a GPU-based infrastructure network spanning 22 data centers and 10 more expected to launch by the end of 2024, Boosteroid serves over 5.7 million users across Europe, North America, and South America. It partners with major brands like Google for cloud gaming on Chrome OS, and collaborates with Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Hisense, Philips, Sharp, etc. Boosteroid uses custom hardware solutions designed by ASUS, AMD, and other companies tailored specifically for their platform.\n\n**About Bit Digital**\n\nBit Digital, Inc. is a global platform for high-performance computing (“HPC”) infrastructure and digital asset production headquartered in New York City. Our bitcoin mining operations are located in the US, Canada, and Iceland. The Company has established a business line, Bit Digital AI, that offers infrastructure services for artificial intelligence applications. For additional information, please contact ir@bit-digital.com or visit our website at [www.bit-digital.com](http://www.bit-digital.com/).\n\n**Investor Notice**\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under “Risk Factors” in Item 3.D of our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. If any material risk was to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or bitcoin hash rate may also materially affect the future performance of Bit Digital’s production of bitcoin. Actual operating results will vary depending on many factors including network difficulty rate, total hash rate of the network, the operations of our facilities, the status of our miners, and other factors.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release may contain certain “forward-looking statements” relating to the business of Bit Digital, Inc., and its subsidiary companies.
