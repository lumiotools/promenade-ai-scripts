a global business services and asset finance solutions provider, reported results for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNajeeb Ghauri, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of NETSOL Technologies Inc., commented, \"We’re continue to build on the foundation we laid in 2024, achieving profitability in the first fiscal quarter of 2025 driven by a 26% increase in recurring subscription and support revenues and consistent services revenues when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Moreover, we are strengthening our balance sheet and are aggressively but strategically investing in the growth of our business, with a particular focus on AI, as we expand our product offerings and grow our presence in both new and existing geographic markets.”\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Results**\n\nTotal net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 3% to $14.6 million, compared with $14.2 million in the prior year period, driven by a 26% increase in subscription and support revenues and consistent services revenues in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, total net revenues were $14.5 million.\n\n  * No meaningful license fees compared with $1.3 million in the prior year period.\n  * Total subscription (SaaS and Cloud) and support revenues increased 26% to $8.2 million compared with $6.5 million in the prior year period. Total subscription and support revenues as percentage of sales increased to 56%, compared with 46% in the prior year period. Total subscription and support revenues on a constant currency basis were $8.1 million.\n  * Total services revenues were $6.4 million, compared with $6.5 million in the prior year period. Total services revenues on a constant currency basis were $6.3 million.\n\n\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $6.6 million or 45% of net revenues, compared to $6.2 million or 43% of net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On a constant currency basis, gross profit was $6.7 million or 46% of net revenues as measured on a constant currency basis.\n\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $7.3 million or 50% of sales compared to $5.8 million or 41% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses were $7.2 million or 49% of sales on a constant currency basis.\n\nLoss from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $(760,000) compared to income from operations of $350,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nGAAP net income attributable to NETSOL for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled $71,000 or $0.006 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income of $31,000 or 0.003 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n\nNon-GAAP EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $302,000 or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP EBITDA of $805,000 or $0.07 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (see note regarding “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $204,000 or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $466,000 or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year period (see note regarding “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).\n\n**Balance Sheet and Capital Structure**\n\nCash and cash equivalents was $24.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $19.1 million as of June 30, 2024. Working capital was $24.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $23.6 million as of June 30, 2024. Total NETSOL stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, was $34.7 million or $3.03 per share.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our performance in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by encouraging trends including a double-digit increase in subscription and support revenue and consistent services revenues when compared to the first quarter of 2024,” Najeeb Ghauri, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of NETSOL Technologies Inc., commented. “Importantly, we achieved these results without recognizing any meaningful license fees in the quarter, demonstrating a shift in our revenue to rely less on large, one-time licensing fees and benefit from more predictable and consistent SaaS sales.\n\n“We continued to invest in the growth of our business during the quarter,” Mr. Ghauri continued. “Geographic expansion remains a key strategic focus for us, and we believe that there is significant opportunity for growth in new markets, as well as the ones that we currently hold a leadership position in as we continue to innovate and evolve our product offerings to meet shifting market demands. The recent product rebranding has been particularly well received and we’re focused on investing in our business development initiatives to create a more sustainable pipeline of opportunities across all our markets.\n\n“Growth in the United States continues to be a top priority, and we’re making encouraging progress as we continue to penetrate this region. During the quarter, we announced a five-year, $16 million deal with a major automaker and to revolutionize their digital car buying experience through Transcend Retail, our omnichannel digital retail platform. We’re performing in our established markets as well – during the quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with a major automaker in China increasing the contract value to over $30 million, demonstrating our strength of customer relationships and ongoing demand for our products from Tier 1 names in the auto industry. We remain confident that we will be able to achieve double digit revenue growth this fiscal year.”\n\nRoger Almond, Chief Financial Officer of NETSOL Technologies Inc., commented, “Our first quarter results reflect the strengthening of our business model with solid growth of our recurring revenue base. From a liquidity standpoint, we strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter with a cash position of $24.5 million compared with $19.1 million at the close of fiscal 2024, as well as improved working capital. Looking ahead, we believe that NETSOL is well positioned to deliver double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and drive enhanced value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nNETSOL Technologies management will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 13, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (6:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these financial results.
