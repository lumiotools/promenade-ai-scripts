The Z100 smart glasses provide users with the heads-up information display they expect from an everyday wearable. Vuzix Z100 pairs seamlessly via Bluetooth to Android and IOS smart phones that are running the newly-upgraded Vuzix Connect mobile application version 1.7, which pushes real-time information to the glasses, including notifications, updates, and messaging.\n\n[ ![Vuzix Z100 smart glasses](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2562824/Vuzix_Z100_smart_glasses.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2562824/Vuzix_Z100_smart_glasses.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nVuzix Z100 smart glasses pack industry-defining heads-up waveguide technology into a sleek, fashionable form factor that weighs in at just 38 grams – the weight of a standard pair of glasses. Running up to 48 hours on a single charge, they deliver a crisp, transparent, monochrome image that can deliver important information hands-free while providing a natural AI delivery interface.\n\nFor enterprise users, these safety glasses-certified smart glasses are made for all day comfort. Using them, frontline workers can get a human-centered connection to AI and work process applications, receiving critical updates, convenient workflow and task confirmations, and instant notifications in real time, all while wearing a pair of sleek, attractive glasses. Vuzix Z100 smart glasses can augment the data feeds from finger scanners, sensors, controllers, and other equipment making that data available in a new and highly accessible format. Users can now have their workflows displayed in the heads-up display, providing human-centered outputs and real-time updates.\n\nWith the Vuzix Connect mobile app, wearers can easily configure their Vuzix Z100 smart glasses to show notifications from many of their smartphone apps, making reading texts and direct messages from social apps easy and instantaneous. The upgraded Vuzix Connect mobile app now comes with a teleprompter feature, and provides a fitness application to help meet exercise milestones. Users can run or bike while monitoring their pace, and even their step counts while walking. Having this information readily in view is safer and more effective than having to look at a fitness watch, especially when enjoying outdoor sports. In addition, other apps can still be tracking and recording a workout while the Connect app is displaying these training metrics. The Android version of the Vuzix Connect mobile app can also be configured to display turn-by-turn directions from Google maps. Once again, this is critical when walking or cycling, when it's inconvenient and unsafe to be continually looking down at the phone.\n\nThe Vuzix Connect mobile app also features a translation and transcription engine. This allows the wearer to see the text of what others around them are saying, just like watching closed captioning on a television, even if the conversation is in a different language. Unlike using these features on a smartphone, the wearer can remain engaged in the conversation, instead of focusing on their phone. \n\n\"The Z100 takes AI/AR smart glasses to the next level, providing individuals with a hands-free AI interface that is indistinguishable from a traditional pair of glasses,\" said Paul Travers, President and Chief Executive Officer at Vuzix. \"The Z100 is an attractive, lightweight, and cost-effective way to augment current workflows with AI optimization software, inside a device that people will enjoy wearing all day, every day and it is built and priced with the broad market white label customer in mind.\"\n\nFor more information on Vuzix Z100 smart glasses, please visit: <https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses>\n\n**About Vuzix Corporation**\n\nVuzix is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of AI driven Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and products for the enterprise, medical, defense and consumer markets.

This collaboration is expected to accelerate the development and scaling of next-generation AI smart glasses, expanding Vuzix' reach into the growing OEM market,\" said Paul Travers, President and CEO of Vuzix. \"The Company also continued to scale its waveguide manufacturing capabilities and feels it has a significant competitive advantage given its industry-leading cost efficiency.\"\n\n\"At the same time, cost discipline remains a cornerstone of Vuzix' strategy. The Company achieved a 28% year-over-year reduction in quarterly cash operating expenses during the third quarter, enhancing financial efficiency and extending its operational runway,\" added Mr. Travers.\n\nThe following table compares condensed elements of the Company's unaudited summarized Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n\n**For Three Months Ended September 30**  \n---  \n**($000s except per share amounts)**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Sales:**  \nSales of Products |  $ 988 |  $1,371  \nSales of Engineering Services |  397 |  808  \n**Total Sales** |  1,386 |  2,180  \n**Total Cost of Sales** |  1,646 |  2,418  \n**Gross Profit (Loss)** |  (260) |  (238)  \nGross Profit (Loss) % |  (19) % |  (11) %  \n**Operating Expenses:**  \nResearch and Development |  2,334 |  2,913  \nSelling and Marketing |  1,766 |  2,832  \nGeneral and Administrative |  4,347 |  4,467  \nDepreciation and Amortization |  411 |  959  \nImpairment on Intangible Asset & Equity   \nInvestment |  182 |  -  \nImpairment of Patents and Trademarks |  - |  24  \n**Loss from Operations** |  (9,299) |  _(11,432)_  \nTotal Other Income (Expense) |  77 |  449  \n**Net Loss** |  (9,222) |  (10,983)  \n**Loss per Common Share** |  $ (0.14) |  $ (0.17)  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues decreased by 36% to $1.4 million versus $2.2 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was the result of a 28% decrease in smart glasses products sales and a 51% decrease in engineering services revenues as compared to the prior year's quarter.\n\nThere was an overall gross loss of $0.26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gross loss of $0.24 million for the same period in 2023. The 9% increased gross loss was the result of lower revenues and planned reduced smart glasses production to absorb many of the company's relatively fixed manufacturing overhead costs.\n\nResearch and Development expense was $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus $2.9 million for the comparable 2023 period, a decrease of approximately 20%. This decrease was primarily due to reduced external development costs and salary and benefits related expenses due to lower headcount.\n\nSelling and Marketing expense was $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus $2.8 million for the comparable 2023 period, a decrease of approximately 38%. This decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and tradeshow spending and travel-related expenses and reduced salary and benefits expenses due to lower headcount.\n\nGeneral and Administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.3 million versus $4.5 million for the comparable 2023 period, a decrease of approximately 3%. The decrease was largely due to reduced salary and benefits related expenses and a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation.\n\nThe net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.2 million, or $0.14 cents per share versus a net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.17 for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total cash operating expenses, a non-GAAP measure consisting of the sum of our total operating expenses less non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges, was $4.7 million versus $6.7 million for the comparable 2023 period, a reduction of 28%. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintained cash and cash equivalents of $14.3 million and an overall working capital position of $26.5 million. The Company has made great strides towards reductions in our cash expenses over the past year and believes this non-GAAP measure highlights its progress. The table below is a reconciliation of our adjusted cash loss from operations (Non-GAAP) to our loss from operations (GAAP):\n\n**Consolidated Operating Expenses ($ in thousands)** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023** |  **Dollar Change** |  **% Increase (Decrease)**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Operating Expenses (GAAP)** |  **$ 9.0** |  **$11.2** |  **$(2.2)** |  **(20) %**  \n**Non-Cash Operating Expenses** |  **(4.3)** |  **(4.5)** |  **0.2** |  **(4) %**  \n**_____________** |  **_____________** |  **_____________**  \n**Adjusted Operating Expenses (Non-GAAP)** |  **$4.7** |  **$6.7** |  **$(2.0)** |  **(30) %**  \n  \n**Management Outlook**\n\n\"Both our enterprise smart glasses and broad market OEM pipeline prospects continue to expand. The defense and security sectors remain promising as well, as Vuzix has advanced its collaboration with Thales Corporation, a global leader in aerospace and defense. This project highlights the versatility and performance of Vuzix' advanced optical technology in mission-critical head-mounted display applications as Thales moves toward production-ready deployment,\" continued Mr. Travers.\n\n\"Vuzix is making significant progress in its transition to an expanded OEM-driven model while continuing to support enterprise markets.

The decrease was largely due to reduced salary and benefits related expenses and a\ndecrease in non-cash stock-based compensation.\nThe net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.2 million, or $0.14\ncents per share versus a net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.17 for the comparable period in\n2023.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total cash operating expenses, a non-GAAP measure\nconsisting of the sum of our total operating expenses less non-cash stock-based\ncompensation, depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges, was $4.7 million versus\n$6.7 million for the comparable 2023 period, a reduction of 28%. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company maintained cash and cash equivalents of $14.3 million and an overall working\ncapital position of $26.5 million. The Company has made great strides towards reductions in\nour cash expenses over the past year and believes this non-GAAP measure highlights its\nprogress.
