Election/Appointment: Other than External Directors (as defined below), members of the Board (“Directors”) are either elected by the Company’s shareholders at the annual general shareholders’ meeting (the “Annual General Meeting”) or appointed by the Board in between Annual General Meetings in accordance with the provisions of the Company’s Restated Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time.\n\nNominees to be External Directors are elected at an Annual General Meeting for an initial three-year term, after which they can be elected for additional term(s) of three years.\n\nPursuant to Section 5A of the Israeli Companies Regulations (Concessions for Public Companies Traded on Stock Markets Outside of Israel) – 5760-2000, an External Director in a “dual listed” company (including the Company), may be elected for additional terms (beyond the first three terms) of up to three years each, if the board’s audit committee and the company’s board find that due to the External Director’s expertise and unique contribution to the work of the company’s board and its committees, his/her nomination for an additional term is in the best interests of the company, and these considerations are presented at the Annual General Meeting prior to the shareholders approving the additional term. There is no general limitation on the number of terms a director (including an External Director in a “dual listed” company, subject however to the above requirements) may serve.\n\nPursuant to Section 5A(a) of the Israeli Companies Regulations (Concessions for Public Companies Traded on Stock Markets Outside of Israel) – 5760-2000, an Independent Director in a “dual listed” company (including the Company), may be classified as an Independent Director as long as he/she meets the eligibility requierments set in Sections 240(b)-(f) of the Companies Law (as defined below) and as long as his/her term of office does not exceed nine consecitive years (in this regard, a break in his/her term of office which does not exceed two years shall not be deemed as interrupting the sequence of his/her term). Notwithstanding the abovementioned, pursuant to Section 5A(b) of the Israeli Companies Regulations (Concessions for Public Companies Traded on Stock Markets Outside of Israel) – 5760-2000, Independent Directors may be elected for additional terms (beyond nine years) of up to three years each, if the board’s audit committee and the company’s Board find that due to the Independent Director’s expertise and unique contribution to the work of the Company’s Board and its committees, his/her nomination for an additional term is in the best interests of the company, and these considerations are presented at the Annual General Meeting prior to the shareholders approving the additional term. There is no general limitation on the number of terms a director (including an Independent Director in a “dual listed” company, subject however to the above requirements) may serve.\n\n3. Independence of Directors:\n\n(a)  Independent Directors. The Company is subject to Director independence and related rules that impact the Director nomination process arising from the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. Market Place Rules (“Nasdaq Rules”). The Nasdaq Rules require, inter alia, that a majority of the members of the Board meet certain director independence criteria. The Nasdaq director independence criteria are set forth in Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules. In addition, members of the audit committee must meet the additional independence criteria required by Rule 10A-3(b)(1) and members of the commpensation committee must meet the additional independence criteria required by Nasdaq Rule 5605(d)(2). \n\n(b)  External Directors. The Company is required under Israeli law to have two Directors who are “External Directors”, as defined in the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the “Companies Law”). The Companies Law criteria for External Directors are similar but not identical to the independence director criteria under the Nasdaq Rules. The threshold requirements for an External Director are set forth in Section 240 of the Companies Law.\n\n(c) Independence Statement. The Board will consist of at least a majority of independent directors. For this purpose, a director will be considered independent for as long as he or she meets the criteria for independence required by Nasdaq Rules. \n\n4. Accounting and Financial Expertise:\n\n(a)  Israeli Companies Law. The Companies Law requires that at least one External Director has “accounting and financial expertise” while the other(s) are required to have “professional expertise” or “accounting and financial expertise.” The Companies Law also requires the Board, after considering the company’s type and size and the scope and complexity of its activities, to determine the minimum number of directors on the board having “accounting and financial expertise.” Our Board has adopted a policy pursuant to which it will include a minimum of two Directors (including one External Director) having “accounting and financial expertise.”\n\n(b) Nasdaq. Under Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(2), the Company must have, and certify that it has and will continue to have, an audit committee of at least three members, each of whom must: (i) be an “Independent Director” as defined under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2); (ii) meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (subject to the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c) under the Exchange Act); (iii) not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past three years; and (iv) be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. Additionally, the Company must certify that it has, and will continue to have, at least one member of the audit committee who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting or any other comparable experience or background which results in the individual’s financial sophistication, including being or having been a chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other senior officer with financial oversight responsibilities.[1]\n\n5.  Board Diversity: Under Nasdaq Rule 5605(F), the Company must (i) publicly disclose board-level diversity statistics using a standardized template and (ii) have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors, including one female and one underrepresented individual or two female directors. The Board recognizes the value of diversity among its members, with differences in background, experience, gender and other qualities of directors that will contribute to the ability of the Board to consider a broader range of perspectives. Board members are appointed based on merit and suitability. At the same time, the Committee will consider diversity factors, including gender, in order to maintain a balanced and effective Board and to enable wide-ranging discussions. As a matter of policy, the Board strives that at least 25% of its members be gender diverse.\n\n6.  Board Meeting Attendance: Board members are expected to commit substantial time and energy to their service as such. In this respect, Board members are expected to attend at least 90% of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve (unless in cases of unavoidable circumstances). Attendance of members at Board and committee meetings will be disclosed as required by the Applicable Laws and Regulations.\n\n7. Limitation on Additional Board Memberships: The Board recognizes the benefits of its members’ service on the boards of other companies. However, the Board is of the opinion that the number of such memberships should be reasonably limited, in order to allow its members to devote sufficient time to fulfill their duties as directors of the Company. Therefore, it is expected that a director will not serve on the boards of more than four other publicly traded companies (academic institutions and non-profit organizations excluded).\n\n**Nomination Process**\n\n1.  Questionnaire and Resume: All new candidates for nomination to the Board will provide a resume to, and complete a director qualification criteria questionnaire and any other statements or forms distributed by, the Company’s Corporate Secretary (the “Secretary”). Directors who are re-nominated for continued serve on the Board should complete an updated questionnaire and any other statements or forms as required (a) prior to the filing of the Company’s Annual Report; (b) prior to the Company’s entering into a public offering; and (c) in other situations that may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\n\n2. Nominating Committee Meetings: The completed questionnaires for all nominees and Board members will be provided by the Secretary to the Committee, which will convene in a timely manner to review and approve nominees for appointment or election to the Board, whether by shareholders at an Annual General Meeting or by the Board for appointments between Annual General Meetings. If deemed appropriate by the Chair, the Committee may conduct interviews with nominees.\n\n3. Nominating Committee/Board Recommendations: The Committee will review all candidates for nomination and/or renomination to the Board. After the Committee completes its review and discussion of the candidates, the Committee will provide its recommendation to the Board as a whole within a reasonable time prior to the Board’s appointment of a nominee and/or the Board’s recommendation to the Company shareholders at a General Meeting for the election of directors, whether External Directors or otherwise.[2] With respect to nominees to be elected at a General Meeting, the Board will then consider the Committee’s recommendation and provide the Board’s recommendation to shareholders.\n\n[1] Note that a director who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under Item 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K, is presumed to qualify as a financially sophisticated audit committee member under Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). [2] Notwithstanding this provision, note that (a) under the Companies Law, independency of directors should be determined by the audit committee (see definition of “Independent Director” under Section 1 of the Companies Law, and the provisions of Section 5A to the Concessions Regulations), and (b) under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), the body determining who is an “Independent Director” is the board.\n\n####  RESTATED CHARTER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE \n\nAdopted by the Board of Directors\n\nI. **INTRODUCTION**.\n\nA. Elbit Systems Ltd. (“Elbit Systems” or the “Company”) is a corporation formed under the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the “Companies Law”), with its shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”), and on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (the “TASE”).\n\nB.

Committee Composition. There will be at least three (3) and no more than five (5) members (individually a “Member” and collectively the “Members”) serving on the Committee, all of whom will be Directors.\n\nB.

All other Members will be appointed to the Committee by the Board and may be removed by the Board.\n\nC. Chair. The chair of the Committee will be an External Director (the “Chair”). The Chair will be appointed by the Board, however, in reference to Article 26(b) of the Company’s Restated Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time (the “Articles”), if no Chair is appointed by the Board for the Committee, then the Committee Members may elect a Chair.\n\nD.

The Committee will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any and all such Advisors retained by the Committee, and will have the direct responsibility and authority to approve the fees and other terms of such Advisors, to oversee their work and to terminate them if it deems proper.\n\nB. Elbit Systems will provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, for payment of reasonable compensation to any such Advisors retained by the Committee pursuant to this Charter.\n\nC. The Committee may select, or receive advice from, an Advisor to the Committee, other than in-house legal counsel or other Company management personnel, only after taking into consideration the following six factors (the “Independence Assessment”)[3]:\n\ni. the provision of other services to the Company by the person that employs the Advisor;\n\nii. the amount of fees received from the Company by the person that employs the Advisor, as a percentage of the total revenue of the person that employs the Advisor;\n\niii. the policies and procedures of the person that employs the Advisor that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest;\n\niv. any business or personal relationship of the Advisor with a member of the Committee;\n\nv. any stock of the Company owned by the Advisor; and\n\nvi. any business or personal relationship of the Advisor or the person employing the advisor with an Executive Officer of the Company.\n\nD. Nothing in this Section V will be construed: (i) to require the Committee to consult with an Advisor or obtain any external advice; (ii) to require the Committee to implement or act consistently with the advice or recommendations of the Advisor to the Committee; or (iii) to affect the ability or obligation of the Committee to exercise its own judgment in fulfillment of its duties.\n\nVI. **MEETINGS**.\n\nA. Meetings. The Committee will meet at least annually or more frequently as required by the Applicable Laws and Regulations or based on the Company’s needs. The Committee may also hold special meetings or act by unanimous written consent, and the Committee meetings will be governed by the procedures generally applicable to meetings of the Board under the Articles, unless otherwise stated by resolution of the Board or the Committee.\n\nB.  Additional Participants. A person that is not eligible to be a Member may not be present during Committee meetings or votes unless the Chair determines that such person is required for presentation of a matter on the agenda. If requested by the Committee, a Company employee that is not the Company’s controlling shareholder or his or her “relative,” as such term is defined in the Companies Law, may be present during Committee meetings (but not votes). Notwithstanding the above, if requested by the Committee, the Secretary (as defined below), provided he or she is not the Company’s controlling shareholder or his or her “relative” as such term is defined in the Companies Law, may be present during Committee meetings and votes.\n\nC. Quorum. Quorum will be constituted when a majority of the Members of the Committee will be present at the meeting.\n\nD.  Role of Corporate Secretary. The Company’s corporate secretary (the “Secretary”) will administer the minutes, correspondence, distribution of materials and action items of the Committee under the direction of the Chair.\n\nE.  Rules for Conduct of Business. Except to the extent otherwise provided by the Applicable Laws and Regulations or by the Board, and taking into account requirements with respect to potential conflicts of interest of Committee members for a particular matter, the Committee may make, alter and repeal rules for conducting its business. In the absence of such rules, the Committee will conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts its business pursuant to the Applicable Laws and Regulations and the Articles.\n\nVII. **REPORTS AND MINUTES**.\n\nA. Reports. Consistent with the Applicable Laws and Regulations, the Committee will report to the Board on the matters approved and the major items covered at each Committee meeting.\n\nB. Minutes. The Committee will maintain minutes of each of its meetings. The minutes will be filed and kept in Elbit Systems’ offices.\n\nVIII. **PERIODIC REVIEW OF THIS CHARTER**.\n\nThe Committee will review and reassess, periodically as it deems appropriate, the adequacy of this Charter and will recommend to the Board to amend this Charter if and as necessary in light of such review. In case of a conflict between any of the Applicable Laws and Regulations and this Charter, the Applicable Laws and Regulations will govern with respect to such matters.\n\n[1] According to the Companies Law, an audit committee that meets the conditions in Section 118A(b) of the Companies Law can also serve as a compensation committee. [2] In addition, Nasdaq Rule 5605(d)(2)(A) requires that in affirmatively determining the independence of any Director who will serve on the Committee, the Board must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the Company which is material to that Director’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Committee member, including, but not limited to: (i) the source of compensation of such Director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the Company to such Director; and (ii) whether such Director is affiliated with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the Company (an “Affiliate Relationship”). When considering the sources of a Director’s compensation for this purpose, the Board should consider whether the Director receives compensation from any person or entity that would impair the Director’s ability to make independent judgments about the Executive Officers compensation. Similarly, in determining independence for purposes of Committee service, when considering any Affiliate Relationship of a Director, the Board should consider whether the Affiliate Relationship places the Director under the direct or indirect control of the Company or its senior management, or creates a direct relationship between the Director and members of senior management, of a nature that would impair the Director’s ability to make independent judgments about Executive Officer compensation. [3] Pursuant to Nasdaq Rules, the Committee may select, or receive advice from, any compensation adviser they prefer, including ones that are not independent, after considering the six independence factors outlined above. In addition, the Committee is not required to conduct an Independence Assessment for an Advisor that acts in a role limited to the following activities for which no disclosure is required under Item 407(e)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: (a) consulting on any broad-based plan that does not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation, in favor of Office Holders of the Company, and that is available generally to all salaried employees; and/or (b) providing information that either is not customized for a particular company or that is customized based on parameters that are not developed by the Advisor, and about which the Advisor does not provide advice.\n\n[![](https://elbitsystems.com/wp-content/themes/anova_blank/assets/images/up.png)](#)\n\nWelcome!

This is consistent with our policy of emphasizing responsible and ethical business practices. Our ESG policies are overseen by our board of directors (Board) and managed by our senior management. We establish multi-year ESG-related goals. Our ESG activities support our involvement as active members in leading sustainability and ethics organizations. We published an ESG Highlights Report for years 2021-2022, available on our website, detailing our main ESG-related activities, including our progress towards achieving ESG-related goals.\n\nTo view our latest ESG- Sustainability Report,**[click here](https://elbitsystems.com/media/Elbit-Sustainability-2023-accessible.pdf)**.\n\n_**Environmental, Health and Safety Compliance.**_ As part of our overall ESG**policies,** we are committed to leading environmental, health and safety standards in all aspects of our operations. This includes all regulatory requirements as well as compliance with ISO-14001 and ISO-45001 standards. We also conduct a number of measures on an ongoing basis to promote environmentally friendly operational practices and address climate change goals, including measures to reduce electricity, fuel and water consumption, to increase recycling and to incorporate environmental protection measures in our manufacturing processes. We are also engaged in various business and operational activities related to the environment. For example, in 2023 one of our subsidiaries, Opgal Optronic Industries Ltd., added a production line for its methane leaks detection camera, which enables monitoring and treatment of greenhouse gas emissions that are harmful to the environment.\n\nWe utilize a global EHS management system and internal audits and surveys to address risk analysis, regulatory compliance and policy updates. EHS risks are an integral part of our risk management processes. We periodically review and assess our compliance with applicable EHS regulations and our internal policies, address gaps and establish corresponding action plans. In 2023, we participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project for the fourth time and published for the fourth time an EHS report summarizing key elements of our compliance activities, which is available on our website. There are no material environmental issues that prevent the Company from using our facilities or materially affect our ongoing activities.\n\nTo view our latest EHS report,[**click here**](https://elbitsystems.com/media/EHS-report-2022-final-V2.pdf).\n\nFor more information,[**click here**](https://elbitsystems.com/environmental-health-safety-policy/).\n\n**_Corporate Governance, Ethics and Anti-Corruption._** We conduct our business activities and develop Company policies based on a firm commitment to ethical practices and corporate governance best practices. Our Board complies with leading corporate governance practices as set forth in Board committee charters published on our website. We also promote gender diversity among our Board members and have adopted a policy of having at least 25% gender-diverse members on our Board. We also have a dedicated process for risk management that is coordinated with our Board.\n\nIn addition to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Ethics Code) and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have an active Company-wide ethics compliance program, incorporating a range of policies and procedures. This includes the anti-bribery/corruption area where we have a policy of zero tolerance for corruption. Our anti-bribery/corruption compliance program also includes a number of elements such as whistleblower and investigation processes, contractual requirements, due diligence, ongoing organization-wide as well as function-focused training, record keeping and enforcement. We also expect our supply chain and Industrial Participation/ offset transactions to follow ethical practices (see “Supply Chain Compliance” below). Our Ethics Code, Whistleblower and Investigations Procedure, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Compliance Policy, Procedure on Anti-Bribery and Corruption Due Diligence, Business Entertainment and Gifts Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct are published on our website. We are also active in a number of international organizations relating to ethics and compliance.\n\nFor more information on our Ethics and Conduct,[**click here**](https://elbitsystems.com/ethics-and-conduct/)**.**\n\n_**Fair Labor Practices and Human Rights.**_ Our ESG policies address fairness and transparency in our workforce, and we promote and implement fair labor practices and employees’ human rights throughout our organization. Our Human Rights Statement, which was adopted by our Board, is published on our website. We respect data privacy relating to our employees. We act to prevent sexual harassment and workplace bullying. We also implement non-discriminatory hiring and promotion practices and actively pursue gender diversity in our workforce. In addition, we promote transparency with our employees regarding our labor and management practices. As part of the implementation of the Equal Pay for Female and Male Employees Law in Israel, we conduct an evaluation regarding possible gender pay gaps among our employees according to the criteria provided by the law, and publish the results on our website. We also provide certain information to our employees, as required under the law.\n\nTo view our Human Rights Statement,[ **click here**](https://elbitsystems.com/media/Human-Rights-Statement-May-24-2021.pdf).\n\n**_Compliance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions._** All of our activities in the area of munitions, including those of IMI, are in compliance with the international Convention on Cluster Munitions that entered into force in August 2010.\n\n**Supply Chain Compliance.** Our policy is to follow leading ESG practices in relation to our supply chain. Our suppliers are required to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is published on our website, that addresses supply chain compliance issues such as fair labor practices, combating human trafficking, ethics and anti-corruption, avoidance of conflicts of interests, restrictions on the use of conflict minerals, cyber security and prevention of counterfeit parts. Our Supplier Code of Conduct also provides a whistleblower mechanism for current and potential members of our supply chain. Our Industrial Participation/ offset activities also are conducted in accordance with our supply chain compliance policies and procedures.\n\nTo view our Supplier Code of Conduct,[ **click here**](https://elbitsystems.com/media/Supplier-code-ofconduct-accessible-4.2022.pdf).\n\n**_Community-Related Activities._** Our ESG policy encourages the voluntary efforts of our Company entities and employees, who donate their time and efforts in the support of members of our communities who are in need. In this regard, we strive to give priority to initiatives that promote educational advancement in less developed communities, particularly in the technology sectors. We also focus on initiatives that encourage greater numbers of women to engage in engineering-related careers. We promote numerous other community support activities, including involvement on a national level in major charitable organizations in Israel and the U.S.\n\nWelcome!
