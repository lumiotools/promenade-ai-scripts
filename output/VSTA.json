Financial results are expressed in Brazilian Reais and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Vasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle to date totaled R$1,152 million, a 13.8% increase compared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle. In 2Q24, subscription revenue totaled R$280 million, a 32.5% increase compared to 2Q23 due to the previously disclosed shift in product deliveries, which were deferred to the third quarter of our sales cycle, or 2Q24. \n  * Our subscription revenue reached 85.3% of Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings for the 2024 sales cycle, a 1.4 p.p. increase compared to the 2023 sales cycle to date (83.9%). This indicator allows us to reaffirm our expectation that by the end of the period we will have achieved 12% organic growth compared to the previous sales cycle to date. \n  * In the 2024 sales cycle to date (which commenced 4Q23 through 2Q24), net revenue increased 11% to R$1,309 million compared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle, mostly due to the conversion of ACV into revenue and to the performance of the B2G unit. In the second quarter, net revenue totaled R$294 million, an 8% increase compared to the previous year. \n  * In the 2024 sales cycle to date, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% to R$428 million compared to R$372 million in previous year, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin grew by 32.7%, which represents an increase of 1.1 p.p. compared to 2023. This increase was mainly driven by gains in operating efficiency, cost savings and a sales mix that benefited from the growth of subscription products. In 2Q24, Adjusted EBITDA totaled R$26 million, a 36% decrease compared to R$41 million in 2Q23, mainly due to higher Commercial expenses and non-recurring positive effects in 2Q23 of a reversion of a provision for doubtful account (PDA) related to a large retail customer. \n  * Vasta recorded an Adjusted Net Profit of R$110 million in the 2024 sales cycle to date, a 65.8% increase compared to an Adjusted Net Profit of R$66 million in previous year. In 2Q24, Adjusted Net Loss totaled R$37 million, a 14.4% increase compared to Adjusted Net Loss of R$32 million in 2Q23. \n  * Free cash flow (FCF) totaled R$90 million in the 2024 sales cycle to date, a 4% increase compared to R$87 million in 2023. In 2Q24 FCF totaled R$38 million, a 59.2% decrease from R$94 million in 2Q23. The last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate improved from 26% to 32% as a result of Vasta’s growth and implementation of sustained efficiency measures. \n  * On June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate amount of R$500 million simple debentures not convertible into shares, comprised of two series, accruing interest at a rate equal to 100% of CDI, which is an average of interbank overnight rates in Brazil, plus a spread of 1.35% per annum for the first series, and 1.60% per annum for the second series. The debentures aim to strengthen the Company's capital structure through the pre-payment of certain existing indebtedness and extension of the Company’s debt maturity profile. The debentures final payment date is currently set at 59 months from the issuance date. This strategic liability management action highlights the Company's commitment to improving its financial stability. By extending the debt maturity and reducing the average interest rate by 50 basis points, the Company not only enhances its liquidity position but also achieves significant cost savings, thereby optimizing its capital structure for future growth. \n  * Starting in 2023, Vasta started to offer its products and services to the Brazilian public sector (B2G). Our broad portfolio of core content solutions, digital platform, and complementary products together with customized learning solutions, tested over decades by the private sector, are now available to the K-12 public schools. With the B2G sector, we generated R$69 million in revenues in the 2024 sales cycle to date (R$40 million in previous sales cycle). \n  * The Start Anglo bilingual school keeps growing with 30 contracts signed as of this date, and 2 operating units boasting bilingual education alongside academic excellence, which reinforces our strategic expansion into new revenue streams and marks the onset of an exhilarating journey. Additionally, Start Anglo made important progress in expanding the offering of our products into a new region of Brazil to reach 11 Brazilian states through a franchise business model. This progress strengthens our brand and generates positive prospects for the business. In addition, we launched the Revitalization project of the Liceu Complex in São Paulo, which will preserve the entire historical architectural design. We expect to commence our flagship operations in São Paulo in 2025. \n\n\n\n**MESSAGE FROM MANAGEMENT**\n\nAs we finished our third quarter of the current sales cycle, our net revenue during the 2024 cycle to date has reached R$1,309 million, representing a 11% increase compared to the same period in the previous year, mostly due to the conversion of ACV into revenue and to the performance of the B2G business unit. Additionally, our complementary solutions have seen an important growth of 20% compared to sales cycle 2023, with an accelerated increase in both student base and market penetration. \n\nVasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle to date totaled R$1,152 million, a 14% increase compared to the same period in the previous sales cycle. Subscription revenue for the 2024 sales cycle to date reached 85.3% of Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings for the 2024 sales cycle, a 1.4 p.p. increase compared to the same period in the 2023 sales cycle (83.9%). This growth is aligned with our previously announced 12% growth projection for our 2024 ACV. \n\nAnother highlight of the 2024 sales cycle to date has been that Adjusted EBITDA grew by 15%, to R$428 million compared to R$372 million in previous sales cycle, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 1.1 p.p. to 32.7%. In proportion to net revenue, gross margin increased 230 bps in the sales cycle to date (from 62.1% to 64.4%) mainly due to better product mix and reduced impact of paper and production costs, Adjusted G&A expenses reduced by 170 bps driven by workforce optimization and budgetary discipline and Commercial expenses increased by 230 bps driven by higher expenses related to business expansion and marketing investments. \n\nFree cashflow (FCF) in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$90 million, a 3.7% increase from R$87 million for the same period in the 2023 sales cycle. The last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate improved for the sixth consecutive quarter, from 26.4% to 31.9%, due to Vasta’s growth and implementation of sustained efficiency measures. Moreover, the net debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA was 2.28x as of 2Q24, having increased slightly from 2.22x in 1Q24, and decreasing from 2.57x in 2Q23. \n\nStart-Anglo bilingual school, a cornerstone of our growth strategy, is experiencing continued expansion. In 2Q24, we entered into 10 new contracts, totaling 30 contracts. Another positive notice concerns the entry into a new region of the country, which creates new possibilities and reaffirms the expansion of our business. With this movement, the Start Anglo is distributed in 11 states in Brazil, with 2 operating units in 2024 and over 300 prospects in negotiation. We believe that the broad geographic presence and strong pipeline underscore the robust potential for further growth and market penetration of Start-Anglo. \n\n**OPERATING PERFORMANCE**\n\n** Student base – subscription models **\n\n2024  |  2023  |  % Y/Y  |  2022  |  % Y/Y   \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPartner schools - Core content  |  4,744  |  5,032  |  (5.7%)  |  5,274  |  (4.6%)   \nPartner schools – Complementary solutions  |  1,722  |  1,383  |  24.5%  |  1,304  |  6.1%   \nStudents - Core content  |  1,432,289  |  1,539,024  |  (6.9%)  |  1,589,224  |  (3.2%)   \nStudents - Complementary content  |  483,132  |  453,552  |  6.5%  |  372,559  |  21.7%   \n  \nNote: Students enrolled in partner schools \n\nIn the 2024 sales cycle, Vasta served nearly 1.4 million students with core content solutions and near 500,000 students with complementary solutions. This is aligned with the company’s strategy to focus on improving its client base in 2024 through a better mix of schools and growth in premium education systems (Anglo, PH, Amplia and Fibonacci), brands with higher average ticket, lower defaults, greater adoption of complementary solutions and longer-term relationships. On the other hand, the reduction of our client base was concentrated on the low-end segment, which have higher number of students on average, and a lower margin. \n\n**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**\n\n** Net revenue **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  % Y/Y   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSubscription  |  279,760  |  211,154  |  32.5%  |  1,152,007  |  1,012,315  |  13.8%   \nCore content  |  275,817  |  206,675  |  33.5%  |  967,821  |  858,751  |  12.7%   \nComplementary solutions  |  3,943  |  4,479  |  (12.0%)  |  184,186  |  153,563  |  19.9%   \nB2G  |  -  |  40,453  |  (100.0%)  |  69,031  |  40,453  |  70.6%   \nNon-subscription  |  14,592  |  19,790  |  (26.3%)  |  88,139  |  126,483  |  (30.3%)   \nTotal net revenue  |  294,352  |  271,396  |  8.5%  |  1,309,177  |  1,179,250  |  11.0%   \n% ACV  |  20.7%  |  17.5%  |  3.2p.p.  |  85.3%  |  83.9%  |  1.4p.p.   \n% Subscription  |  95.0%  |  77.8%  |  17.2p.p.  |  88.0%  |  85.8%  |  2.2p.p.   \n  \nNote: n.m.: not meaningful \n\nIn 2Q24, Vasta’s net revenue totaled R$294 million, a 8.5% increase compared to 2Q23.

In 2Q24, Adjusted EBITDA totaled R$26 million, a 36.3% decrease compared to R$41 million in 2Q23, mostly due to higher commercial expenses in 2024 and a non-recurrent reversion of a provision for doubtful accounts (PDA) related to a large retail customer that occurred in 2Q23. In the 2024 Sales cycle to date, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was mainly driven by gains in operating efficiency, cost savings and a sales mix that benefited from the growth of subscription products, partially offset by higher commercial expenses due to anticipation of marketing events and campaigns for the next cycle. Share of loss equity-accounted investees relates to a 43.1% minority stake in Educbank Gestão de Pagamentos Educacionais S.A. (“Educbank”), which registered a loss in equity-accounted investees in the amount of R$20 million in the 2024 sales cycle to date that was mainly due to write-off costs relating to a potential M&A target of Educbank, which ultimately did not materialize. \n\n_(%) Net Revenue_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  Y/Y (p.p.)  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  Y/Y (p.p.)   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGross margin  |  55.6%  |  56.1%  |  (0.5p.p.)  |  64.4%  |  62.1%  |  2.3p.p.   \nAdjusted cash G&A expenses (1) |  (18.3%)  |  (16.8%)  |  (1.5p.p.)  |  (11.4%)  |  (13.1%)  |  1.7p.p.   \nCommercial expenses  |  (25.0%)  |  (23.9%)  |  (1.1p.p.)  |  (16.3%)  |  (14.1%)  |  (2.2p.p.)   \nImpairment on trade receivables  |  (3.4%)  |  (0.4%)  |  (3.0 p.p.)  |  (4.0%)  |  (3.4%)  |  (0.6p.p.)   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  8.8%  |  15.0%  |  (6.2p.p.)  |  32.7%  |  31.6%  |  1.1p.p.   \n  \n(1) Sum of general and administrative expenses, other operating income and profit (loss) of equity-accounted investees, less: depreciation and amortization, layoffs related to internal restructuring, share-based compensation plan and M&A one-off adjusting expenses. \n\nIn proportion to net revenue, gross margin increased 230 bps in the sales cycle to date (from 62% to 64%) mainly due to better product mix and reduced impact of paper and production costs. Adjusted cash G&A expenses reduced by 170 bps driven by workforce optimization and budgetary discipline and Commercial expenses increased by 220 bps. driven by higher expenses related to business expansion and marketing investments while impairment on trade receivable (PDA) had a slight increase of 60 bps, due to a more restrictive credit landscape. \n\n** Finance Results **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  % Y/Y   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nFinance income  |  16,187  |  17,470  |  (7.3%)  |  46,405  |  66,320  |  (30.0%)   \nFinance costs  |  (63,974)  |  (82,754)  |  (22.7%)  |  (205,176)  |  (232,603)  |  (11.8%)   \nTotal  |  (47,787)  |  (65,284)  |  (26.8%)  |  (158,771)  |  (166,283)  |  (4.5%)   \n  \nIn the second quarter of 2024, finance income totaled R$16.2 million, from R$17.5 million in 2Q23, due to the impact of lower interest rates on financial investments and marketable securities. In the 2024 sales cycle to date, finance income decreased 30% to R$46.4 million from R$ 66,3 million in prior sales cycle, when finance income was impacted with a gain of R$10 million recorded in 4Q22, resulting from the reversal of interest on tax contingencies. \n\nFinance costs in 2Q24 decreased 22.7% to R$64,0 million, from R$82,8 in 2Q23, due to the impact of lower interest rates on financial liabilities (mainly bonds, accounts payable on acquisition and contingencies), as noted above. In the 2024 sales cycle to date finance cost decreased 4.5% driven by the reduction on the Finance Debt position between the comparison quarters and lower interest rate. \n\n** Net profit (loss) **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  % Y/Y   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNet (loss) profit  |  (66,171)  |  (78,611)  |  (15.8%)  |  15,739  |  (4,942)  |  (418.5%)   \n(+) Layoffs related to internal restructuring  |  2,630  |  87  |  n.m.  |  3,610  |  1,182  |  205.4%   \n(+) Share-based compensation plan  |  2,768  |  7,841  |  (64.7%)  |  5,997  |  10,614  |  (43.5%)   \n(+) Amortization of intangible assets (1) |  39,304  |  39,072  |  0.6%  |  118,902  |  117,373  |  1.3%   \n(-) Income tax contingencies reversal  |  -  |  -  |  0.0%  |  -  |  (29,715)  |  (100.0%)   \n(+) M&A adjusting expenses  |  -  |  23,562  |  (100.0%)  |  13,776  |  23,562  |  (41.5%)   \n(-) Tax shield (2) |  (15,199)  |  (23,991)  |  (36.6%)  |  (48,377)  |  (51,929)  |  (6.8%)   \nAdjusted net (loss) profit  |  (36,668)  |  (32,040)  |  14.4%  |  109,647  |  66,145  |  65.8%   \nAdjusted net margin  |  (12.5%)  |  (11.8%)  |  (0.7p.p.)  |  8.4%  |  5.6%  |  2.8p.p.   \n  \nNote: n.m.: not meaningful; (1) From business combinations.

It is worth highlighting that 2Q and 3Q of every year represents about 30% of the total revenue of the year due to seasonality of product deliveries to our customers. In the 2024 sales cycle to date, adjusted net profit reached R$110 million, a 65.8% increase from an adjusted net profit of R$66 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nThe 2023 sales cycle was positively impacted by a gain related to the reversal of tax contingencies recorded in 4Q22, which impacted corporate tax and finance results, but negatively impacted by M&A expenses in the amount of R$ 24 million. The 2024 sales cycle to date was impacted by the M&A adjusting expenses occurred in 4Q23 as they related to one-off costs associated with the write-off of a potential M&A target of Educbank, which ultimately did not materialize, negatively impacting our Share of Loss of Equity-Accounted Investees in the amount of R$13.8 million. \n\n** Accounts receivable and PDA **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  1Q24  |  % Q/Q   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGross accounts receivable  |  755,133  |  632,151  |  19.5%  |  864,511  |  (12.7%)   \nProvision for doubtful accounts (PDA)  |  (93,543)  |  (64,870)  |  44.2%  |  (93,489)  |  0.1%   \nCoverage index  |  12.4%  |  10.3%  |  2.1p.p.  |  10.8%  |  1.57p.p.   \nNet accounts receivable  |  661,590  |  567,281  |  16.6%  |  771,022  |  (14.2%)   \nAverage days of accounts receivable (1) |  152  |  149  |  3  |  180  |  (28)   \n  \n(1) Balance of net accounts receivable divided by the last-twelve-month net revenue, multiplied by 360. \n\nThe average payment term of Vasta’s accounts receivable portfolio was 152 days in the 2Q24 remained stable than the same quarter of the previous year (149 days). \n\n** Free cash flow **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  2Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  % Y/Y   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCash from operating activities (1) |  68,866  |  127,546  |  (46.0%)  |  228,582  |  228,457  |  0.1%   \n(-) Income tax and social contribution paid  |  -  |  (334)  |  n.m.  |  (672)  |  (5,082)  |  (86.8%)   \n(-) Payment of provision for tax, civil and labor losses  |  (64)  |  (549)  |  (88.0%)  |  (440)  |  (794)  |  n.m.   \n(-) Interest lease liabilities paid  |  (2,579)  |  (3,418)  |  (24.5%)  |  (6,109)  |  (11,214)  |  (45.5%)   \n(-) Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment  |  (1,910)  |  (4,092)  |  (53.3%)  |  (14,183)  |  (19,889)  |  (28.7%)   \n(-) Additions of intangible assets  |  (22,080)  |  (21,376)  |  3.3%  |  (100,723)  |  (83,783)  |  20.2%   \n(-) Lease liabilities paid  |  (3,787)  |  (3,584)  |  5.7%  |  (16,017)  |  (20,512)  |  (21.9%)   \nFree cash flow (FCF)  |  38,446  |  94,193  |  (59.2%)  |  90,438  |  87,184  |  3.7%   \nFCF/Adjusted EBITDA  |  148.3%  |  231.7%  |  (83.4p.p.)  |  21.1%  |  23.4%  |  (2.3p.p.)   \nLTM FCF/Adjusted EBITDA  |  31.9%  |  26.4%  |  5.5p.p.  |  31.9%  |  26.4%  |  5.5p.p.   \n  \n(1) Net (loss) profit less non-cash items less and changes in working capital.

In the 2024 sales cycle to date, FCF totaled R$90 million, a R$3 million or 3.7% increase from R$87 million 2023. The second quarter was negatively impacted by two main effects: (1) the anticipation of marketing expenses and (2) increased payments related to the 2023 production costs owing to a seasonal effect of paper and printing purchases. Accordingly, we foresee a lower volume of production-related payments in the following quarters and expect to maintain improvement in FCF for the year-end. \n\nThe last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate improved from 26.4% to 31.9% as a result of Vasta’s growth and implementation of sustained efficiency measures, for example: improve receivables management, enforcing credit policies and negotiate better payment terms. \n\n** Financial leverage **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  2Q24  |  1Q24  |  4Q23  |  3Q23  |  2Q23   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nFinancial debt  |  768,459  |  762,985  |  791,763  |  765,350  |  846,443   \nAccounts payable from business combinations  |  618,830  |  616,247  |  614,120  |  601,171  |  591,620   \nTotal debt  |  1,387,289  |  1,379,232  |  1,405,883  |  1,366,521  |  1,438,063   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  50,868  |  67,214  |  95,864  |  106,757  |  38,268   \nMarketable securities  |  272,991  |  242,799  |  245,942  |  261,264  |  385,002   \nNet debt  |  1,063,430  |  1,069,219  |  1,064,076  |  998,500  |  1,014,793   \nNet debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA  |  2.28  |  2.22  |  2.36  |  2.43  |  2.57   \n  \nAs of the end of 2Q24, Vasta had a net debt position of R$1,063 million, a R$6 million decrease compared to 1Q24.

This report, which is the company's second, was prepared in accordance with international standards for reports of this category and showcases the implementation of our corporate strategy, challenges, and achievements, while also reaffirming our commitment to transparency and sustainability. These include the publication of its first Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the company's adherence to the UN Global Compact, the dedication of 3,216 thousand hours to the Corporate Volunteer Program, the SOMOS Afro program, an affirmative internship program, and the fact that 29% of the seats on the Board of Directors are occupied by women. \n\nThe report complies with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 version and also considers other standards recognized in Brazil and abroad, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines for the education sector, the guidelines of the IBC Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics from the World Economic Forum, and the principles of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). \n\nThe document is available at: [https://ir.vastaplatform.com/esg/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.vastaplatform.com%2Fesg%2F&esheet=54106172&newsitemid=20240807558734&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.vastaplatform.com%2Fesg%2F&index=1&md5=e6cd1165846d3f3aca91930d8895bb2d) .

During this period, we hired 26 black employees, 1 person with a disability, and 1 woman for a managerial position and above. Additionally, to support leadership and ensure appropriate, inclusive, and non-discriminatory interview processes, we created a Manager's Guide, which includes a module on Diversity and Inclusion. \n\nIn May, we held a live session together with the Compliance department to talk about the fight against LGBTphobia and to reinforce our Code of Ethics and Whistleblower Channel. During LGBTQIAPN+ Pride Month in June, we brought the company together for another live session with two employees representing the interest group to share their experiences and discuss a respectful and welcoming environment, as well as to reinforce our commitment to the inclusion of community members within the Company. \n\n**Social impact* 8 **  \n---  \n**SDGs** |  **GRI** |  **Disclosure** |  **Unit** |  **1S2024** |  **1S2023** |  **2S2023**  \n**4, 10** |  **-** |  Scholars of the Somos Futuro Program  |  no.  |  195  |  236  |  232   \n  \n* Indicators presented progressively, referring to the total accumulated since the beginning of the year, which is why we are not presenting the variations compared to previous semesters. \n\nWe continue to maintain the Somos Futuro Program via Instituto SOMOS.

Another initiative in 2Q24 was the Cogna group's 2nd Mega SIPAT, during which we covered strategic topics for the business, such as: Health and Safety Policy and Near Miss Reporting; Mental Health in the Digital Age; Spine Care; Harassment and Forms of Violence; and the Art of Identifying Hidden Risks in Everyday Situations.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are among the key performance indicators used by us to measure financial operating performance. Our management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders. We also use these measures internally to establish budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, evaluate our underlying historical performance and business strategies and to report our results to the board of directors. \n\nWe calculate EBITDA as net (loss) profit for the period/year plus income taxes and social contribution plus/minus net finance result plus depreciation and amortization. The EBITDA measure provides useful information to assess our operational performance. \n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus/minus: (a) income tax and social contribution; (b) net finance result; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) share-based compensation expenses, mainly due to the grant of additional shares to Somos’ employees in connection with the change of control of Somos to Cogna (for further information refer to note 23 to the audited consolidated financial statements) ; (e) provision for risks of tax, civil and labor losses regarding penalties, related to income tax positions taken by the Predecessor Somos – Anglo and Vasta in connection with a corporate reorganization carried out by the Predecessor Somos – Anglo; (f) Bonus IPO, which refers to bonus paid to certain executives and employees based on restricted share units; and (g) expenses with contractual termination of employees due to organizational restructuring. We understand that such adjustments are relevant and should be considered when calculating our Adjusted EBITDA, which is a practical measure to assess our operational performance that allows us to compare it with other companies that operates in the same segment. \n\nWe calculate Adjusted net (loss) profit as the (loss) profit for the period/year as presented in Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income adjusted by the same Adjusted EBITDA items, however, added by (a) Amortization of intangible assets from Business Combination and (b) Tax shield of 34% generated by the aforementioned adjustments. \n\nWe calculate Free cash flow (FCF) as the cash from operating activities as presented in the Statement of Cash Flows less (a) income tax and social contribution paid; (b) tax, civil and labor proceedings paid; (c) interest lease liabilities paid; (d) acquisition of property, plant and equipment; (e) additions to intangible assets; and (f) lease liabilities paid. \n\nWe understand that, although Adjusted net (loss) profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow (FCF) are used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. Additionally, our calculations of Adjusted net (loss) profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow (FCF) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including our competitors in the education services industry, and therefore, our measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. \n\n**REVENUE RECOGNITION AND SEASONALITY**\n\nOur main deliveries of printed and digital materials to our customers occur in the last quarter of each year (typically in November and December), and in the first quarter of each subsequent year (typically in February and March), and revenue is recognized when the customers obtain control over the materials. In addition, the printed and digital materials we provide in the fourth quarter are used by our customers in the following school year and, therefore, our fourth quarter results reflect the growth in the number of our students from one school year to the next, leading to higher revenue in general in our fourth quarter compared with the preceding quarters in each year. Consequently, in aggregate, the seasonality of our revenues generally produces higher revenues in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Thus, the numbers for the second quarter and third quarter are usually less relevant. In addition, we generally bill our customers during the first half of each school year (which starts in January), which generally results in a higher cash position in the first half of each year compared to the second half. \n\nA significant part of our expenses is also seasonal. Due to the nature of our business cycle, we need significant working capital, typically in September or October of each year, to cover costs related to production and inventory accumulation, selling and marketing expenses, and delivery of our teaching materials at the end of each year in preparation for the beginning of each school year. As a result, these operating expenses are generally incurred between September and December of each year. \n\nPurchases through our Livro Fácil e-commerce platform are also very intense during the back-to-school period, between November, when school enrollment takes place and families plan to anticipate the purchase of products and services, and February of the following year, when classes are about to start. Thus, e-commerce revenue is mainly concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year. \n\n**KEY BUSINESS METRICS**\n\nAnnual Contract Value, or ACV, is a non-accounting managerial metric and represents our partner schools’ commitment to pay for our solutions offerings. We believe it is a meaningful indicator of demand for our solutions. We consider ACV is a helpful metric because it is designed to show amounts that we expect to be recognized as revenue from subscription services for the 12-month period between October 1 of one fiscal year through September 30 of the following fiscal year. We define ACV as the revenue we would expect to recognize from a partner school in each school year, based on the number of students who have contracted our services, or “enrolled students,” that will access our content at such partner school in such school year. We calculate ACV by multiplying the number of enrolled students at each school with the average ticket per student per year; the related number of enrolled students and average ticket per student per year are each calculated in accordance with the terms of each contract with the related school. Although our contracts with our schools are typically for 4-year terms, we record one year of revenue under such contracts as ACV. ACV is calculated based on the sum of actual contracts signed during the sales period and assumes the historical rates of returned goods from customers for the preceding 24-month period. Since the actual rates of returned goods from sales during the period may be different from the historical average rates and the actual volume of merchandise ordered by our customers may be different from the contracted amount, the actual revenue recognized during each period of a sales cycle may be different from the ACV for the respective sales cycle. Our reported ACV is subject to risks associated with, among other things, economic conditions and the markets in which we operate, including risks that our contracts may be canceled or adjusted (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). \n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**Consolidated Statements of Financial Position**  \n---  \n**Assets** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Current assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  50,868  |  95,864   \nMarketable securities  |  272,991  |  245,942   \nTrade receivables  |  661,590  |  697,512   \nInventories  |  289,421  |  300,509   \nTaxes recoverable  |  19,743  |  19,041   \nIncome tax and social contribution recoverable  |  12,026  |  16,841   \nPrepayments  |  82,228  |  71,870   \nOther receivables  |  1,516  |  2,085   \nRelated parties – other receivables  |  10,989  |  7,157   \n**Total current assets** |  **1,401,372** |  **1,456,821**  \n**Non-current assets**  \nJudicial deposits  |  218,736  |  207,188   \nDeferred income tax and social contribution  |  221,098  |  205,453   \nEquity accounted investees  |  57,456  |  64,484   \nOther investments and interests in entities  |  9,879  |  9,879   \nProperty, plant and equipment  |  144,046  |  151,492   \nIntangible assets and goodwill  |  5,246,584  |  5,307,563   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **5,897,799** |  **5,946,059**  \n**Total Assets** |  **7,299,171** |  **7,402,880**  \n  \n**Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (continued)**  \n---  \n**Liabilities** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Current liabilities**  \nBonds  |  21,536  |  541,763   \nSuppliers  |  206,893  |  221,291   \nReverse factoring  |  257,536  |  263,948   \nLease liabilities  |  14,544  |  17,078   \nIncome tax and social contribution payable  |  2,314  |  -

Financial results are expressed in Brazilian Reais and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Vasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$1,358 million, a 12.5% increase compared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle. In 3Q24, subscription revenue totaled R$206 million, a 5.7% increase compared to 3Q23. The Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings delivered in the 2024 sales cycle was slightly higher than previously disclosed estimates. Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of the last 5 cycles was a positive 18.4%, which demonstrates our resilience and capacity to keep our growth in higher double digits for several years. \n  * In the 2024 sales cycle (which commenced 4Q23 through 3Q24), net revenue increased 6.4% to R$1,529 million compared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle, mostly due to higher conversion of ACV into revenue, being partially offset by lower revenue in the non-subscription segment. In 3Q24, net revenue totaled R$220 million, a 14.6% decrease compared to the previous year, due to lack of new revenues from our public-school sector (“B2G”) segment in this quarter, caused largely by prioritization of municipal elections by the public sector. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the 2024 sales cycle grew by 9.2% to R$449 million compared to R$411 million in previous sales cycle, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin grew to 29.4%, from 28.6% in the same period of the last year, which represents an increase of 0.8p.p. compared to the 2023 sales cycle. This increase was mainly driven by gains in operating efficiency, cost savings and a better product mix that benefited from premium products expansion. In 3Q24, Adjusted EBITDA totaled R$21 million, a 45.3% decrease compared to R$39 million in 3Q23, mainly due to lower net revenues in the quarter. \n  * Vasta recorded an Adjusted Net Profit of R$62 million in the 2024 sales cycle, a 71.4% increase compared to R$36 million in the previous sales cycle, and an adjusted net margin increased 1.6p.p. compared to previous sales cycle, from 2.5% in 2023 to 4.1% in 2024. In 3Q24, Adjusted Net Loss totaled R$48 million, a 58.9% increase compared to Adjusted Net Loss of R$30 million in 3Q23. \n  * Free cash flow (FCF) totaled R$146 million in the 2024 sales cycle, slightly higher than R$145 million FCF in the 2023 sales cycle. In 3Q24 FCF totaled R$55 million, a 4.8% decrease from R$58 million in 3Q23. The last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate decreased from 35.4% to 32.5% due to higher investments in marketing for business expansion, and a higher volume of payments related to paper purchases. \n  * The Start Anglo bilingual school kept its growth with 2 new contracts, totaling 32 contracts signed as of this date, and 2 operating units. This growth reaffirms our quest for a bilingual education alongside academic excellence, which reinforces our strategic expansion into new revenue streams. Additionally, last month we held the reinauguration of the Liceu Complex in São Paulo, preserving its entire historical architectural design, which launched our flagship operations in São Paulo, to begin operations in 2025. \n\n\n\n**MESSAGE FROM MANAGEMENT**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we concluded the 2024 sales cycle (4Q23 to 3Q24). Our net revenue during the 2024 cycle has reached R$1,529 million, representing a 6.4% increase compared to the previous sales cycle, mostly due to the conversion of ACV into revenue. Additionally, our complementary solutions have seen an important growth of 20.9% compared to the 2023 sales cycle, with an accelerated increase in both student base and market penetration. \n\nVasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$1,358 million, a 12.5% increase compared to the previous sales cycle. The Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings expected for the 2024 sales cycle were delivered as expect and slightly higher than previous disclosed. Additionally, this line of revenue represents 88.8% of the total net revenue, a 4.8p.p. increase compared to the 2023 sales cycle, 84.0%. Subscription revenue continues to gain importance in the total revenue of the Company, in line with our strategy. CAGR for the last 5 cycles was a positive 18.4%, showing our resilience and the power of our brands and products. \n\nAnother highlight of the 2024 sales cycle has been that Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%, to R$449 million compared to R$411 million in the previous sales cycle, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 0.8 p.p. to 29.4%. In proportion to net revenue, gross margin increased 230 bps in the 2024 sales cycle (from 61.9% to 64.2%) mainly due to synergy gains, cost efficiency and a better product mix that benefited from premium products expansion. Adjusted G&A expenses were reduced by 80 bps driven by workforce optimization and budgetary discipline, and Commercial expenses increased by 230 bps driven by higher expenses related to business expansion and marketing investments. \n\nFree cashflow (FCF) in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$146 million, a 0.3% increase from R$145 million for the same period in 2023. The last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate decreased from 35.4% to 32.5%, due to higher investments in marketing for business expansion, and increased expenses relating to the 2023 production owing to a seasonal effect of paper and printing costs. However, we foresee a lower volume of production-related expenses in the following quarters and expect to maintain the improvement in FCF for the year-end. \n\nMoreover, the net debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA was 2.32x as of 3Q24, which represents a decrease of 0.11x from 2.43x, in the same quarter of 2023. In comparison to 2Q24 the net debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA increased slightly from 2.28x in 2Q24. The Company continues to focus on deleveraging and cash generation, which is highlighted by this indicator. In 2024, we implemented some liquidity management actions, which allowed us to extend the maturity profile of our indebtedness and reduce applicable interest rates. \n\nIn the B2G segment, one of our main growing avenues, Vasta generated R$ 69 million in revenues in this sales cycle, compared to R$81 million in the previous sales cycle. This is the second year since Vasta started offering its products and services to the public sector, and we remain confident in our strategy. We have renewed the contract signed in the previous year in the State of Pará and the SAEB scores were released showing a significant improvement in the students’ results in that state, moving from the second-to-last place in the National Ranking for High School to sixth place, with more than a 40% improvement in high school students’ scores. This is a remarkable result for us, the State of Pará and mainly for the students who benefited from the best products for recompositing learning and core-skill developments. \n\nGiven municipal elections in Brazilian cities in 2024, the signing of new contracts was hindered, but Vasta still has a strong pipeline and remains confident that this line of business will bear fruit in the coming quarters for the Company. \n\nStart-Anglo bilingual school, which is part of our growth strategy, remains in continued expansion. In 3Q24, we entered 2 new contracts, totaling 32 contracts as of this date, and 2 operating units. Furthermore, we have over 260 prospects in negotiation. We believe that the broad geographic presence and strong pipeline underscore the robust potential for further growth and market penetration of Start-Anglo. \n\nOur revenue growth is directly related to the delivery of high-quality solutions that meet the needs of students, parents, educators and partner schools. Great evidence of the evolution of our company and brands is demonstrated in the customer satisfaction assessment index (NPS), which in the last 12 months has grown by more than 30 points. \n\n**OPERATING PERFORMANCE**\n\n** Student base – subscription models **  \n---  \n2024  |  2023  |  % Y/Y  |  2022  |  % Y/Y   \nPartner schools - Core content  |  4,744  |  5,032  |  (5.7%)  |  5,274  |  (4.6%)   \nPartner schools – Complementary solutions  |  1,722  |  1,383  |  24.5%  |  1,304  |  6.1%   \nStudents - Core content  |  1,432,289  |  1,539,024  |  (6.9%)  |  1,589,224  |  (3.2%)   \nStudents - Complementary content  |  483,132  |  453,552  |  6.5%  |  372,559  |  21.7%   \nNote: Students enrolled in partner schools   \n  \nIn the 2024 sales cycle, Vasta served 1.4 million students with core content solutions and close to 500,000 students with complementary solutions. This is aligned with the company’s strategy to focus on improving its client base through a better mix of schools and growth in premium education systems (Anglo, PH, Amplia and Fibonacci), brands with higher average ticket, lower defaults, greater adoption of complementary solutions and longer-term relationships. On the other hand, the reduction of our client base was concentrated on the low-end segment, which has a higher number of students on average, and a lower margin. \n\n**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**\n\n** Net revenue **  \n---  \n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  3Q24  |  3Q23  |  % Y/Y  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  % Y/Y   \nSubscription  |  205,874  |  194,841  |  5.7%  |  1,357,880  |  1,207,155  |  12.5%   \nCore content  |  199,262  |  190,607  |  4.5%  |  1,167,082  |  1,049,358  |  11.2%   \nComplementary solutions  |  6,612  |  4,234  |  56.2%  |  190,798  |  157,797  |  20.9%   \nB2G  |  -  |  40,747  |  (100.0%)  |  69,031  |  81,199  |  (15.0%)   \nNon-subscription  |  14,319  |  22,346  |  (35.9%)  |  102,458  |  148,829  |  (31.2%)   \nTotal net revenue  |  220,193  |  257,933  |  (14.6%)  |  1,529,369  |  1,437,183  |  6.4%   \n% ACV  |  15.2%  |  15.8%  |  (0.6p.p.)  |  100.6%  |  98.1%  |  2.5p.p.   \n% Subscription  |  93.5%  |  75.5%  |  18.0p.p.  |  88.8%  |  84.0%  |  4.8p.p.   \nNote: n.m.: not meaningful   \n  \nIn 3Q24, Vasta’s net revenue totaled R$220 million, a 14.6% decrease compared to 3Q23, mainly due to the lack of new revenues in the B2G segment in this quarter.

In the 2024 sales cycle, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was mainly driven by gains in operating efficiency, cost savings and a sales mix that benefited from the growth of subscription products, partially offset by higher commercial expenses due to marketing events and campaigns for the next cycle. Share of loss equity-accounted investees relates to a 43.1% minority stake in Educbank Gestão de Pagamentos Educacionais S.A. (“Educbank”), which registered a loss in equity-accounted investees in the amount of R$20 million in the 2024 sales cycle that was mainly due to write-off costs relating to a potential M&A target of Educbank, which ultimately did not materialize. \n\n_(%) Net Revenue_ |  3Q24  |  3Q23  |  Y/Y (p.p.)  |  2024 cycle  |  2023 cycle  |  Y/Y (p.p.)   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGross margin  |  63.1%  |  60.8%  |  2.4p.p.  |  64.2%  |  61.9%  |  2.3p.p.   \nAdjusted cash G&A expenses (1) |  (21.0%)  |  (15.3%)  |  (5.7p.p.)  |  (12.7%)  |  (13.5%)  |  0.8p.p.   \nCommercial expenses  |  (28.9%)  |  (24.4%)  |  (4.5p.p.)  |  (18.2%)  |  (15.9%)  |  (2.3p.p.)   \nImpairment on trade receivables  |  (3.6%)  |  (6.0%)  |  2.3p.p.  |  (3.9%)  |  (3.9%)  |  0.0p.p.   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  9.7%  |  15.1%  |  (5.4p.p.)  |  29.4%  |  28.6%  |  0.8p.p.   \n(1) Sum of general and administrative expenses, other operating income and profit (loss) of equity-accounted investees, less: depreciation and amortization, layoffs related to internal restructuring, share-based compensation plan and M&A one-off adjusting expenses.   \n  \nIn proportion to net revenue, gross margin increased 230 bps in the 2024 sales cycle (from 62% to 64%) mainly due to synergy gains, costs efficiency and a better product mix that benefited from premium products expansion.

However, we foresee a lower volume of production-related expenses in the following quarters and expect to maintain improvement in FCF for the year-end. \n\n** Financial leverage **\n\n_Values in R$ ‘000_ |  3Q24  |  2Q24  |  1Q24  |  4Q23  |  3Q23   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nFinancial debt  |  764,693  |  768,459  |  762,985  |  791,763  |  765,350   \nAccounts payable from business combinations  |  630,267  |  618,830  |  616,247  |  614,120  |  601,171   \nTotal debt  |  1,394,960  |  1,387,289  |  1,379,232  |  1,405,883  |  1,366,521   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  96,162  |  50,868  |  67,214  |  95,864  |  106,757   \nMarketable securities  |  258,945  |  272,991  |  242,799  |  245,942  |  261,264   \nNet debt  |  1,039,853  |  1,063,430  |  1,069,219  |  1,064,076  |  998,500   \nNet debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA  |  2.32  |  2.28  |  2.22  |  2.36  |  2.43   \n  \nAs of the end of 3Q24, Vasta had a net debt position of R$1,040 million, a R$23 million decrease compared to 2Q24.

These include the publication of its second Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the company's adherence to the UN Global Compact, the dedication of 1,991 thousand hours to the Corporate Volunteer Program, the SOMOS Afro program, an affirmative internship program, and the fact that 29% of the seats on the Board of Directors are occupied by women. \n\nThe report complies with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 version and considers other standards recognized in Brazil and abroad, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines for the education sector, the guidelines of the IBC Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics from the World Economic Forum, and the principles of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). \n\nThe document is available at: [https://ir.vastaplatform.com/esg/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.vastaplatform.com%2Fesg%2F&esheet=54149312&newsitemid=20241107130407&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.vastaplatform.com%2Fesg%2F&index=1&md5=0101643c00d6d94323125c0a876dec9d).

There was also an increase in energy consumption compared to the same period in 2023, due to greater use of air conditioning resulting from the temperature increase that affected much of the country. \n\n**SOCIAL**  \n---  \n**Diversity in workforce by employee category**  \n**SDGs** |  **GRI** |  **Disclosure** |  **Unit** |  **3Q2024** |  **3Q2023** |  **% HA** |  **2Q2024** |  **% HA**  \n5  |  405-1  |  C-level – Women  |  %  |  22%  |  29%  |  (7 p.p.)  |  29%  |  (7 p.p.)   \nC-level – Men  |  %  |  78%  |  71%  |  7 p.p.  |  71%  |  7 p.p.   \nC-level- total 4 |  no.  |  9  |  7  |  29%  |  7  |  29%   \nLeadership (≥ managers) – Women  |  %  |  44%  |  45%  |  (1 p.p.)  |  43%  |  1 p.p.   \nTotal - Leadership (≥ managers) – Men  |  %  |  56%  |  55%  |  1 p.p.  |  57%  |  (1 p.p.)   \nLeadership (≥ managers)  5 – total  |  no.  |  120  |  144  |  (17%)  |  124  |  (3%)   \nAcademic staff – Women  |  %  |  17%  |  18%  |  (1 p.p.)  |  15%  |  2 p.p.   \nAcademic staff – Men  |  %  |  83%  |  83%  |  0 p.p.  |  85%  |  (2 p.p.)   \nAcademic staff  6 - total  |  no.  |  78  |  80  |  (3%)  |  75  |  4%   \nAdministrative/Operational – Women  |  %  |  53%  |  55%  |  (2 p.p.)  |  54%  |  (1 p.p.)   \nAdministrative/Operational – Male  |  %  |  47%  |  45%  |  2 p.p.  |  46%  |  1 p.p.   \nAdministrative/Operational 7 - total  |  no.  |  1,226  |  1,564  |  (22%)  |  1,229  |  (0%)   \nEmployees – Women  |  %  |  50%  |  53%  |  (3 p.p.)  |  51%  |  (1 p.p.)   \nEmployees – Men  |  %  |  50%  |  47%  |  3 p.p.  |  49%  |  1 p.p.   \nEmployees - total  |  no.  |  1,433  |  1,795  |  (20%)  |  1,435  |  (0%)   \n  \nContinuing our Diversity and Inclusion actions, in July we held a dialogue with our LGBTQIAPN+ people to discuss their experiences in the job market and in the company. In addition, we published communications encouraging self-declaration of sexual orientation and gender identity, so that more people may feel encouraged to self-identify. This month, we also promoted and encouraged our professionals to take the Ethnic-Racial Diversity course at the Corporate University. \n\nIn September 2024, we celebrated the Month of People with Disabilities with a live event involving our professionals with disabilities. This initiative also promoted the UniCo course on Inclusion of People with Disabilities and reinforced the self-declaration campaign. \n\nAnother important highlight of September 2024 is that we became signatories of the Movement for Racial Equity (MOVER), a non-profit association made up of more than 50 companies that together employ more than 1.3 million workers. The movement works collaboratively to ensure that Black people have access to more opportunities in the job market. \n\n**Social impact** ***** 8  \n---  \n**SDGs** |  **GRI** |  **Disclosure** |  **Unit** |  **2S2024** |  **2S2023** |  **1S2024**  \n**4, 10** |  **-** |  Scholars of the Somos Futuro Program  |  no.  |  213  |  232  |  195   \n  \n* Indicators presented progressively, referring to the total accumulated since the beginning of the year, which is why we are not presenting the variations compared to previous semesters. \n\nWe continue to maintain the Somos Futuro Program via Instituto SOMOS.

In this quarter, 213 young people were studying through the program receiving didactic and paradidactic material, online school tutoring, mentoring and access to the entire support network of the program, which includes psychological monitoring, in addition to the scholarship offered by the school. \n\n**Health and Safety**  \n---  \n**SDGs** |  **GRI** |  **Disclosure** |  **Unit** |  **3Q2024** |  **3Q2023** |  **% HA** |  **2Q2024** |  **% HA**  \n**3** |  **403-5, 403-9** |  Units covered by the Risk Management Program (PGR)  |  %  |  100%  |  100%  |  0 p.p.  |  100%  |  0 p.p.   \nTrained employees  |  no.  |  214  |  781  |  (73%)  |  221  |  (3%)   \nAverage hours of training per employee  9 |  no.  |  2.07  |  1.25  |  66%  |  3.00  |  (31%)   \nInjury frequency 10 |  rate  |  1.16  |  4.58  |  (75%)  |  1.09  |  6%   \nHigh-consequence injuries  |  no.  |  -  |  -  |  0%  |  -  |  0%   \nRecordable work-related injuries 11 |  rate  |  -  |  -  |  0%  |  -  |  0%   \nFatalities resulted from work-related injuries  |  no.  |  -  |  -  |  0%  |  -  |  0%   \nFatalities 12 |  rate  |  -  |  -  |  0%  |  -  |  0%   \n  \nThe difference in employees trained between 3Q24 and 3Q23 is due to the fact that in May 2023 we implemented an automatic process to send reminders to employees who had not taken the mandatory courses on occupational health and safety available at our corporate university. \n\nDuring the period, the main accidents involving employees occurred in internal circulation areas, resulting in falls on staircases, as well as accidents in administrative areas and laboratories involving furniture. Workplace inspections were carried out to identify risk situations and implement preventive plans. \n\nIn 3Q24, we promoted health actions, events, and lives, including the \"Momento Espaço Saúde\" in the offices and blood donation campaigns. We sent out a notice advising employees and students on how to act in emergency situations. We also publicized the procedure for the Mental Health Day and made Mental Health training available at the Corporate University for all employees.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are among the key performance indicators used by us to measure financial operating performance. Our management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders. We also use these measures internally to establish budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, evaluate our underlying historical performance and business strategies and to report our results to the board of directors. \n\nWe calculate EBITDA as net (loss) profit for the period/year plus income taxes and social contribution plus/minus net finance result plus depreciation and amortization. The EBITDA measure provides useful information to assess our operational performance. \n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus/minus: (a) income tax and social contribution; (b) net finance result; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) share-based compensation expenses, mainly due to the grant of additional shares to Somos’ employees in connection with the change of control of Somos to Cogna (for further information refer to note 23 to the audited consolidated financial statements) ; (e) provision for risks of tax, civil and labor losses regarding penalties, related to income tax positions taken by the Predecessor Somos – Anglo and Vasta in connection with a corporate reorganization carried out by the Predecessor Somos – Anglo; (f) Bonus IPO, which refers to bonus paid to certain executives and employees based on restricted share units; and (g) expenses with contractual termination of employees due to organizational restructuring. We understand that such adjustments are relevant and should be considered when calculating our Adjusted EBITDA, which is a practical measure to assess our operational performance that allows us to compare it with other companies that operates in the same segment. \n\nWe calculate Adjusted net (loss) profit as the (loss) profit for the period/year as presented in Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income adjusted by the same Adjusted EBITDA items, however, added by (a) Amortization of intangible assets from Business Combination and (b) Tax shield of 34% generated by the aforementioned adjustments. \n\nWe calculate Free cash flow (FCF) as the cash from operating activities as presented in the Statement of Cash Flows less (a) income tax and social contribution paid; (b) tax, civil and labor proceedings paid; (c) interest lease liabilities paid; (d) acquisition of property, plant and equipment; (e) additions to intangible assets; and (f) lease liabilities paid. \n\nWe understand that, although Adjusted net (loss) profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow (FCF) are used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. Additionally, our calculations of Adjusted net (loss) profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow (FCF) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including our competitors in the education services industry, and therefore, our measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. \n\n**REVENUE RECOGNITION AND SEASONALITY**\n\nOur main deliveries of printed and digital materials to our customers occur in the last quarter of each year (typically in November and December), and in the first quarter of each subsequent year (typically in February and March), and revenue is recognized when the customers obtain control over the materials. In addition, the printed and digital materials we provide in the fourth quarter are used by our customers in the following school year and, therefore, our fourth quarter results reflect the growth in the number of our students from one school year to the next, leading to higher revenue in general in our fourth quarter compared with the preceding quarters in each year. Consequently, in aggregate, the seasonality of our revenues generally produces higher revenues in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Thus, the numbers for the second quarter and third quarter are usually less relevant. In addition, we generally bill our customers during the first half of each school year (which starts in January), which generally results in a higher cash position in the first half of each year compared to the second half. \n\nA significant part of our expenses is also seasonal. Due to the nature of our business cycle, we need significant working capital, typically in September or October of each year, to cover costs related to production and inventory accumulation, selling and marketing expenses, and delivery of our teaching materials at the end of each year in preparation for the beginning of each school year. As a result, these operating expenses are generally incurred between September and December of each year. \n\nPurchases through our Livro Fácil e-commerce platform are also very intense during the back-to-school period, between November, when school enrollment takes place and families plan to anticipate the purchase of products and services, and February of the following year, when classes are about to start. Thus, e-commerce revenue is mainly concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year. \n\n**KEY BUSINESS METRICS**\n\nAnnual Contract Value, or ACV, is a non-accounting managerial metric and represents our partner schools’ commitment to pay for our solutions offerings. We believe it is a meaningful indicator of demand for our solutions. We consider ACV is a helpful metric because it is designed to show amounts that we expect to be recognized as revenue from subscription services for the 12-month period between October 1 of one fiscal year through September 30 of the following fiscal year. We define ACV as the revenue we would expect to recognize from a partner school in each school year, based on the number of students who have contracted our services, or “enrolled students,” that will access our content at such partner school in such school year. We calculate ACV by multiplying the number of enrolled students at each school with the average ticket per student per year; the related number of enrolled students and average ticket per student per year are each calculated in accordance with the terms of each contract with the related school. Although our contracts with our schools are typically for 4-year terms, we record one year of revenue under such contracts as ACV. ACV is calculated based on the sum of actual contracts signed during the sales period and assumes the historical rates of returned goods from customers for the preceding 24-month period. Since the actual rates of returned goods from sales during the period may be different from the historical average rates and the actual volume of merchandise ordered by our customers may be different from the contracted amount, the actual revenue recognized during each period of a sales cycle may be different from the ACV for the respective sales cycle. Our reported ACV is subject to risks associated with, among other things, economic conditions and the markets in which we operate, including risks that our contracts may be canceled or adjusted (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). \n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **Consolidated Statements of Financial Position**  \n---  \n**Assets** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Current assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  96,162  |  95,864   \nMarketable securities  |  258,945  |  245,942   \nTrade receivables  |  477,125  |  697,512   \nInventories  |  334,815  |  300,509   \nTaxes recoverable  |  20,122  |  19,041   \nIncome tax and social contribution recoverable  |  13,477  |  16,841   \nPrepayments  |  84,801  |  71,870   \nOther receivables  |  1,528  |  2,085   \nRelated parties – other receivables  |  10,520  |  7,157   \n**Total current assets** |  **1,297,495** |  **1,456,821**  \n**Non-current assets**  \nJudicial deposits  |  224,210  |  207,188   \nDeferred income tax and social contribution  |  253,834  |  205,453   \nEquity accounted investees  |  54,765  |  64,484   \nOther investments and interests in entities  |  9,879  |  9,879   \nProperty, plant and equipment  |  155,406  |  151,492   \nIntangible assets and goodwill  |  5,205,092  |  5,307,563   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **5,903,186** |  **5,946,059**  \n**Total Assets** |  **7,200,681** |  **7,402,880**  \n  \n**Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (continued)**  \n---  \n**Liabilities** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Current liabilities**  \nBonds  |  267,471  |  541,763   \nSuppliers  |  141,840  |  221,291   \nReverse factoring  |  274,239  |  263,948   \nLease liabilities  |  19,145  |  17,078   \nIncome tax and social contribution payable  |  1,005  |  -

          "content": "São Paulo, November 7, 2024 – Vasta Platform Limited (NASDAQ: VSTA) – “Vasta” or the “Company” announces\ntoday its financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2024 (3Q24) ended September 30, 2024. Financial results\nare expressed in Brazilian Reais and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nHIGHLIGHTS\nVasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$1,358 million, a 12.5% increase\ncompared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle. In 3Q24, subscription revenue totaled R$206 million, a\n5.7% increase compared to 3Q23. The Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings delivered in the 2024 sales\ncycle was slightly higher than previously disclosed estimates. Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of the\nlast 5 cycles was a positive 18.4%, which demonstrates our resilience and capacity to keep our growth in higher\ndouble digits for several years.\nIn the 2024 sales cycle (which commenced 4Q23 through 3Q24), net revenue increased 6.4% to R$1,529\nmillion compared to the same period of the 2023 sales cycle, mostly due to higher conversion of ACV into\nrevenue, being partially offset by lower revenue in the non-subscription segment. In 3Q24, net revenue totaled\nR$220 million, a 14.6% decrease compared to the previous year, due to lack of new revenues from our public-\nschool sector (“B2G”) segment in this quarter, caused largely by prioritization of municipal elections by the public\nsector.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the 2024 sales cycle grew by 9.2% to R$449 million compared to R$411 million in previous\nsales cycle, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin grew to 29.4%, from 28.6% in the same period of the last year, which\nrepresents an increase of 0.8p.p. compared to the 2023 sales cycle. This increase was mainly driven by gains\nin operating efficiency, cost savings and a better product mix that benefited from premium products expansion.\nIn 3Q24, Adjusted EBITDA totaled R$21 million, a 45.3% decrease compared to R$39 million in 3Q23, mainly\ndue to lower net revenues in the quarter.\nVasta recorded an Adjusted Net Profit of R$62 million in the 2024 sales cycle, a 71.4% increase compared to\nR$36 million in the previous sales cycle, and an adjusted net margin increased 1.6p.p. compared to previous\nsales cycle, from 2.5% in 2023 to 4.1% in 2024. In 3Q24, Adjusted Net Loss totaled R$48 million, a 58.9%\nincrease compared to Adjusted Net Loss of R$30 million in 3Q23.\nFree cash flow (FCF) totaled R$146 million in the 2024 sales cycle, slightly higher than R$145 million FCF in the\n2023 sales cycle. In 3Q24 FCF totaled R$55 million, a 4.8% decrease from R$58 million in 3Q23. The last twelve-\nmonth (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate decreased from 35.4% to 32.5% due to higher investments\nin marketing for business expansion, and a higher volume of payments related to paper purchases.\nThe Start Anglo bilingual school kept its growth with 2 new contracts, totaling 32 contracts signed as of this date,\nand 2 operating units. This growth reaffirms our quest for a bilingual education alongside academic excellence,\nwhich reinforces our strategic expansion into new revenue streams. Additionally, last month we held the\nreinauguration of the Liceu Complex in São Paulo, preserving its entire historical architectural design, which\nlaunched our flagship operations in São Paulo, to begin operations in 2025.\n1\nMESSAGE FROM MANAGEMENT\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we concluded the 2024 sales cycle (4Q23 to 3Q24). Our net revenue during the 2024 cycle\nhas reached R$1,529 million, representing a 6.4% increase compared to the previous sales cycle, mostly due to the\nconversion of ACV into revenue. Additionally, our complementary solutions have seen an important growth of 20.9%\ncompared to the 2023 sales cycle, with an accelerated increase in both student base and market penetration.\nVasta’s accumulated subscription revenue in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$1,358 million, a 12.5% increase compared\nto the previous sales cycle. The Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) bookings expected for the 2024 sales cycle were\ndelivered as expect and slightly higher than previous disclosed. Additionally, this line of revenue represents 88.8% of the\ntotal net revenue, a 4.8p.p. increase compared to the 2023 sales cycle, 84.0%. Subscription revenue continues to gain\nimportance in the total revenue of the Company, in line with our strategy. CAGR for the last 5 cycles was a positive\n18.4%, showing our resilience and the power of our brands and products.\nAnother highlight of the 2024 sales cycle has been that Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%, to R$449 million compared to\nR$411 million in the previous sales cycle, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 0.8 p.p. to 29.4%. In proportion to\nnet revenue, gross margin increased 230 bps in the 2024 sales cycle (from 61.9% to 64.2%) mainly due to synergy\ngains, cost efficiency and a better product mix that benefited from premium products expansion. Adjusted G&A expenses\nwere reduced by 80 bps driven by workforce optimization and budgetary discipline, and Commercial expenses increased\nby 230 bps driven by higher expenses related to business expansion and marketing investments.\nFree cashflow (FCF) in the 2024 sales cycle totaled R$146 million, a 0.3% increase from R$145 million for the same\nperiod in 2023. The last twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion rate decreased from 35.4% to 32.5%,\ndue to higher investments in marketing for business expansion, and increased expenses relating to the 2023 production\nowing to a seasonal effect of paper and printing costs. However, we foresee a lower volume of production-related\nexpenses in the following quarters and expect to maintain the improvement in FCF for the year-end.\nMoreover, the net debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA was 2.32x as of 3Q24, which represents a decrease of 0.11x from 2.43x,\nin the same quarter of 2023. In comparison to 2Q24 the net debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA increased slightly from 2.28x in\n2Q24. The Company continues to focus on deleveraging and cash generation, which is highlighted by this indicator. In\n2024, we implemented some liquidity management actions, which allowed us to extend the maturity profile of our\nindebtedness and reduce applicable interest rates.\nIn the B2G segment, one of our main growing avenues, Vasta generated R$ 69 million in revenues in this sales cycle,\ncompared to R$81 million in the previous sales cycle. This is the second year since Vasta started offering its products\nand services to the public sector, and we remain confident in our strategy. We have renewed the contract signed in the\nprevious year in the State of Pará and the SAEB scores were released showing a significant improvement in the students’\nresults in that state, moving from the second-to-last place in the National Ranking for High School to sixth place, with\nmore than a 40% improvement in high school students’ scores. This is a remarkable result for us, the State of Pará and\nmainly for the students who benefited from the best products for recompositing learning and core-skill developments.\nGiven municipal elections in Brazilian cities in 2024, the signing of new contracts was hindered, but Vasta still has a\nstrong pipeline and remains confident that this line of business will bear fruit in the coming quarters for the Company.\nStart-Anglo bilingual school, which is part of our growth strategy, remains in continued expansion. In 3Q24, we entered\n2 new contracts, totaling 32 contracts as of this date, and 2 operating units. Furthermore, we have over 260 prospects\n2\nin negotiation. We believe that the broad geographic presence and strong pipeline underscore the robust potential for\nfurther growth and market penetration of Start-Anglo.\nOur revenue growth is directly related to the delivery of high-quality solutions that meet the needs of students, parents,\neducators and partner schools. Great evidence of the evolution of our company and brands is demonstrated in the\ncustomer satisfaction assessment index (NPS), which in the last 12 months has grown by more than 30 points.\n3\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE\nStudent base – subscription models\n2024 2023 % Y/Y 2022 % Y/Y\nPartner schools - Core content 4,744 5,032 (5.7%) 5,274 (4.6%)\nPartner schools – Complementary solutions 1,722 1,383 24.5% 1,304 6.1%\nStudents - Core content 1,432,289 1,539,024 (6.9%) 1,589,224 (3.2%)\nStudents - Complementary content 483,132 453,552 6.5% 372,559 21.7%\nNote: Students enrolled in partner schools\nIn the 2024 sales cycle, Vasta served 1.4 million students with core content solutions and close to 500,000 students with\ncomplementary solutions. This is aligned with the company’s strategy to focus on improving its client base through a\nbetter mix of schools and growth in premium education systems (Anglo, PH, Amplia and Fibonacci), brands with higher\naverage ticket, lower defaults, greater adoption of complementary solutions and longer-term relationships. On the other\nhand, the reduction of our client base was concentrated on the low-end segment, which has a higher number of students\non average, and a lower margin.\n4\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nNet revenue\nValues in R$ ‘000 3Q24 3Q23 % Y/Y 2024 cycle 2023 cycle % Y/Y\nSubscription 205,874 194,841 5.7% 1,357,880 1,207,155 12.5%\nCore content 199,262 190,607 4.5% 1,167,082 1,049,358 11.2%\nComplementary solutions 6,612 4,234 56.2% 190,798 157,797 20.9%\nB2G - 40,747 (100.0%) 69,031 81,199 (15.0%)\nNon-subscription 14,319 22,346 (35.9%) 102,458 148,829 (31.2%)\nTotal net revenue 220,193 257,933 (14.6%) 1,529,369 1,437,183 6.4%\n% ACV 15.2% 15.8% (0.6p.p.) 100.6% 98.1% 2.5p.p.\n% Subscription 93.5% 75.5% 18.0p.p. 88.8% 84.0% 4.8p.p.\nNote: n.m.: not meaningful\nIn 3Q24, Vasta’s net revenue totaled R$220 million, a 14.6% decrease compared to 3Q23, mainly due to the lack of new\nrevenues in the B2G segment in this quarter.

In the 2024 sales cycle, the increase\nin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was mainly driven by gains in operating efficiency, cost savings and a\nsales mix that benefited from the growth of subscription products, partially offset by higher commercial expenses due to\nmarketing events and campaigns for the next cycle.

Adjusted cash\nG&A expenses reduced by 80 bps driven by workforce optimization and budgetary discipline, and Commercial expenses\nincreased by 230 bps driven by higher expenses related to business expansion and marketing investments while\nimpairment on trade receivable (PDA) remained stable, even considering a more restrictive credit landscape.\nFinance Results\nValues in R$ ‘000 3Q24 3Q23 % Y/Y 2024 cycle 2023 cycle % Y/Y\nFinance income 16,836 19,511 (13.7%) 63,241 85,831 (26.3%)\nFinance costs (71,483) (74,966) (4.6%) (276,659) (307,569) (10.0%)\nTotal (54,647) (55,455) (1.5%) (213,418) (221,738) (3.8%)\nIn 3Q24, finance income totaled R$16.8 million, from R$19.5 million in 3Q23, due to the impact of lower interest rates on\nfinancial investments and marketable securities. In the 2024 sales cycle, finance income decreased 26.3% to R$63.2\nmillion from R$ 85.8 million in the prior sales cycle, due to the same reason as noted above and a non-recurring gain of\nR$10 million resulting from the reversal of interest on tax contingencies.\nFinance costs in 3Q24 decreased 4.6% to R$71,5 million, from R$75,0 million in 3Q23, due to the impact of lower interest\nrates on financial liabilities (mainly bonds, accounts payable on acquisition and contingencies), as noted above.

It is\nworth highlighting that 2Q and 3Q of every year represents about 30% of the total revenue of the year due to seasonality\nof product deliveries to our customers.

The FCF generated\nin the sales cycle was offset by the impacts of financial interest cost and Vasta’s second share repurchase program. The\nlast twelve-month (LTM) FCF/Adjusted EBITDA conversion decreased from 35.4% to 32.5%, mainly driven by negative\nimpacts of anticipation of marketing expenses, and increased expenses related to the 2023 production owing to a\nseasonal effect of paper and printing costs.

These include the publication of its second Greenhouse\nGas Inventory, the company's adherence to the UN Global Compact, the dedication of 1,991 thousand hours to the\nCorporate Volunteer Program, the SOMOS Afro program, an affirmative internship program, and the fact that 29% of the\nseats on the Board of Directors are occupied by women.\nThe report complies with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 version and considers other standards recognized in\nBrazil and abroad, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines for the education sector,\nthe guidelines of the IBC Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics from the World Economic Forum, and the principles of the\nInternational Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).\nThe document is available at: https://ir.vastaplatform.com/esg/.

In addition, we published communications encouraging self-declaration\nof sexual orientation and gender identity, so that more people may feel encouraged to self-identify. This month, we also\npromoted and encouraged our professionals to take the Ethnic-Racial Diversity course at the Corporate University.\nIn September 2024, we celebrated the Month of People with Disabilities with a live event involving our professionals with\ndisabilities. This initiative also promoted the UniCo course on Inclusion of People with Disabilities and reinforced the self-\ndeclaration campaign.\nAnother important highlight of September 2024 is that we became signatories of the Movement for Racial Equity (MOVER),\na non-profit association made up of more than 50 companies that together employ more than 1.3 million workers.

Workplace inspections were\ncarried out to identify risk situations and implement preventive plans.\nIn 3Q24, we promoted health actions, events, and lives, including the \"Momento Espaço Saúde\" in the offices and blood\ndonation campaigns. We sent out a notice advising employees and students on how to act in emergency situations. We also\npublicized the procedure for the Mental Health Day and made Mental Health training available at the Corporate University\nfor all employees. Additionally, we held SIPAT (Internal Week for the Prevention of Accidents at Work) at the Distribution\nCenter in São José dos Campos.\n11"
