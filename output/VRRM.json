Moreover, we are continuing to see a robust bid pipeline for automated enforcement programs in our Government Solutions business. Based on our year-to-date financial performance and anticipated outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS while increasing Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance to the upper-end of the range provided.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** : Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $225.6 million, an increase of 7% compared to $209.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Service revenue growth was 8%, driven by 11% growth in Commercial Services segment and 7% growth from our Government Solutions segment. Commercial Services revenue growth was due to increases in travel volume, product adoption and tolling activity, and the growth in Government Solutions service revenue was driven by the expansion of speed programs and maintenance programs. Parking Solutions service revenue declined by $0.7 million, or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023, as increased revenue from software as a service product offerings was offset by reduction in professional services related to parking management solutions.\n  * **Net income and Earnings Per Share (EPS)** : Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $34.7 million, or $0.21 per share, based on 167.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Net income for the comparable 2023 period was $30.3 million, or $0.18 per share, based on 169.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n  * **Adjusted EPS*** : Adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA*** : Adjusted EBITDA was $104.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $97.4 million for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% of total revenue for 2024 and 2023.\n  * **Net Cash Provided from Operations** : Cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $46.4 million from $62.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $108.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to timing considerations related to improved cash collections and other sources of working capital.\n  * **Adjusted Free Cash Flow*** : Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $85.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $52.0 million for the same period last year. There were no adjustments to Free Cash Flow in the third quarter of 2024 or 2023.\n\n\n\n*Non-GAAP measure; refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" further below for explanatory notes and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\nWe report our results of operations based on three operating segments:\n\n  * **Commercial Services** offers automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to rental car companies, fleet management companies and other large fleet owners.\n  * **Government Solutions** delivers automated safety solutions to municipalities, school districts and government agencies, including services and technology that enable photo enforcement cameras to detect and process traffic violations related to speed, red-light, school bus and city bus lane management.\n  * **Parking Solutions** provides an integrated suite of parking software, transaction processing and hardware solutions to universities, municipalities, parking operators, healthcare facilities and transportation hubs in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Segment Detail**\n\n  * The Commercial Services segment generated total revenue of $109.1 million, an 11% increase compared to $98.1 million in the same period in 2023. Segment profit was $72.9 million, a 12% increase from $65.3 million in the prior year period. The increases in revenue and segment profit compared to the prior year period resulted from increased travel volume and product adoption for our rental car company customers, growth in revenue contributed from processing violations, titles and registrations, and an increase in enrolled vehicles and higher tolling activity for our fleet management customers. The segment profit margin was 67% for the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023.\n  * The Government Solutions segment generated total revenue of $95.9 million, a 6% increase compared to $90.3 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was due to a 7% increase in service revenue over the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the expansion of speed programs and maintenance programs. The segment profit was $28.1 million in 2024 compared to $28.6 million in the prior year period with segment profit margins of 29% for 2024 and 32% for 2023. The decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses associated with enhancing customer-facing platforms and systems and increased selling, marketing and general expenses.\n  * The Parking Solutions segment generated total revenue of $20.6 million, a 4% decrease compared to $21.5 million in the same period in 2023 due to a reduction in service revenue and a decrease in one-time product sales compared to the prior year quarter. The segment profit was $3.7 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior year period with segment profit margins of 18% for 2024 and 16% for 2023. The increase in segment profit was primarily due to a decrease in cost of product sales, operating expenses, and selling and general expenses.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity** : As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $206.1 million, and we generated $108.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Net Debt and Net Leverage** : As of September 30, 2024, Net Debt was $844.0 million and Net Leverage was 2.2x, as compared to $918.3 million and 2.5x as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Share Repurchases** In October 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, accelerated share repurchase or privately negotiated transactions. On June 6, 2024, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with a stockholder, pursuant to which we repurchased, directly from the stockholder, 2.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $51.5 million. The repurchased shares were subsequently retired. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $48.5 million remains available under our authorized share repurchase program.\n\n**2024 Full Year Guidance** Any guidance that we provide is subject to change as a variety of factors can affect actual operating results. Certain of the factors that may impact our actual operating results are identified below in the safe harbor language included within Forward-Looking Statements of this press release.\n\nBased on our third quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming 2024 full year guidance for Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS and increasing Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the upper-end of the range.\n\n  * Total Revenue at the upper-end of the range of $865 million to $880 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA at the upper-end of the range of $395 million to $405 million\n  * Adjusted EPS at the upper-end of the range of $1.15 to $1.20\n  * Adjusted Free Cash Flow at the upper-end of the range of $155 million to $165 million\n  * Net Leverage of approximately 2.0x\n\n\n\n**Underlying Assumptions for 2024 Full Year Guidance**\n\n  * Weighted average fully diluted share count expected to be approximately 168 million shares for the full year 2024\n  * Effective tax rate (including state taxes) is expected to be 30%, with approximately $55 million in total cash taxes expected to be paid in 2024. The effective tax rate for Non-GAAP adjustments is provided in the Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Calculation of Adjusted EPS\n  * Depreciation and amortization expense expected to be approximately $110 million for 2024\n  * Total interest expense, net expected to be approximately $75 million, of which approximately $75 million is expected to be net cash interest paid\n  * Change in working capital (change in operating assets and liabilities) is expected to result in a use of cash of approximately $35 million for 2024, excluding the one-time $31.5 million PlusPass legal settlement costs\n  * Capital expenditures (purchases of installation and service parts and property and equipment) are expected to be approximately $75 million for 2024\n\n\n\nMoreover, we are also providing a preliminary view of our anticipated 2025 outlook in advance of providing guidance in our fourth quarter earnings call. At this time, we anticipate 2025 revenue growth at the low end of our long-term 6% to 8% guide we provided at our July 2022 investor day. Additionally, we expect growth in 2025 Adjusted EBITDA dollars to be in the low-to-mid single digits compared to 2024.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\n**Date:** October 31, 2024 **Time:** 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time **U.S. and Canadian Callers Dial-in:** 1-800-717-1738 **Outside of U.S. and Canada Dial-in:** 1-646-307-1865 for international callers **Request a return call:** Available by clicking on the following link and requesting a return call:  _[callme.viavid.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291845-1&h=732394212&u=https%3A%2F%2Femportal.ink%2F4eJnlj9&a=callme.viavid.com) _**Webcast Information:** Available live in the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website at _[http://ir.verramobility.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291845-1&h=1032499602&u=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verramobility.com&a=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verramobility.com). _\n\nAn audio replay of the call will also be available until 11:59 p.m. ET on November 14, 2024, by dialing 1-844-512-2921 for the U.S. or Canada, and 1-412-317-6671 for international callers and entering passcode 1131162.

In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this release can or will be achieved. This press release should be read in conjunction with the information included in our other press releases, reports and other filings with the SEC. Additional information regarding the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2024. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise. Understanding the information contained in these filings is important in order to fully understand our reported financial results and our business outlook for future periods.\n\n**Additional Information** We periodically provide information for investors on our corporate website, _[www.verramobility.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291845-1&h=2291819782&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verramobility.com&a=www.verramobility.com)_ , and our investor relations website, [ _ir.verramobility.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291845-1&h=3200492386&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.verramobility.com%2F&a=ir.verramobility.com). \n\nWe intend to use our website including our quarterly earnings presentation as a means of disclosing material non-public information, additional financial and operating metrics and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information in this press release. These financial measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and are not intended to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Net Debt, and Net Leverage are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. As a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled performance measures presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurements have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations.\n\nWe are not providing a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Free Cash Flow or Net Leverage which are included in our 2024 financial guidance above, in reliance on the \"unreasonable efforts\" exception for forward-looking non-GAAP measures set forth in SEC rules because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort and expense. In this regard, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income, Adjusted EPS to net income per share, Adjusted Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities and Net Leverage, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Due to the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions used in preparing forward-looking non-GAAP measures, we caution investors that actual results could differ materially from these non-GAAP financial projections.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP metrics EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA Margin to measure our performance from period to period, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. We use the non-GAAP metrics Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow in connection with managing the business and converting Net Income to cash available for capital allocation and we use the non-GAAP metrics \"Net Debt\" and \"Net Leverage\" to understand our overall leverage position and to evaluate capital allocation decisions. In addition, we also believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance, liquidity and leverage relative to other periods. These non-GAAP measures have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as substitutes for net income, cash flows from operations, earnings per share, other consolidated income, cash flow or debt data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA** We define \"EBITDA\" as net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" further excludes certain non-cash expenses and non-recurring items.\n\n**Free Cash Flow** We define \"Free Cash Flow\" as net cash flow provided by operating activities less purchases of installation and service parts and property and equipment.\n\n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow** We define \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" as Free Cash Flow which further excludes certain one-time and non-recurring items such as the PlusPass legal settlement expense.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income** We define \"Adjusted Net Income\" as net income adjusted to exclude amortization of intangibles and certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses such as change in fair value of private placement warrants, change in fair value of interest rate swap, loss on extinguishment of debt, among other items.\n\n**Adjusted EPS** We define \"Adjusted EPS\" as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted average shares for the period.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin** We define \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.\n\n**Net Debt** We define \"Net Debt\" as total long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) excluding original issue discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Net Leverage** We define \"Net Leverage\" as Net Debt divided by the trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA as of the current quarter-end. The trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of the year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA reported in the current year and the applicable quarter-to-date Adjusted EBITDA amounts reported in the prior year period (for example, the trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2024 is the sum of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended December 31, 2023).\n\n**VERRA MOBILITY CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n(Unaudited)  \n**_(In thousands, except per share data)_** |  **September 30 ,2024** |  **December 31
