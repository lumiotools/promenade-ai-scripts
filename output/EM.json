Additionally, this quarter, we have proactively begun exploring opportunities in the mobile device charging service market beyond China as a way to diversify our operation. By taking these steps, we are positioning the Company to capture the long-term value of the industry and deliver substantial returns to our investors.”\n\n“The pace at which we have rebalanced our operations between the direct model and the network partner model has exceeded our initial expectations,” said Peifeng Xu, President. “Although the shift in our business model has imposed short-term impacts on our new POI expansion rate, we remain confident in our long-term prospects. Notably, the reduction in our direct model operations will not only lower our operational expenses but also enhance the contribution from the higher-margin network partner model.”\n\n“Our return to profitability this quarter is a positive development, especially in light of the current transitions,” said Maria Yi Xin, Chief Financial Officer. “We will continue to pursue higher levels of operational efficiency within our core mobile device charging service. Simultaneously, we are committed to investing in new initiatives that will leverage Energy Monster’s existing capabilities and unlock new avenues for growth. These efforts are essential as we aim to realize our full growth potential and consistently deliver sustained value to our shareholders.”\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 202****4****Revenues** were RMB462.9 million (US$63.7 million5) for the second quarter of 2024, representing a 55.3% decrease from the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners.\n\n  * **M****obile device charging****revenues** , which consist of revenues generated under both the direct and network partner models, decreased by 60.0% to RMB410.6 million (US$56.5 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB1,026.3 million in the same period of 2023. \n    * Revenues generated under the direct model, comprising of mobile device charging service fees of RMB115.9 million and power bank sales of RMB2.2 million, decreased by 60.7% to RMB118.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB300.7 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in number of POIs operated under the direct model.\n    * Revenues generated under the network partner model, comprising of (i) mobile device charging solution fees, which increased by 14.3% year-over-year to RMB61.5 million, and (ii) power bank, cabinet and other related sales, which decreased by 65.6% year-over-year to RMB231.0 million, decreased by 59.7% to RMB292.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB725.6 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners.\n  * **O****ther revenues** , which primarily comprise of revenues from new business initiatives and advertising services, increased by 453.7% to RMB52.3 million (US$7.2 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB9.4 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to new business initiatives.\n\n\n\n**Cost of revenues** decreased by 67.2% to RMB219.6 million (US$30.2 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB668.5 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners and the decrease in depreciation as a result of the decrease in number of POIs operated under the direct model.\n\n**Research and development expenses** increased by 11.6% to RMB20.8 million (US$2.9 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB18.7 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in personnel related expenses.\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses** decreased by 38.7% to RMB180.9 million (US$24.9 million) for the second quarter of 2024 from RMB295.2 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in incentive fees paid to location partners under the direct model and personnel related expenses.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** increased by 26.8% to RMB39.5 million (US$5.4 million) for the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB31.1 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in reserve for doubtful accounts in relation to the increasing contribution of the network partner model.\n\n**Loss from operations** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB6.0 million (US$0.8 million), compared to an income from operations of RMB13.6 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Net****income** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million), compared to a net income of RMB24.5 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Non-GAAP a****djusted net income** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB15.2 million (US$2.1 million), compared to a non-GAAP adjusted net income of RMB30.1 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Net****income****attributable to ordinary shareholders** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million), compared to a net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB24.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB3.2 billion (US$440.9 million). \n\n**SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION** The table below sets forth the breakdown of mobile device charging revenue components based on the latest classification for the periods indicated:\n\n**2023Q2**| **2024Q1**| **2024Q2**  \n---|---|---  \n**thousands RMB**| **thousands RMB**| **thousands RMB**  \n**Mobile device charging:**  \n**Direct Model**| **300,701**| **155,224**| **118,105**  \nMobile device charging service| 293,922| 152,108| 115,863  \nPower bank sales| 6,779| 3,116| 2,242  \n**Network Partner Model**| **725,577**| **222,852**| **292,505**  \nMobile device charging service| -| -| -  \nMobile device charging solution| 53,793| 59,016| 61,508  \nPower bank, cabinet and other related sales| 671,784| 163,836| 230,997  \n**Total mobile device charging**| **1,026,278**| **378,076**| **410,610**  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION** The company will hold a conference call at 8:00 A.M.

The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in its business, provide further information about its results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measure does not reflect all items of expenses that affect its operations and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, the Company’s non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling its non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, which should be considered when evaluating performance. Investors and others are encouraged to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**Smart Share Global Limited**  \n---  \n**Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In thousands, except for share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)**  \n**December 31, 2023**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| 588,644| 735,208| 101,168  \nRestricted cash| 173,246| 146,037| 20,095  \nShort-term investments| 2,541,889| 2,302,795| 316,875  \nAccounts receivable, net| 269,736| 300,853| 41,399  \nInventory| 106,530| 155,743| 21,431  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 345,744| 327,539| 45,071  \n**Total current assets**| **4,025,789**| **3,968,175**| **546,039**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nLong-term restricted cash| 20,000| 20,000| 2,752  \nProperty, equipment and software, net| 322,806| 237,794| 32,722  \nRight-of-use assets, net| 16,353| 11,134| 1,532  \nOther non-current assets| 21,621| 16,592| 2,283  \nDeferred tax assets, net| 18,804| 18,804| 2,587  \n**Total non-current assets**| **399,584**| **304,324**| **41,876**  \n**Total assets**| **4,425,373**| **4,272,499**| **587,915**  \n**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts and notes payable| 764,741| 699,504| 96,254  \nSalary and welfare payable| 143,653| 122,335| 16,834  \nTaxes payable| 214,738| 213,000| 29,310  \nCurrent portion of lease liabilities| 7,399| 5,241| 721  \nAccruals and other current liabilities| 336,959| 334,455| 46,023  \n**Total current liabilities**| **1,467,490**| **1,374,535**| **189,142**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nNon-current lease liabilities| 7,641| 5,390| 742  \nAmounts due to related parties-non-current| 1,000| 1,000| 138  \nOther non-current liabilities| 195,585| 207,501| 28,553  \n**Total non-current liabilities**| **204,226**| **213,891**| **29,433**  \n**Total liabilities**| **1,671,716**| **1,588,426**| **218,575**  \n**SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nOrdinary shares| 347| 347| 48  \nTreasury stock| (5,549| )| (44,243| )| (6,088| )  \nAdditional paid-in capital| 11,791,570| 11,743,588| 1,615,971  \nStatutory reserves| 16,593| 16,593| 2,283  \nAccumulated other comprehensive income| 182,824| 191,087| 26,294  \nAccumulated deficit| (9,232,128| )| (9,223,299| )| (1,269,168| )  \n**Total shareholders' equity**| **2,753,657**| **2,684,073**| **369,340**  \n**Total liabilities and shareholders' equity**| **4,425,373**| **4,272,499**| **587,915**  \n  \n**Smart Share Global Limited**  \n---  \n**Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income**  \n**(In thousands, except for share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)**  \n**Three months ended June 30,**| **Six months ended June 30,**  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**| **RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**Revenues:**  \nMobile device charging| 1,026,278| 410,610| 56,502| 1,839,323| 788,686| 108,527  \nOthers| 9,448| 52,313| 7,199| 19,238| 71,443| 9,831  \n**Total revenues**| **1,035,726**| **462,923**| **63,701**| **1,858,561**| **860,129**| **118,358**  \nCost of revenues| (668,547| )| (219,600| )| (30,218| )| (795,936| )| (387,337| )| (53,299| )  \nResearch and development expenses| (18,651| )| (20,812| )| (2,864| )| (40,095| )| (40,486| )| (5,571| )  \nSales and marketing expenses| (295,150| )| (180,949| )| (24,899| )| (960,424| )| (385,443| )| (53,039| )  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| (31,117| )| (39,450| )| (5,429| )| (57,888| )| (66,034| )| (9,087| )  \nOther operating loss| (8,703| )| (8,133| )| (1,119| )| (6,435| )| (9,607| )| (1,322| )  \n**Income/(loss) from operations**| **13,558**| **(6,021**| **)**| **(828**| **)**| **(2,217**| **)**| **(28,778**| **)**| **(3,960**| **)**  \nInterest and investment income| 28,054| 28,754| 3,957| 54,290| 59,343| 8,166  \nInterest expense to third parties| -| -| -| (4,228| )| -| -

Additionally, this quarter, we have proactively begun exploring opportunities in the mobile device charging service market beyond China as a way to diversify our operation. By taking these steps, we are positioning the Company to capture the long-term value of the industry and deliver substantial returns to our investors.”\n\n“The pace at which we have rebalanced our operations between the direct model and the network partner model has exceeded our initial expectations,” said Peifeng Xu, President. “Although the shift in our business model has imposed short-term impacts on our new POI expansion rate, we remain confident in our long-term prospects. Notably, the reduction in our direct model operations will not only lower our operational expenses but also enhance the contribution from the higher-margin network partner model.”\n\n“Our return to profitability this quarter is a positive development, especially in light of the current transitions,” said Maria Yi Xin, Chief Financial Officer. “We will continue to pursue higher levels of operational efficiency within our core mobile device charging service. Simultaneously, we are committed to investing in new initiatives that will leverage Energy Monster’s existing capabilities and unlock new avenues for growth. These efforts are essential as we aim to realize our full growth potential and consistently deliver sustained value to our shareholders.”\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 202****4****Revenues** were RMB462.9 million (US$63.7 million5) for the second quarter of 2024, representing a 55.3% decrease from the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners.\n\n  * **M****obile device charging****revenues** , which consist of revenues generated under both the direct and network partner models, decreased by 60.0% to RMB410.6 million (US$56.5 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB1,026.3 million in the same period of 2023. \n    * Revenues generated under the direct model, comprising of mobile device charging service fees of RMB115.9 million and power bank sales of RMB2.2 million, decreased by 60.7% to RMB118.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB300.7 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in number of POIs operated under the direct model.\n    * Revenues generated under the network partner model, comprising of (i) mobile device charging solution fees, which increased by 14.3% year-over-year to RMB61.5 million, and (ii) power bank, cabinet and other related sales, which decreased by 65.6% year-over-year to RMB231.0 million, decreased by 59.7% to RMB292.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB725.6 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners.\n  * **O****ther revenues** , which primarily comprise of revenues from new business initiatives and advertising services, increased by 453.7% to RMB52.3 million (US$7.2 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB9.4 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to new business initiatives.\n\n\n\n**Cost of revenues** decreased by 67.2% to RMB219.6 million (US$30.2 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB668.5 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to certain one-time adjustments made to the mobile device charging cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the change in the contractual arrangement with network partners and the decrease in depreciation as a result of the decrease in number of POIs operated under the direct model.\n\n**Research and development expenses** increased by 11.6% to RMB20.8 million (US$2.9 million) for the second quarter of 2024, from RMB18.7 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in personnel related expenses.\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses** decreased by 38.7% to RMB180.9 million (US$24.9 million) for the second quarter of 2024 from RMB295.2 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in incentive fees paid to location partners under the direct model and personnel related expenses.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** increased by 26.8% to RMB39.5 million (US$5.4 million) for the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB31.1 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in reserve for doubtful accounts in relation to the increasing contribution of the network partner model.\n\n**Loss from operations** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB6.0 million (US$0.8 million), compared to an income from operations of RMB13.6 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Net****income** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million), compared to a net income of RMB24.5 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Non-GAAP a****djusted net income** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB15.2 million (US$2.1 million), compared to a non-GAAP adjusted net income of RMB30.1 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Net****income****attributable to ordinary shareholders** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million), compared to a net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB24.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB3.2 billion (US$440.9 million). \n\n**SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION** The table below sets forth the breakdown of mobile device charging revenue components based on the latest classification for the periods indicated:\n\n**2023Q2**| **2024Q1**| **2024Q2**  \n---|---|---  \n**thousands RMB**| **thousands RMB**| **thousands RMB**  \n**Mobile device charging:**  \n**Direct Model**| **300,701**| **155,224**| **118,105**  \nMobile device charging service| 293,922| 152,108| 115,863  \nPower bank sales| 6,779| 3,116| 2,242  \n**Network Partner Model**| **725,577**| **222,852**| **292,505**  \nMobile device charging service| -| -| -  \nMobile device charging solution| 53,793| 59,016| 61,508  \nPower bank, cabinet and other related sales| 671,784| 163,836| 230,997  \n**Total mobile device charging**| **1,026,278**| **378,076**| **410,610**  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION** The company will hold a conference call at 8:00 A.M.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to,” or other similar expressions. Among other things, the business outlook and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as the Company’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. The Company may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in its annual reports to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Energy Monster’s strategies; its future business development, financial condition and results of operations; the impact of technological advancements on the pricing of and demand for its services; competition in the mobile device charging service industry; Chinese governmental policies and regulations affecting the mobile device charging service industry; changes in its revenues, costs or expenditures; general economic and business conditions globally and in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in the Company’s filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release, and the Company does not undertake any duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE** In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP adjusted net income in reviewing and assessing its operating performance. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in its business, provide further information about its results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measure does not reflect all items of expenses that affect its operations and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, the Company’s non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling its non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, which should be considered when evaluating performance. Investors and others are encouraged to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**Smart Share Global Limited**  \n---  \n**Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In thousands, except for share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)**  \n**December 31, 2023**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| 588,644| 735,208| 101,168  \nRestricted cash| 173,246| 146,037| 20,095  \nShort-term investments| 2,541,889| 2,302,795| 316,875  \nAccounts receivable, net| 269,736| 300,853| 41,399  \nInventory| 106,530| 155,743| 21,431  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 345,744| 327,539| 45,071  \n**Total current assets**| **4,025,789**| **3,968,175**| **546,039**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nLong-term restricted cash| 20,000| 20,000| 2,752  \nProperty, equipment and software, net| 322,806| 237,794| 32,722  \nRight-of-use assets, net| 16,353| 11,134| 1,532  \nOther non-current assets| 21,621| 16,592| 2,283  \nDeferred tax assets, net| 18,804| 18,804| 2,587  \n**Total non-current assets**| **399,584**| **304,324**| **41,876**  \n**Total assets**| **4,425,373**| **4,272,499**| **587,915**  \n**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts and notes payable| 764,741| 699,504| 96,254  \nSalary and welfare payable| 143,653| 122,335| 16,834  \nTaxes payable| 214,738| 213,000| 29,310  \nCurrent portion of lease liabilities| 7,399| 5,241| 721  \nAccruals and other current liabilities| 336,959| 334,455| 46,023  \n**Total current liabilities**| **1,467,490**| **1,374,535**| **189,142**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nNon-current lease liabilities| 7,641| 5,390| 742  \nAmounts due to related parties-non-current| 1,000| 1,000| 138  \nOther non-current liabilities| 195,585| 207,501| 28,553  \n**Total non-current liabilities**| **204,226**| **213,891**| **29,433**  \n**Total liabilities**| **1,671,716**| **1,588,426**| **218,575**  \n**SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nOrdinary shares| 347| 347| 48  \nTreasury stock| (5,549| )| (44,243| )| (6,088| )  \nAdditional paid-in capital| 11,791,570| 11,743,588| 1,615,971  \nStatutory reserves| 16,593| 16,593| 2,283  \nAccumulated other comprehensive income| 182,824| 191,087| 26,294  \nAccumulated deficit| (9,232,128| )| (9,223,299| )| (1,269,168| )  \n**Total shareholders' equity**| **2,753,657**| **2,684,073**| **369,340**  \n**Total liabilities and shareholders' equity**| **4,425,373**| **4,272,499**| **587,915**  \n  \n**Smart Share Global Limited**  \n---  \n**Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income**  \n**(In thousands, except for share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)**  \n**Three months ended June 30,**| **Six months ended June 30,**  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**| **RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**Revenues:**  \nMobile device charging| 1,026,278| 410,610| 56,502| 1,839,323| 788,686| 108,527  \nOthers| 9,448| 52,313| 7,199| 19,238| 71,443| 9,831  \n**Total revenues**| **1,035,726**| **462,923**| **63,701**| **1,858,561**| **860,129**| **118,358**  \nCost of revenues| (668,547| )| (219,600| )| (30,218| )| (795,936| )| (387,337| )| (53,299| )  \nResearch and development expenses| (18,651| )| (20,812| )| (2,864| )| (40,095| )| (40,486| )| (5,571| )  \nSales and marketing expenses| (295,150| )| (180,949| )| (24,899| )| (960,424| )| (385,443| )| (53,039| )  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| (31,117| )| (39,450| )| (5,429| )| (57,888| )| (66,034| )| (9,087| )  \nOther operating loss| (8,703| )| (8,133| )| (1,119| )| (6,435| )| (9,607| )| (1,322| )  \n**Income/(loss) from operations**| **13,558**| **(6,021**| **)**| **(828**| **)**| **(2,217**| **)**| **(28,778**| **)**| **(3,960**| **)**  \nInterest and investment income| 28,054| 28,754| 3,957| 54,290| 59,343| 8,166  \nInterest expense to third parties| -| -| -| (4,228| )| -| -

The Nasdaq notification letter has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s ADSs on Nasdaq.\n\nPursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company is provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until February 3, 2025, to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If at any time during the 180-day compliance period, the closing bid price of the Company’s ADSs is US$1.00 per share or higher for at least ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by February 3, 2025, subject to the determination by the staff of Nasdaq, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement. In this case, the Company will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\n\nThe Nasdaq notification letter does not affect the Company’s business operations, and the Company will take all reasonable measures to regain compliance within the prescribed grace period.\n\n**About Smart Share Global Limited**\n\nSmart Share Global Limited (Nasdaq: EM), or Energy Monster, is a consumer tech company with the mission to energize everyday life.
