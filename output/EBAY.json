For figures in this press release reported on an\n\"FX-Neutral basis,” the company calculates the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates,\nexcluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its\nprospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and\ninvestors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be\nindicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results\nto investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include\nstock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible\nassets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign\nexchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including\nchanges in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains\nor losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes\nassociated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP\nmeasures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and\nmargin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted\nstock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily\nbecause they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer\npayroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock\noption exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the\ncompany's operation of the business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related\nforeign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain\ngains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection\nwith acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these\namounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the\nnon-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not\nbelieve they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.\nRestructuring. These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes\nsignificant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nOther certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are significant\ngains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the\npast and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily\nbecause management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results. These amounts include changes in\nfair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.\nChange in fair market value of warrant. These are gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with\nAdyen, which are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.\nIncome tax effects and adjustments. We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term\nprojections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant\nchanges in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows\nless purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to\nmanagement and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment,\nwhich can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay\ndividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or\ndecrease in the company's cash balance for the period and does not exclude certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt\nservice requirements.\n11\neBay Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income*\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nGAAP operating income $ 595 $ 455 $ 1,775 $ 1,531\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer\npayroll taxes 149 146 457 436\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of net\nrevenues and operating expenses 10 8 27 26\nRestructuring (4) — (10) 42\nNon-recurring legal matters (50) 50 (56) 50\nOther general and administrative expenses — (1) 1 1\nTotal non-GAAP operating income adjustments 105 203 419 555\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 700 $ 658 $ 2,194 $ 2,086\nGAAP operating margin 23.1 % 18.2 % 23.0 % 20.3 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 27.2 % 26.4 % 28.5 % 27.7 %\n*Presented on a continuing operations basis\n12\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income and\nGAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except per share amounts and percentages)\nGAAP income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 797 $ 1,661 $ 1,661 $ 2,676\nGAAP provision for income taxes (161) (355) (360) (629)\nGAAP net income from continuing operations $ 636 $ 1,306 $ 1,301 $ 2,047\nNon-GAAP adjustments to net income from continuing\noperations:\nNon-GAAP operating income from continuing operations\nadjustments (see table above) $ 105 $ 203 $ 419 $ 555\nChange in fair value of equity investment in Adevinta — (1,367) 234 (1,331)\nRealized change in fair value of shares sold in Adevinta — — (78) —\nFair value of Aurelia option (35) — 74 —\nChange in fair market value of warrant (145) 109 (120) 40\nChange in fair market value of other equity investments (18) 46 11 95\nIncome tax effects and adjustments 45 248 (3) 294\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations $ 588 $ 545 $ 1,838 $ 1,700\nDiluted net income from continuing operations per share:\nGAAP $ 1.29 $ 2.46 $ 2.57 $ 3.81\nNon-GAAP $ 1.19 $ 1.03 $ 3.63 $ 3.17\nShares used in GAAP diluted net income per share calculation 494 532 507 537\nShares used in non-GAAP diluted net income per share\ncalculation 494 532 507 537\nGAAP effective tax rate – Continuing operations 20.2 % 21.4 % 21.7 % 23.5 %\nIncome tax effects and adjustments to net income from\ncontinuing operations (3.7) % (4.9) % (5.2) % (7.0) %\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate – Continuing operations 16.5 % 16.5 % 16.5 % 16.5 %\n13\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 755 $ 862 $ 1,737 $ 2,308\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment (109) (85) (341) (330)\nFree cash flow $ 646 $ 777 $ 1,396 $ 1,978\n14"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company\neBay Inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. Our technology\nempowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. Our\nMarketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform businesses in\nJapan and the United States, and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for\ndiscovering great value and unique selection.\nWhen we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” or “eBay” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we mean the current Delaware\ncorporation (eBay Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to provisions for transaction losses,\nlegal contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, investments including level 3 investments in Gmarket Global\nLLC (“Gmarket”), warrants and the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives\nfor our servers and networking equipment from three years to four years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our\nhardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, based on\nservers and network equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation expense of $14 million and an increase to net income of $11 million, or\n$0.02 per basic share and $0.02 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based\non servers and network equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation expense of $57 million and an increase to net income of $45 million, or\n$0.09 per basic share and $0.09 per diluted share.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc. and our wholly and majority-\nowned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a\nnoncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidation requirement for variable interest entities. Generally,\ninvestments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over\nthe investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, including those in which the fair value option has been elected.\nFor equity method investments, our share of the investees’ results of operations is included in “Interest income and other, net” and\ninvestment balances are included in “Long-term investments”. For equity method investments under the fair value option, the change in fair value\nof the investment is included in “Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net” and investment balances are included in “Long-term\ninvestments”, other than our equity interest in Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”), which was included in the “Current assets” section on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 as discussed in “Note 5 — Investments.”\n11\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nInvestments in entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest are generally accounted for as equity investments to be measured at\nfair value, under an election, or at cost if it does not have readily determinable fair value, in which case the carrying value would be adjusted\nupon the occurrence of an observable price change in an orderly transaction for identical or similar instruments or impairment.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023\nForm 10-K”). We have evaluated all subsequent events through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. In the\nopinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring\nadjustments, which are necessary for the fair statement of the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for\nthese interim periods.\nEffective January 1, 2024, certain immaterial prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in\nthe condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Specifically, immaterial restricted cash balances previously\nreported as components of “Short-term investments” and “Long-term investments” are now reported within the “Other current assets” and “Other\nassets” sections, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in “Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” in our 2023 Form 10-K, except customer accounts and funds receivable and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nresulting from a change in our approach to safeguarding customer funds beginning in the first quarter of 2024, as noted below.\nCustomer accounts and funds receivable\nCustomer accounts represent cash received from buyers that is held by financial institutions. Due to safeguarding requirements in certain\nregions, a portion of this balance is considered restricted. Funds receivable represents customer cash in transit and held by payment\nprocessors. These balances are associated with marketplace activity and are awaiting payment to sellers.\nWe are exposed to credit losses from customer accounts and funds receivable balances held by third party financial institutions and\npayment processors. We assess these balances for credit loss based on a review of the average period for which the funds are held, current\ncredit ratings and our assessment of the probability of default and loss given default models. In the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, no credit-\nrelated losses were recorded.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased,\nwhich may include bank deposits, U.S. Treasury securities, time deposits, and certificates of deposit.\nWe consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Restricted cash is held in interest bearing accounts\nfor letters of credit related to our global sabbatical program and for certain amounts related to other compensation arrangements held in escrow.\nWe also hold restricted cash in segregated bank accounts for purposes of safeguarding customer funds.\n12\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07—Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures. The new guidance is intended to improve reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses enabling investors to better understand an\nentity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements,\nclarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements\nfor entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The standard will be effective for annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not expect the\nadoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for\nand Disclosure of Crypto Assets. The new guidance addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain crypto assets and\nrequires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting\nperiod. In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of certain crypto assets. The standard is effective for\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the\nadoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new\nguidance is intended to further standardize income tax disclosures primarily related to the presentation of the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid information in our financial statements and disclosures. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n13\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 2 — Net Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number\nof shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and\nequity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.

As interest\nrates increase, securities purchased at a lower yield show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The unrealized losses are primarily due to changes\nin credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative and\nquantitative criteria. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other\ncomprehensive income. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is\nrecognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. From time to time, we sell available-for-sale\ndebt securities in an unrealized loss position and recognize an immaterial loss.\n17\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nWe regularly review investment securities for credit impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In making this assessment,\nwe consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash\nflows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows\nexpected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through\ninterest income and other, net for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment\nthat has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of approximately 135 million of our voting\nshares in Adevinta to Permira, inclusive of the option exercised by Permira to purchase additional voting shares, for total cash consideration of\napproximately $2.3 billion, which reduced our ownership in Adevinta to 33%.\nAt the initial recognition of this equity investment in Adevinta, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are\nrecognized in “Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net” in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The investment was\nreported within the “Current assets” section in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and was classified within Level 1 in the fair value\nhierarchy.

Our equity investment in Gmarket was valued at\n$728 million as of the transaction close date.\nAt the initial recognition of this equity investment, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are recognized\nin “Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net” in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The investment is reported within\n“Long-term investments” in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation\nreflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. We believe the fair value\noption election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Gmarket.

The fair value of the investment was $323 million and $335 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOther investments\nCertain other individually immaterial equity investments aggregating to $55 million as of September 30, 2024 and $47 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient, and have not been\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to “Note 7 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for more information.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately-held\ncompanies for which we do not exercise significant influence and are accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement\nalternative, the carrying value is measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in value and impairments of equity investments without\nreadily determinable fair values are recognized in “Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net” in our condensed consolidated statement\nof income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are presented within “Long-term investments” in our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nEquity investment in Aurelia\nAs discussed in the “Equity Investment in Adevinta” section above, our equity investment in Aurelia is accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative as we are not able to exercise significant influence over Aurelia. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, no upward or downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity investment in Aurelia were recorded. The carrying value of the\ninvestment was $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nIn connection with the Transactions discussed above, we also granted Aurelia UK Feederco Limited a six month option to purchase Aurelia\nshares (the \"Aurelia Option\"), which, if exercised, would reduce our ownership in Aurelia to approximately 8.3% of the outstanding equity of\nAurelia. The Aurelia Option is reported within the “Current liabilities” section in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is classified within\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe equity investment.

We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nWe use foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets and\nliabilities, including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration\nbut with maturities up to 24 months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash\nflows are not adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. We evaluate the effectiveness of our\nforeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted hedged\ntransaction affects earnings. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains\nand losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings. As of September 30, 2024, we have\nestimated that approximately $38 million of net derivative losses related to our foreign exchange cash flow hedges and $8 million of net\nderivative gains related to our interest rate cash flow hedges included in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We\nclassify cash flows related to our cash flow hedges as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNon-Designated Hedges\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge\nmonetary assets or liabilities, including intercompany balances and equity investments denominated in non-functional currencies. The gains and\nlosses on our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in “Interest income and other, net”, which are offset by the foreign\ncurrency gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities that are also recorded in “Interest income and other, net”. We classify cash flows\nrelated to our non-designated hedging instruments in the same line item as the cash flows of the related assets or liabilities, which is generally\nwithin operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash flows related to the settlement of non-designated\nhedging instruments related to equity investments are classified within investing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash\nflows.\nWarrant\nWe entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen N.V. (“Adyen”) that, subject to meeting\ncertain conditions, entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a\nspecific date. The warrant has a term of seven years and vests in a series of four tranches, at a specified price per share (fixed for the first two\ntranches) upon meeting processing volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When or if a relevant milestone is reached, the warrant\nbecomes exercisable with respect to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The\nmaximum number of tranches that can vest in one calendar year is two.\nThe warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We report the warrant at fair value within\n“Other current assets” in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in “Gain (loss)\non equity investments and warrant, net” in our condensed consolidated statement of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of\nthe warrant, which was recorded as a deferred credit, is reported within “Other liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is\namortized over the life of the commercial arrangement. See “Note 7 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for information about\nthe fair value measurement of the warrant.\n22\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOn October 15, 2024, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the second tranche of the Adyen warrant. Upon vesting of\nthe second tranche, we exercised the option to purchase approximately 404 thousand shares of Adyen valued at $630 million on the settlement\ndate of October 30, 2024 in exchange for $108 million in cash.\nFair Value of Derivative Contracts\nThe following table presents fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nBalance Sheet Location 2024 2023\nDerivative Assets:\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Other current assets $ 7 $ 10\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments Other current assets 9 13\nWarrant Other current assets 484 364\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Other assets 6 9\nTotal derivative assets $ 506 $ 396\nDerivative Liabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Other current liabilities $ 7 $ 14\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments Other current liabilities 13 19\nTotal derivative liabilities $ 20 $ 33\nTotal fair value of derivative instruments $ 486 $ 363\nUnder the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our derivative contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we\nare allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to\npresent the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe potential effect of rights of set-off associated with the foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities by $14\nmillion, resulting in net derivative assets of $8 million and net derivative liabilities of $6 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was no potential\neffect of rights of set-off associated with the interest rate contracts as there were no asset positions.\nEffect of Derivative Contracts on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables present the activity of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges gross of tax as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, and the impact of these derivative contracts on AOCI as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nLess: Amount of Gain (Loss)\nAmount of Loss Recognized in Reclassified From AOCI to\nDecember 31, 2023 Other Comprehensive Income Earnings September 30, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash\nflow hedges $ (64) $ (26) $ (32) $ (58)\nInterest rate contracts designated as cash flow\nhedges 51 — 6 45\nTotal $ (13) $ (26) $ (26) $ (13)\n23\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nLess: Amount of Gain\nAmount of Gain Recognized in Reclassified From AOCI to\nDecember 31, 2022 Other Comprehensive Income Earnings September 30, 2023\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash\nflow hedges $ 52 $ 2 $ 43 $ 11\nInterest rate contracts designated as cash flow\nhedges 62 — 9 53\nTotal $ 114 $ 2 $ 52 $ 64\nEffect of Derivative Contracts on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income\nThe following table summarizes the total gain (loss) recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of income from our foreign\nexchange derivative contracts by location for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges recognized in net\nrevenues $ (11) $ 2 $ (31) $ 45\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges recognized in cost\nof net revenues (1) (1) (1) (2)\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments recognized\nin interest income and other, net (16) (2) 4 4\nTotal gain (loss) recognized from foreign exchange derivative contracts in the\ncondensed consolidated statement of income $ (28) $ (1) $ (28) $ 47\nThe following table summarizes the total gain recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of income from our interest rate\nderivative contracts by location for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGain from interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges recognized in\ninterest expense $ 2 $ 2 $ 6 $ 9\nGain from interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges recognized in\ninterest expense — — 2 —\nTotal gain recognized from interest rate derivative contracts in the\ncondensed consolidated statement of income $ 2 $ 2 $ 8 $ 9\nThe following table summarizes the total gain (loss) recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of income due to changes in the\nfair value of the warrant for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGain (loss) attributable to changes in the fair value of warrant recognized in\ngain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net $ 145 $ (109) $ 120 $ (40)\n24\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNotional Amounts of Derivative Contracts\nDerivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded in our condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally\nnot exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which the value of foreign exchange payments under these contracts are determined. The\nfollowing table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivatives as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nForeign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges $ 1,395 $ 1,699\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments 1,509 2,225\nTotal $ 2,904 $ 3,924\nCredit Risk\nOur derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek\nto mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk\nof loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. To further limit credit risk, we also enter\ninto collateral security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if\nthe fair value of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit\ndowngrade by either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative\ntransactions.\n25\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 7 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated (in\nmillions):\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nSeptember 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,589 $ 1,589 $ — $ —\nCustomer accounts 679 679 — —\nRestricted cash included in other\ncurrent assets 102 102 — —\nRestricted cash included in other\nassets 2 2 — —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash 2,372 2,372 — —\nDerivatives 506 — 22 484\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate debt securities 2,585 — 2,585 —\nGovernment and agency securities 717 — 717 —\nTotal short-term investments 3,302 — 3,302 —\nLong-term investments:\nCorporate debt securities 664 — 664 —\nGovernment and agency securities 292 — 292 —\nEquity investment under the fair value\noption 323 — — 323\nTotal long-term investments 1,279 — 956 323\nTotal financial assets $ 7,459 $ 2,372 $ 4,280 $ 807\nLiabilities:\nAurelia option $ 74 $ — $ — $ 74\nDerivatives $ 20 $ — $ 20 $ —\n26\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nDecember 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,985 $ 1,985 $ — $ —\nCustomer accounts 481 481 — —\nRestricted cash included in other\ncurrent assets 23 23 — —\nRestricted cash included in other\nassets 4 4 — —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash 2,493 2,493 — —\nEquity investment in Adevinta 4,474 4,474 — —\nDerivatives 396 — 32 364\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate debt securities 2,162 — 2,162 —\nGovernment and agency securities 371 — 371 —\nTotal short-term investments 2,533 — 2,533 —\nLong-term investments:\nCorporate debt securities 328 — 328 —\nGovernment and agency securities 271 — 271 —\nEquity investment under the fair value\noption 335 — — 335\nTotal long-term investments 934 — 599 335\nTotal financial assets $ 10,830 $ 6,967 $ 3,164 $ 699\nLiabilities:\nOther liabilities $ 10 $ — $ — $ 10\nDerivatives $ 33 $ — $ 33 $ —\nOur financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1), less active markets (Level 2) and little\nor no market activity (Level 3).

Our warrant, which is accounted for\nas a derivative instrument, is valued using a Black-Scholes model. Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates,\nAdyen’s common stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding, exercise price, and details specific to the warrant. The value is\nalso probability adjusted for management’s assumptions with respect to vesting of the remaining three tranches which are each subject to\nmeeting processing volume milestone targets.

Accounts receivable represents amounts invoiced and\nrevenue recognized prior to invoicing when we have satisfied our performance obligation and have the unconditional right to payment. The\nallowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other factors\nthat may affect our customers’ ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits was $34 million and $49 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we reported an allowance for doubtful accounts of $10\nmillion, reflecting a decrease of $13 million, net of write-offs of $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30,\n2024, we reported an allowance for authorized credits of $24 million, reflecting a decrease of $2 million, net of write-offs of $3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we reported an allowance for doubtful accounts of $23 million and an allowance\nfor authorized credits of $26 million.\nDeferred revenue consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally\nshort-term duration of contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied in the following reporting period.

If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable\nand can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be\ndetermined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that\nrange is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome\nis reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded\nthat an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid\nin judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a\nproceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary\ndamages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to\nchange our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nOn September 27, 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (collectively, the\n“Government”), filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “District Court”) alleging that we are liable\nfor the sale of regulated or illicit products manufactured and sold by third parties who listed such products on the Marketplace platforms in a\nmanner that evaded and/or was designed to evade detection by us and in violation of the Clean Air Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and\nRodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. On September 30, 2024, the District Court issued an order dismissing the Government’s\nclaims in their entirety. We are unable to predict whether the Government will appeal the District Court’s decision. If the Government were to\nsuccessfully appeal the decision and we were subsequently found to be liable for such activities on the Marketplace, we likely would be subject\nto monetary damages, changes in our business practices, or other remedies that could have a material adverse impact on our business. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we released amounts previously accrued for estimated losses in connection with the\nGovernment’s claims, for which we previously believed a loss was probable.\nAmounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. We have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the\nproceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material.\nHowever, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved\nagainst us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition\nfor that reporting period could be material.\nIndemnification Provisions\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and\nrelationship of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between\nus and PayPal, which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to\nprotect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These\nagreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may\nbecome subject as a result of their affiliation with us.\n34\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which\nwe have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under\nthese contracts, we may indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the\nindemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to intellectual property infringement, including to our trademarks, logos\nand proprietary software, and other branding elements, such as domain names, to the extent that such are applicable to our performance under\nthe subject agreement. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud and breach of\nrepresentations, warranties and applicable law. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions\ndue to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date,\nlosses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either\nindividually or collectively.\n35\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 11 — Stockholders’ Equity\nStock Repurchase Program\nOur stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,\nsubject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our\noutstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block\ntrades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as\nmanagement deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may\nbe limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use\nof our cash.\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) authorized an incremental $2.0 billion under our stock repurchase program in\naddition to the $4.0 billion previously authorized in 2022. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.\nThe following table summarizes stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the period indicated (in millions, except\nper share amounts):\nShares Average Price Value of Shares Remaining Amount\nRepurchased (1) per Share (2) Repurchased (2) Authorized\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 $ 1,447\nAuthorization of additional repurchases in February 2024 2,000\nRepurchase of shares of common stock 42 $ 53.51 $ 2,249 (2,249)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,198\n(1) These repurchased shares of common stock were recorded as treasury stock and were accounted for under the cost method. None of the repurchased shares of common stock\nhave been retired.\n(2) Excludes broker commissions and excise tax accruals.\nDividends\nThe Company paid a total of $131 million and $132 million in cash dividends during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $405 million and $399 million in cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. In October 2024, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on December 13, 2024 to\nstockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.\n36\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 12 — Employee Benefit Plans\nRestricted Stock Unit Activity\nThe following table presents restricted stock unit (“RSU”) activity under our equity incentive plans for the period indicated (in millions):\nUnits\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2024 24\nAwarded 11\nVested (8)\nForfeited (3)\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 24\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for RSUs awarded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $52.06 per share.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the impact on our results of continuing operations of recording stock-based compensation expense for the\nperiods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of net revenues $ 13 $ 13 $ 40 $ 40\nSales and marketing 22 23 70 68\nProduct development 70 69 211 202\nGeneral and administrative 41 39 125 116\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 146 $ 144 $ 446 $ 426\nCapitalized in product development $ 5 $ 4 $ 15 $ 12\n37\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\nWe are subject to both direct and indirect taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by\ncertain tax authorities for the 2010 to 2022 tax years. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may\nultimately result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for\ntax years after 2009 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and California), Germany, India, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nThe timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and\nthe number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized\ntax benefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $170 million.\nWe have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely\nreinvest the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2024, $292 million of our liability\nfor deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in “Income taxes payable” on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, $292 million of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in “Other liabilities” on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet. We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries\nthat are unrelated to unremitted earnings. These basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred\ntaxes related to these other components of our outside basis difference is not practicable.\n38\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables summarize the changes in AOCI for the periods indicated (in millions):\nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses) on Unrealized Gains\nDerivative (Losses) Foreign Currency Estimated Tax\nInstruments on Investments Translation (Expense) Benefit Total\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 $ 16 $ (31) $ 153 $ 27 $ 165\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications (39) 31 66 2 60\nLess: Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI (10) — — 3 (7)\nNet current period other comprehensive income\n(loss) (29) 31 66 (1) 67\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ (13) $ — $ 219 $ 26 $ 232\nUnrealized Gains Unrealized Gains\non Derivative (Losses) Foreign Currency Estimated Tax\nInstruments on Investments Translation (Expense) Benefit Total\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 $ 24 $ (79) $ 186 $ 36 $ 167\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications 43 13 (30) (13) 13\nLess: Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI 3 — — (2) 1\nNet current period other comprehensive income\n(loss) 40 13 (30) (11) 12\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 $ 64 $ (66) $ 156 $ 25 $ 179\nUnrealized\n(Losses) on Unrealized Gains\nDerivative (Losses) Foreign Currency Estimated Tax\nInstruments on Investments Translation (Expense) Benefit Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ (13) $ (45) $ 206 $ 37 $ 185\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications (26) 45 13 (4) 28\nLess: Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI (26) — — 7 (19)\nNet current period other comprehensive income\n(loss) — 45 13 (11) 47\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ (13) $ — $ 219 $ 26 $ 232\nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses) on Unrealized Gains\nDerivative (Losses) Foreign Currency Estimated Tax\nInstruments on Investments Translation (Expense) Benefit Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 114 $ (98) $ 222 $ 21 $ 259\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications 2 32 (66) (9) (41)\nLess: Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI 52 — — (13) 39\nNet current period other comprehensive income\n(loss) (50) 32 (66) 4 (80)\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 $ 64 $ (66) $ 156 $ 25 $ 179\n39\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the reclassifications out of AOCI for the periods indicated (in millions):\nAffected Line Item in the Statement of\nDetails about AOCI Components Income Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From AOCI\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGains (losses) on cash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts Net revenues $ (11) $ 2 $ (31) $ 45\nForeign exchange contracts Cost of net revenues (1) (1) (1) (2)\nInterest rate contracts Interest income and other, net 2 2 6 9\nIncome from continuing operations before\nincome taxes (10) 3 (26) 52\nIncome tax provision 3 (2) 7 (13)\nTotal reclassifications for the period Net income $ (7) $ 1 $ (19) $ 39\n40\nTable of Contents\neBay Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNote 15 — Restructuring\nThe following table summarizes restructuring reserve activity for the period indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nAccrued liability, beginning of period $ 27 $ 102\nPayments (14) (83)\nAdjustments (1) (7)\nAccrued liability, end of period $ 12 $ 12\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management approved plans to drive operational improvement that included the reduction of workforce.\nThe reduction was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2023 and resulted in a pre-tax charge of $42 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, management approved plans to drive operational improvement that included the reduction of workforce\nthat resulted in a pre-tax charge of $99 million.

This section of this Form 10-Q generally discusses\nitems relating to the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and comparisons between the respective periods.\nOVERVIEW\nUnless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” “eBay” or the “Company” in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we mean eBay Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBusiness\neBay Inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. Our technology\nempowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. Our\nMarketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform businesses in\nJapan and the United States, and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for\ndiscovering great value and unique selection.\nIn 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024, we experienced dynamic discretionary spending trends resulting from geopolitical events,\ninflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence. These trends are uncertain in\nduration and are expected to continue. In addition, our operating and financial results may continue to fluctuate as a result of changes in the\nlegal and regulatory landscape and our response to those developments.\nFX-Neutral Presentation\nWe present foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”) net revenues to supplement our results of operations presented in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and to enhance investors’ understanding of our global business performance by\nexcluding the positive or negative year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on reported net revenues. We define FX-Neutral net\nrevenues as GAAP net revenues minus the exchange rate effect, which we calculate by applying prior period foreign currency exchange rates to\ncurrent year transactional currency amounts, excluding hedging activity. We believe presenting FX-Neutral net revenues provides useful\ninformation to both management and investors by isolating the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may not be indicative\nof our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain FX-Neutral results to investors, we believe that the\ninclusion of these FX-Neutral measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. FX-Neutral net revenues are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures that are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be calculated differently than other “FX-\nNeutral,” “constant currency” or similarly titled measures used by other companies. FX-Neutral net revenues are not presented as an alternative\nto GAAP net revenues and should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with GAAP net revenues.\n42\nTable of Contents\nQuarter Highlights\nNet revenues increased 3% to $2,576 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nFX-Neutral net revenues (as defined above) increased 3% during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. Operating margin increased to 23.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.2% for the same period in 2023.\nWe recorded $199 million of aggregate gains in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated\nstatement of income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1,212 million of aggregate gains recorded during the\nsame period in 2023.\nWe generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $755 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto $862 million in the same period in 2023.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made cash payments of $755 million related to the purchase of common stock\nand $131 million in dividends.\nIn October 2024, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share of common stock to be paid\non December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.\nIn August 2024, we repaid the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450% senior notes on the date of\nmaturity. As of September 30, 2024, we had $450 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.09%\nper annum, and a weighted average remaining term of 114 days.\nOn October 15, 2024, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the second tranche of the Adyen warrant. Upon vesting of\nthe second tranche, we exercised the option to purchase approximately 404 thousand shares of Adyen valued at $630 million on the settlement\ndate of October 30, 2024 in exchange for $108 million in cash.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe have one reportable segment to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker review and assess performance\nof the business. Our reportable segment is Marketplace, which includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized\ncounterparts, our off-platform businesses in Japan and the United States, and our suite of mobile apps. The accounting policies of our segment\nare the same as those described in “Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report.\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, fees to promote listings, payment services fees, listing fees, and store\nsubscription fees from sellers on our platforms. Our net revenues also include revenues from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing\narrangements and shipping fees. Our net revenues are reduced by incentives, including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our\ncustomers.\nThe following table presents net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nNet revenues $ 2,576 $ 2,500 3 % $ 7,704 $ 7,550 2 %\nSeasonality\nWe expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to trend with general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends will\ncontinue. Seasonal trends in net revenues may be influenced by macroeconomic conditions as well as the introduction and scaling of new\nproducts. The following table presents our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues for the periods\nindicated (in millions, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31 June 30 September 30 December 31\n2022\nNet revenues $ 2,483 $ 2,422 $ 2,380 $ 2,510\n% change from prior quarter (5)% (2)% (2)% 5 %\n2023\nNet revenues $ 2,510 $ 2,540 $ 2,500 $ 2,562\n% change from prior quarter — % 1 % (2)% 2 %\n2024\nNet revenues $ 2,556 $ 2,572 $ 2,576 $ —\n% change from prior quarter — % 1 % — %\n44\nTable of Contents\nNet Revenues by Geography\nRevenues are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the customer is located. The\nfollowing table presents net revenues by geography for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nU.S. $ 1,302 $ 1,259 3 % $ 3,897 $ 3,785 3 %\nPercentage of net revenues 51 % 50 % 51 % 50 %\nInternational 1,274 1,241 3 % 3,807 3,765 1 %\nPercentage of net revenues 49 % 50 % 49 % 50 %\nTotal net revenues (1)(2) $ 2,576 $ 2,500 3 % $ 7,704 $ 7,550 2 %\n(1) Net revenues included $11 million and $31 million of hedging losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $2 million and $45\nmillion of hedging gains during the same periods in 2023.\n(2) Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had unfavorable impacts of $6 million and $3 million on net revenues during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a favorable impact of $43 million and an unfavorable impact of $11 million during the same periods in 2023. The effect of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate movements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily attributable to the\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and other major currencies.\nOur commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British\npound and euro. Year-over-year appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have a material impact to our financial results. We\nexperienced elevated foreign currency volatility which we expect to continue throughout 2024. Through our hedging programs, we actively\nmonitor foreign currency volatility and attempt to mitigate significant risk. As shown in the table above, we generate approximately half of our net\nrevenues internationally. Therefore, we are subject to the risks related to conducting business in foreign countries as discussed in “Part I — Item\n1A: Risk Factors” of the 2023 Form 10-K.\nKey Operating Metrics\nGross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net revenues.\nGMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive\nof shipping fees and taxes. Despite GMV’s divergence from revenue, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of\nthe overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period.\nFX-Neutral GMV is defined as GMV minus the exchange rate effect, which we calculate by applying prior period foreign\ncurrency exchange rates to current year transactional currency amounts.\nTake rate is defined as net revenues divided by GMV and represents net revenues as a percentage of overall volume on our\nplatforms. We believe that take rate provides a useful measure of our ability to monetize volume through marketplace services\non our platforms in a given period. We use take rate to identify key revenue drivers on our marketplace.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents net revenues and our key operating metrics of GMV and take rate for the periods indicated. The following\ntable also presents a reconciliation of FX-Neutral net revenues and FX-Neutral GMV (each as defined above) to our reported net revenues and\nGMV for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nExchange Rate\nAs Reported (1) Effect FX-Neutral As Reported As Reported FX-Neutral\nNet Revenues $ 2,576 $ (6) $ 2,582 $ 2,500 3 % 3 %\nGMV $ 18,306 $ 45 $ 18,261 $ 17,991 2 % 1 %\nTake rate 14.08 % 13.90 % 0.18 %\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nExchange Rate\nAs Reported (1) Effect FX-Neutral As Reported As Reported FX-Neutral\nNet Revenues $ 7,704 $ (3) $ 7,707 $ 7,550 2 % 3 %\nGMV $ 55,347 $ 187 $ 55,160 $ 54,615 1 % 1 %\nTake rate 13.92 % 13.82 % 0.10 %\n(1) Net revenues included $11 million and $31 million of hedging losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $2 million and $45\nmillion of hedging gains during the same periods in 2023.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher GMV and the\nexpansion of promoted listings products, eBay International Shipping and financial services offered to buyers and sellers within our payments\nplatform. Net revenues and GMV increased despite the impact of dynamic discretionary spending trends resulting from geopolitical events,\ninflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence.\nCost of Net Revenues\nCost of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. Significant components\nof these costs primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation\nof equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs, shipping\ncosts and digital services tax. The following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nCost of net revenues (1)(2) $ 727 $ 705 3 % $ 2,162 $ 2,123 2 %\nPercentage of net revenues 28 % 28 % 28 % 28 %\n(1) Cost of net revenues were net of immaterial hedging activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had unfavorable impacts of $1 million and $3 million on cost of net revenues during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an unfavorable impact of $8 million and a favorable impact of $7 million during the same periods in 2023.\nThe increase in cost of net revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was\nprimarily due to a $21 million increase related to indirect tax matters, a $15 million increase in cost of promoted listings products and an\n$8 million increase in site operations costs, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in payment processing costs driven by rate improvements\nand a $14 million decrease in\n46\nTable of Contents\ndepreciation expense due to the change in our estimate of the useful lives for our servers and networking equipment.\nThe increase in cost of net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was\nprimarily due to a $50 million increase related to indirect tax matters, a $41 million increase in cost of promoted listings products, a $30 million\nincrease related to eBay International Shipping and an $11 million disposition of data center equipment, partially offset by a $57 million decrease\nin depreciation expense due to the change in our estimate of the useful lives for our servers and networking equipment and a $36 million\ndecrease in payment processing costs driven by rate improvements.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents operating expenses for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nSales and marketing $ 592 $ 567 4 % $ 1,710 $ 1,644 4 %\nPercentage of net revenues 23 % 23 % 22 % 22 %\nProduct development 374 401 (7)% 1,104 1,145 (4)%\nPercentage of net revenues 15 % 16 % 14 % 15 %\nGeneral and administrative 194 283 (31)% 673 831 (19)%\nPercentage of net revenues 8 % 11 % 9 % 11 %\nProvision for transaction losses 89 85 4 % 266 259 3 %\nPercentage of net revenues 3 % 3 % 3 % 3 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 5 4 42 % 14 17 (12)%\nTotal operating expenses (1)(2) $ 1,254 $ 1,340 (6)% $ 3,767 $ 3,896 (3)%\n(1) Operating expenses were net of immaterial hedging activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of $1 million and a favorable impact of $2 million on operating expenses during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an unfavorable impact of $8 million and a favorable impact of $33 million during the same periods in 2023.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee\ncompensation (including stock-based compensation), certain user coupons and rewards, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on\nequipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and\ndisplay advertising. Offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023\nwas primarily due to a $31 million increase in online and offline marketing program costs inclusive of user coupons, partially offset by an\n$11 million decrease in employee-related costs.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023\nwas primarily due to a $118 million increase in online and offline marketing program costs inclusive of user coupons, partially offset by a\n$48 million decrease in employee-related costs.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs,\nfacilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other\nproduct development efforts, including the development and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include\nimproving seller tools and buyer experiences across our platforms powered by intelligent computing at scale.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in product development expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiods in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs. While employee costs are decreasing, we continue to invest in\nstrategic areas such as browsing experience, search optimization and providing relevant recommendations to enhance the experience for our\ncustomers around the world.\nCapitalized internal use and platform development costs were $27 million and $84 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $28 million and $86 million during the same periods in 2023. These costs are primarily reflected\nas a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs,\nfacilities costs, depreciation of equipment, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. Our legal expenses,\nincluding those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period\nin 2023 was primarily due to a $50 million legal accrual release during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a $50 million increase in the legal\naccrual recorded during the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $10 million contribution to the eBay Foundation during the third quarter of\n2024. See “Note 10 — Commitments and Contingencies” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for\nadditional details regarding our legal matters.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023 was primarily due to a $50 million legal accrual release during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a $50 million increase in the legal\naccrual recorded during the third quarter of 2023 and a $52 million decrease in one-time restructuring costs. See “Note 10 — Commitments and\nContingencies” and “Note 15 — Restructuring” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details\nregarding our legal matters and the restructuring, respectively.\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nProvision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from\nour managed payments services, fraud and bad debt expense. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many\nfactors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.\nThe increase in provision for transaction losses during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023 was primarily due to a prior year recovery that did not reoccur in the current periods.\n48\nTable of Contents\nGain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net\nGain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net primarily consists of gains and losses related to our various types of equity\ninvestments, including our equity investments in Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) and Gmarket Global LLC (“Gmarket”), and gains and losses due to\nchanges in fair value of the warrant received from Adyen N.V. (“Adyen”) and the Aurelia Option (as defined in “Note 5 — Investments”).

See “Note 5 — Investments” to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report for more information on the Adevinta Transactions and the Aurelia Option.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income and Other, Net\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest charges on amounts borrowed, commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit\nagreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. Interest income and other, net primarily\nconsists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and transaction costs\non acquisitions. The following table presents interest expense and interest income and other, net for the periods indicated (in millions, except\npercentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nInterest expense $ (63) $ (65) (3)% $ (194) $ (198) (2)%\nPercentage of net revenues (2)% (3)% (3)% (3)%\nInterest income $ 72 $ 58 24 % $ 196 $ 148 32 %\nForeign exchange and other (6) 1 ** 4 (1) **\nTotal interest income and other, net $ 66 $ 59 12 % $ 200 $ 147 36 %\nPercentage of net revenues 3 % 2 % 3 % 2 %\n** Not meaningful\n49\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a lower average notional\namount of outstanding debt compared to the same periods in 2023.\nInterest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher yields on interest bearing instruments.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome tax provision $ 161 $ 355 $ 360 $ 629\nEffective tax rate 20.2 % 21.4 % 21.7 % 23.5 %\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023\nwas primarily due to the excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation.\nIn addition, the decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023\nwas also due to the non-recurring increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2023.\nWe are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have been\nreserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although there are inherent uncertainties in these\nexaminations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments.\nHowever, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next 12 months. See “Note 13 — Income Taxes” to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next 12 months.\n50\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nContinuing operating activities $ 1,737 $ 2,308\nContinuing investing activities 951 520\nContinuing financing activities (2,814) (2,071)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 5 (16)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash - discontinued operations — (4)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (121) $ 737\nContinuing Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows arise primarily from cash received from our customers on our platforms offset by cash payments for sales and\nmarketing, employee compensation and payment processing expenses.\nCash provided by continuing operating activities of $1.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided\nby continuing operating activities of $2.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to working capital\nmovements and changes in non-cash items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nContinuing Investing Activities\nCash provided by continuing investing activities of $951 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to\nproceeds of $10.4 billion from the maturities and sales of investments and proceeds of $2.4 billion from the sale of our equity investment in\nAdevinta, partially offset by cash paid for investments of $11.5 billion and property and equipment of $341 million.\nThe largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our\ninvestments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.\nContinuing Financing Activities\nCash used in continuing financing activities of $2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to cash\npaid to repurchase $2.2 billion of common stock, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450%\nsenior notes and $405 million paid in cash dividends, partially offset by borrowings under our commercial paper program of $441 million.\nThe positive effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the weakening of the U.S.\ndollar against other currencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 year-end rate.\n51\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and\nlong-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include cash held\non behalf of customers related to marketplace activity of $679 million and $481 million, respectively, which are recorded separately within\ncustomer accounts and funds receivable with a corresponding liability within customer accounts and funds payable in our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet. These amounts also do not include restricted cash held for purposes of safeguarding customer funds of $104 million\nand $27 million, respectively. We believe these assets together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under\nour credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash\nrequirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty\nhave caused material disruptions in both U.S. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of\nthese events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we\ncannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not\nexperience other liquidity issues going forward.\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes.\nChanges in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments\ndiffering from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following sections\nsummarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments.\nSenior Notes\nOn August 1, 2024, we repaid the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450% senior notes on the date\nof maturity.\nIn January 2023, we repaid the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023 on the date\nof maturity.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had fixed-rate senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 billion, with $800 million\npayable within 12 months. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including,\namong other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions.\nCommercial Paper\nWe have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at\nmaturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, we issued and repaid $180 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities less than 90 days and issued\n$450 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities greater than 90 days. As of September 30, 2024, we had $450 million of\ncommercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.09% per annum, and a weighted average remaining term of 114\ndays.\nCredit Agreement\nIn March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion five-year credit facility (the “Prior Credit\nAgreement”).\n52\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2024, we terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that\nprovides for an unsecured $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders,\nincrease the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1.0 billion. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for\nworking capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and will bear interest at either (i) a customary forward-\nlooking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by CME Group for the relevant interest period plus an adjustment of\n0.1% or (ii) a customary base rate formula, plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0% to 0.375%. The covenants of the\nCredit Agreement are discussed in “Note 8 — Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $450 million of commercial paper notes outstanding; therefore, $1.6 billion of borrowing capacity was available for\nother purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nThe timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and\nthe number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized\ntax benefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $170 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments\nincluded assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $1.8 billion. As we repatriate these funds to the United States, we\nwill be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when\nsuch repatriation occurs. We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the United States. For additional details\nrelated to our income taxes, please see “Income Tax Provision” in our Results of Operations above and “Note 13 — Income Taxes” to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nStock Repurchases\nOur stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,\nsubject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our\noutstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be funded from our working capital or other financing\nalternatives.\nWe expect to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock, subject to market conditions and other\nuncertainties. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual\nnumber of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market\nconditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.\nIn February 2024, our Board authorized an incremental $2.0 billion under our stock repurchase program in addition to the $4.0 billion\npreviously authorized in 2022. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of our common stock under our stock\nrepurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately $1.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common\nstock. See “Note 11 — Stockholders’ Equity” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information\nabout our stock repurchase program.\nDividends\nThe Company paid a total of $131 million and $132 million in cash dividends during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $405 million and $399 million in cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. In October 2024, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on December 13, 2024 to\nstockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nOther Capital Resource Requirements\nWe actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the\nsafety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among\nvarious counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not\nexperienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no\nassurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the\nfinancial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, lower consumer spending\nand foreign exchange rate volatility. At any point in time, we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and\ninvested with third party financial institutions. We have entered into various indemnification agreements and, in the ordinary course of business,\nwe have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations. It is not\npossible to determine the maximum potential loss under these various indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated\nstatement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively. See “Note 10\n— Commitments and Contingencies” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our\nindemnification provisions.\n54\nTable of Contents\nItem 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events\n(including volatility or distress in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) may impact regional and global financial markets. These events and\nconditions could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from adverse economic\nconditions and events or changes in interest rates.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly\nincreasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents, customer accounts and short-term and long-term investments in a\nvariety of asset types, including bank deposits, government bonds and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 25%\nof our total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents and customer accounts. As such, changes in interest rates will impact\ninterest income. As discussed below, the fair market values of our fixed-rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates,\nand we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the balance of our corporate debt and government bond securities was $4.3 billion, which represented\napproximately 47% of our total cash and investments. Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying\ndegrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest\nrates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While\nfloating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income\nthan expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our\ninvestment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due\nto changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 1% (100 basis point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of\nour investments of $25 million and $20 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nFurther changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at\nfloating rates, and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and,\naccordingly, will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 8 — Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this report.\nEquity Price Risk\nEquity investments\nOur equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a\ncomponent of gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for\nunder the equity method of accounting, or the change in fair value of the equity method investments accounted for under the fair value option.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable\nprice changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of\nthe equity investment are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net. Equity investments under the fair value option are\nmeasured at fair value based on a quarterly valuation analysis and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation\nreflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. Subsequent changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our equity investments totaled $2.5 billion, which represented approximately 27% of our total cash and\ninvestments.\nFor additional details related to these investments, please see “Note 5 — Investments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this report.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWarrant\nWe entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,\nentitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. As\ndiscussed in “Note 6 — Derivative Instruments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, in 2021 we met the\nprocessing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant, and we exercised the option to purchase shares of Adyen. The\nremaining tranches of the warrant are accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in\nAdyen’s common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. As of September 30, 2024, a\nhypothetical one dollar change in the fair value of one share of Adyen’s common stock, holding other factors constant, would have increased or\ndecreased the fair value of the warrant by approximately $0.4 million. For additional details related to the warrant, please see “Note 6 —\nDerivative Instruments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOn October 15, 2024, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the second tranche of the Adyen warrant. Upon vesting of\nthe second tranche, we exercised the option to purchase approximately 404 thousand shares of Adyen valued at $630 million on the settlement\ndate of October 30, 2024 in exchange for $108 million in cash.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the\nBritish pound and euro, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various\nforeign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use\nof intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow and results of operations that are exposed to\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency\nfluctuations and related hedging activities.\nWe have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these\nexposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the\npurchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts\nis at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see\n“Note 6 — Derivative Instruments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate\nmovements. Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the\nderivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting\npurposes, the derivative’s gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain\nrevenue and costs are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting.\nThe following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign\nexchange contracts not designated for hedge accounting and the before-tax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign\nexchange rates that existed as of September 30, 2024. The sensitivity for foreign currency contracts is based on a 20% adverse change in\nforeign exchange rates, against relevant functional currencies.\nFair Value Asset\n(Liability) Fair Value Sensitivity\n(In millions)\nForeign exchange contracts - Cash flow hedges $ 6 $ (49)\nForeign exchange contracts - Not designated for hedge accounting $ (4) $ (75)\n56\nTable of Contents\nSince our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes\nin the value of the underlying exposure.\nWe also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate\nmovements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest income and\nother, net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in\nexchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an immaterial adverse\nimpact on income before income taxes as of September 30, 2024 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in\nplace as of September 30, 2024.\n57\nTable of Contents\nItem 4: Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) required by Exchange Act\nRules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n(b) Changes in internal controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act\nRule 13a-15(f)) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during our most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n58\nTable of Contents\nPART II: OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1: Legal Proceedings\nThe information set forth under “Note 10 — Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A: Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition including, not\nlimited to, those described in “Part I — Item 1A: Risk Factors” in the 2023 Form 10-K. Current global economic and geopolitical events and\nconditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks that we are not aware of or do\nnot believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. There have been no\nmaterial changes to the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nStock repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows:\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nTotal Number of Shares Shares that May\nTotal Number of Shares Average Price Paid Purchased as Part of Yet be Purchased Under the\nPeriod Ended Purchased per Share (2) Publicly Announced Programs Programs (1)\nJuly 31, 2024 5,329,862 $ 53.81 5,329,862 $ 1,661,686,085\nAugust 31, 2024 4,275,884 $ 57.00 4,275,884 $ 1,417,974,351\nSeptember 30, 2024 3,528,987 $ 62.20 3,528,987 $ 1,198,472,555\n13,134,733 13,134,733\n(1) Our stock repurchase program is intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other\nfactors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase\nprogram may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means\nat times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.\nIn February 2024, our Board authorized an incremental $2.0 billion under our stock repurchase program in addition to the $4.0 billion previously authorized in 2022. Our stock\nrepurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately $750 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, a total of approximately $1.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock.\nWe expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stock\nrepurchase program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.\n(2) Excludes broker commissions and excise tax accruals.\nItem 3: Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 4: Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 5: Other Information\nNot applicable.\n60\nTable of Contents\nItem 6: Exhibits\nThe information required by this Item is set forth in the Index to Exhibits of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nINDEX TO EXHIBITS\nFiled or furnished\nExhibit Number with this 10-Q Description\n3.01 Registrant’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (filed as Exhibit 3.1 to Registrant’s\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 23, 2023 (File No. 001-37713) and incorporated herein by\nreference).\n3.02 Registrant’s Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (filed as Exhibit 3.1 to Registrant’s Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed with the SEC on September 19, 2024 (File No. 001-37713) and incorporated herein by reference).\n10.01+ X Offer Letter dated September 4, 2024 between Registrant and Samantha Wellington.\n31.01 X Certification of Registrant’s Chief Executive Officer, as required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n31.02 X Certification of Registrant’s Chief Financial Officer, as required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n32.01 X Certification of Registrant’s Chief Executive Officer, as required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n32.02 X Certification of Registrant’s Chief Financial Officer, as required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n101 X The following materials from the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30,\n2024 were formatted in Inline XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language): (i) Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, (ii) Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, (iii) Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nComprehensive Income, (iv) Condensed Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity and (v) Condensed\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The estimated GAAP diluted EPS above includes approximately $70 million of gain upon the expiration of the Aurelia option but does not assume any gains or losses on our remaining equity investments.  \n  \n**eBay Inc.****Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance**\n\nTo supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow and figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis.\" These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, except for figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" can be found in the tables included in this press release. For figures in this press release reported on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" the company calculates the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates, excluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\n\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including changes in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\n\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes._ This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock option exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the company's operation of the business.\n\n_Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain gains or losses on investments._ The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.\n\n_Restructuring._ These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\n\n_Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results._ These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results. These amounts include changes in fair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.\n\n_Change in fair market value of warrant._ These are gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, which are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.\n\n_Income tax effects and adjustments._ We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay dividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period and does not exclude certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements.\n\n**eBay Inc** **Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income***  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In millions, except percentages)**  \nGAAP operating income | $ 595 | $ 455 | $ 1,775 | $ 1,531  \nStock-based compensation expense and related employerpayroll taxes | 149 | 146 | 457 | 436  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of netrevenues and operating expenses | 10 | 8 | 27 | 26  \nRestructuring | (4) | — | (10) | 42  \nNon-recurring legal matters | (50) | 50 | (56) | 50  \nOther general and administrative expenses | — | (1) | 1 | 1  \nTotal non-GAAP operating income adjustments | 105 | 203 | 419 | 555  \nNon-GAAP operating income | $ 700 | $ 658 | $ 2,194 | $ 2,086  \nGAAP operating margin | 23.1 % | 18.2 % | 23.0 % | 20.3 %  \nNon-GAAP operating margin | 27.2 % | 26.4 % | 28.5 % | 27.7 %  \n*Presented on a continuing operations basis  \n  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income and** **GAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In millions, except per share amounts and percentages)**  \nGAAP income from continuing operations before income taxes | $ 797 | $ 1,661 | $ 1,661 | $ 2,676  \nGAAP provision for income taxes | (161) | (355) | (360) | (629)  \nGAAP net income from continuing operations | $ 636 | $ 1,306 | $ 1,301 | $ 2,047  \nNon-GAAP adjustments to net income from continuing operations:  \nNon-GAAP operating income from continuing operationsadjustments (see table above) | $ 105 | $ 203 | $ 419 | $ 555  \nChange in fair value of equity investment in Adevinta | — | (1,367) | 234 | (1,331)  \nRealized change in fair value of shares sold in Adevinta | — | — | (78) | —  \nFair value of Aurelia option | (35) | — | 74 | —  \nChange in fair market value of warrant | (145) | 109 | (120) | 40  \nChange in fair market value of other equity investments | (18) | 46 | 11 | 95  \nIncome tax effects and adjustments | 45 | 248 | (3) | 294  \nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations | $ 588 | $ 545 | $ 1,838 | $ 1,700  \nDiluted net income from continuing operations per share:  \nGAAP | $ 1.29 | $ 2.46 | $ 2.57 | $ 3.81  \nNon-GAAP | $ 1.19 | $ 1.03 | $ 3.63 | $ 3.17  \nShares used in GAAP diluted net income per share calculation | 494 | 532 | 507 | 537  \nShares used in non-GAAP diluted net income per sharecalculation | 494 | 532 | 507 | 537  \nGAAP effective tax rate – Continuing operations | 20.2 % | 21.4 % | 21.7 % | 23.5 %  \nIncome tax effects and adjustments to net income fromcontinuing operations | (3.7) % | (4.9) % | (5.2) % | (7.0) %  \nNon-GAAP effective tax rate – Continuing operations | 16.5 % | 16.5 % | 16.5 % | 16.5 %  \n  \n**Reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In millions)**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities | $ 755 | $ 862 | $ 1,737 | $ 2,308  \nLess: Purchases of property and equipment | (109) | (85) | (341) | (330)  \nFree cash flow | $ 646 | $ 777 | $ 1,396 | $ 1,978  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF43922&sd=2024-10-30) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-302291997.html>\n\nSOURCE eBay Inc.\n\n[ Download PDF PDF Format (opens in new window) PDF 186 KB ](//ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Exhibit-99-1-ER-eBay-Q3-2024_FINAL.pdf)\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n## Contact Investor Relations\n\nFor financial inquiries, please contact our Investor Relations team. \n\n[Contact](/contact-us-and-resources/contact-us/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Alerts\n\nAutomatically receive eBay Inc. financial information by email. \n\n[Sign Up](/contact-us-and-resources/receive-notifications/default.aspx )\n"

This commitment drives us to regularly reflect on and assess our practices, policies and culture to ensure we’re staying true to our mission to connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all.\n\nSeveral months ago, in response to feedback from some investors, we began an independent third-party assessment of our values, including how we live our [Human Rights Policy Statement](https://www.ebayinc.com/company/human-rights-policy-statement/ \"https://www.ebayinc.com/company/human-rights-policy-statement/\"). That assessment has been completed, and we’d like to share an update.\n\n**Assessment Highlights**\n\n  * Stakeholder Engagement: The assessor interviewed and solicited written feedback from more than 35 people, including employees, management, and an external expert, to gather a range of perspectives on our workplace culture and policies.\n  * Document Review: The assessor reviewed our workplace policies, practices, surveys, training processes and other materials to evaluate our alignment with human rights standards and collective bargaining practices.\n  * Data Collection: Through interviews with key stakeholders, and a thorough review of our policies and processes, the assessor collected feedback to identify our strengths and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to share that the assessor recognized our commitment to our Human Rights Policy Statement. Specifically, the assessment concluded that: \n\n  * eBay is committed to encouraging employees to express their opinions and concerns;\n  * eBay has not interfered with employees’ free choice in deciding whether to join a union; and\n  * When bargaining with the union, eBay has acted consistently with its commitment to bargain in good faith.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps**\n\nAs requested, the assessor also identified areas where we had opportunity to better align our practices with our Human Rights Policy Statement and uphold our commitment to fair, inclusive processes. \n\nWe have taken those recommendations and have already begun to put the following enhancements in place:\n\n  * Supplementing the Human Rights Policy Statement with additional guidance on how it is implemented and enforced, formalizing the connection between our policies and existing practices;\n  * Identifying and implementing strategies to raise awareness around the Human Rights Policy Statement; and\n  * Establishing a cross-functional team with identified process owners to periodically review the Human Rights Policy Statement and monitor our adherence.\n\n\n\nWe extend our gratitude to everyone who participated in this assessment. Your voices have been essential in helping us ensure that we are living by our values. By listening, learning and growing together, we are building a stronger and more inclusive eBay.\n\nFor any additional questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to ebayassessment@dwt.com.\n\n[Share on LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F4hYUH01 \"Share on LinkedIn\") [Share on Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1641882702691765&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F40X6oOz&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Ffacebook-share-thank-you%2F \"Share on Facebook\") [Share on X (Twitter) ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F495MS4o&text=Living%20Our%20Values%20Assessment%20Update \"Share on X \\(Twitter\\)\") [Copy link to clipboard ](https://ebayinc.to/4hYUFFr \"Copy link to clipboard\") Copied!\n\nTopic: [Announcements](/stories/news/?topic=announcements \"More articles in Announcements\")\n\n[Back to Top](/stories/news/living-our-values-assessment-update/#skip-to-main) ![](//www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/living-our-values-assessment-update/ebi.gif) ![](https://t.co/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=a83ccaa9-416d-4c33-86dc-b124e2de464e&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=cd9f8abd-4210-415f-9f57-0736bb522220&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Fstories%2Fnews%2Fliving-our-values-assessment-update%2F&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o2r23&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=a83ccaa9-416d-4c33-86dc-b124e2de464e&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=cd9f8abd-4210-415f-9f57-0736bb522220&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Fstories%2Fnews%2Fliving-our-values-assessment-update%2F&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o2r23&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://t.co/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=3d472a88-436a-4ac6-aa9c-f564e98cc2e5&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=cd9f8abd-4210-415f-9f57-0736bb522220&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Fstories%2Fnews%2Fliving-our-values-assessment-update%2F&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o7ejw&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=3d472a88-436a-4ac6-aa9c-f564e98cc2e5&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=cd9f8abd-4210-415f-9f57-0736bb522220&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Fstories%2Fnews%2Fliving-our-values-assessment-update%2F&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o7ejw&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)\n"

What started in a two-car garage as a side hustle to fund his racing hobby has evolved into a 40,000-square-foot operation in Arizona stocked with parts for luxury vehicles.Now a world record-holding race car driver, Mark has established a brand and a reputation both on and off the track that set him apart in the high-end salvage industry. Today, he brings hard-to-find parts to car enthusiasts around the world, exclusively on eBay.We spoke with Mark of [AZ Cycle Parts](https://www.ebay.com/str/azcycleparts) to hear how he turned his racing dream into a multimillion-dollar eBay business, in his own words:\n\n###  Racing into the record books\n\nI'm an entrepreneur at heart and I love business, but racing is my passion. My brother was into Volkswagen Beetles back when I was five years old, so that’s when I caught the bug. I got into racing when I was 15, and ever since then, I’ve been hooked. It’s become a never-ending pursuit to go faster.After drag racing for almost 20 years, I moved into half-mile racing on airport runways, where you go from a standing stop to covering a half-mile distance as fast as you can. Just this year, I was able to set the world record for the fastest on earth in half mile racing with my Underground Racing Lamborghini STO at 260.72 miles an hour.[![Mark Rau seller spotlight](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-1600x-image-1.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-1600x-image-1.jpg)\n\n###  From race car driver to reseller \n\nMy eBay journey began as a way to fund my racing pursuits. When I was a teenager in Wisconsin, I used eBay to make money to buy and race cars. I’m from very humble beginnings. Having an eBay side hustle made racing possible, and allowed me to grow into what I am today – one of the top high-end auto salvage sellers on eBay.Back in the early days of the business, I’d go to auto swap meets to find items I could sell and flip. I figured out really quickly that if I bought a vehicle and took it apart, I could make three, four, or five times as much money.I made the leap to selling full-time on eBay when the economy crashed in 2008. I had been working in the aerospace industry and was let go, so I decided to take the plunge. I cashed out everything I had and started selling out of a two-car garage at my house. Now we've grown into a 40,000-square-foot, all-indoors, climate-controlled warehouse.[![Seller spotlight Mark Rau](assets/Uploads/Editor/241119-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v2-inc-16x9-image-quote-1.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241119-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v2-inc-16x9-image-quote-1.jpg)\n\n### Sourcing high-end inventory from coast to coast \n\nWe carry parts for exotic cars such as Ferrari and McLaren, but also muscle cars, enthusiast cars, motorcycles, UTVs, and more. We’re always looking for niche, unique products and we source vehicles from insurance salvage auctions and dealer networks, all across the United States. I'm buying online all the time, and we process two vehicles every day.We set ourselves apart from the competition by carrying a vast product line on eBay that no one else in the industry can match. Our high inventory allows us to have smaller margins, and our cash reserves allow us to invest more in products and sell them for more.Staying up on the trends is what differentiates us as well. When a new model comes out, we get it, part it out, and take it to market with a product offering.\n\n[![Seller Spotlight Mark Rau](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-2.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-2.jpg)\n\n###  A commitment to quality and customer service\n\nWe have a staff of ten, and we’re committed to quality. Every part we sell is inspected and tested to make sure it’s in good working order. We take a lot of care – from the photography team, who take excellent photos, to the shipping team, who package the items when they go out the door so they're not damaged in transit.All of our products ship out with FedEx. It costs us a bit more, but it gets the product to the customer around two days faster than any other service. And that's why our buyer feedback is so strong. The number one thing we hear from our customers is, “Wow, I can't believe how fast I got the part. I ordered it two days ago, and it's already at my doorstep.”[![Seller Spotlight Mark Rau](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-quote-2.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-quote-2.jpg)\n\n### Keeping his business on track with eBay tools \n\nThere are a few eBay tools that have been absolutely crucial to our business. We use [myFitment](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/ebay-fitment-plus) heavily on most of our listings to expand our reach and show compatibility with various years, makes, and models. It provides missing fitment information on new listings we post.[eBay International Shipping](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/shipping/ebay-international-shipping) has been a godsend for us. It’s eliminated a lot of the headaches and paperwork that come with selling to customers around the world. It’s a simple process: we put the product in a box and ship it to the terminal – and from there, we know we’re covered 100%. We probably sell 15 to 20% of all our products through eIS, and it's been a game changer.Also, the new Seller Dashboard and [Seller Hub](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/seller-hub) have had huge returns for our business. We experiment with different styles of promoting, sales, and offsite advertising. These advantages are relatively new to sellers, and it’s great to be able to put a few marketing dollars here and a few ad dollars there and see results. It’s been a big success for us.\n\n[![Seller Spotlight Mark Rau](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-3.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241112-Seller-spotlight-AZCycles-v1-inc-16x9-image-3.jpg)\n\n###  His advice for aspiring sellers \n\nTo turn your side hustle into a thriving business, you have to outwork everyone else. You gotta put in the time and the grind, and it's not gonna happen overnight. If you're just out to make a buck, you’ll fail. But if your focus is on taking care of your client and your customer and building a solid reputation, that's how you’ll last. It took me 15 years of grind to build a brand that I could leverage to become what we are now – a multimillion dollar business.As a high-end seller, you have to have an excellent reputation. A buyer isn’t going to spend thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on a part for a Lamborghini or a McLaren or a Ferrari from somebody unknown. So you need to build your brand before jumping into that market. And you’ll need some pretty deep pockets to allow yourself to sit on that product because it doesn’t sell overnight.\n\n### Turning his American Dream into reality\n\nI'm as loyal of an eBay seller as you'll ever find. I'm just so thankful that there’s a platform that allows an average person like me to succeed as an entrepreneur. I didn’t come from any great beginnings. I'm just a regular dude. And the fact that I can reach such a broad range of customers around the world is incredible.It’s pretty surreal to feel like I’ve made it. I’m from a small town in the Midwest and I’ve basically achieved the American Dream. The eBay platform has allowed me to create my dream and turn my success story into a reality. Without eBay and eBay Motors, I wouldn’t be where I am today._Explore our[Seller Community page](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/bg-p/Announcements) to read more stories about eBay businesses._\n\n[Share on LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F3ZeiilO \"Share on LinkedIn\") [Share on Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1641882702691765&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F3Zc1Oe0&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebayinc.com%2Ffacebook-share-thank-you%2F \"Share on Facebook\") [Share on X (Twitter) ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Febayinc.to%2F3YSvifL&text=One%20of%20the%20World%E2%80%99s%20Fastest%20Race%20Car%20Drivers%20is%20a%20Top%20eBay%20Motors%20Seller \"Share on X \\(Twitter\\)\") [Copy link to clipboard ](https://ebayinc.to/3AWyRcH \"Copy link to clipboard\") Copied!\n\nTopic: [Customers](/stories/news/?topic=customers \"More articles in Customers\")\n\n[Back to Top](/stories/news/one-of-the-worlds-fastest-race-car-drivers-is-a-top-ebay-motors-seller/#skip-to-main) ![](//www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/one-of-the-worlds-fastest-race-car-drivers-is-a-top-ebay-motors-seller/ebi.gif)\n"

Homes For Our Troops builds and donates specially adapted homes across the U.S. for post-9/11 veterans who have experienced severe injuries. These homes are more than just a place to live: they’re a critical step toward restored independence, giving veterans the stability to focus on their families, healing, and building their futures.\n\nFor Renee Gugliotta, Deputy Director of Marketing at Homes for Our Troops, the auction’s ongoing success is a testament to the power of community. \n\n“Each bid in this auction empowers our veterans to live safely and independently, and it brings together communities across the nation—families, neighbors, and supporters—who honor the sacrifices they have made. It’s this collective strength and compassion that truly makes a difference in the lives of those who have given so much for our country,” said Renee.\n\n2024 has been a landmark year for the organization.\n\n“This year, we’re celebrating our 20th anniversary and the incredible milestone of donating our 400th specially adapted custom home,” said Renee. “We are grateful for the enduring support of our donors, partners, volunteers, celebrities, and public figures who contribute their time and effort to our mission.”\n\n### Star-Studded Support for the Troops\n\nEvery year, the auction rallies an ever-growing and illustrious community in support of veterans. Celebrities like Jake Tapper, George Clooney, Mindy Kaling, and Wynonna Judd host and amplify the event, while the eBay for Charity platform extends the auction across the globe. \n\nThis year’s auction features exclusive items and experiences from notable celebrities, including:\n\n  * 18 holes of golf with Jason Bateman and Will Arnett\n\n  * A cameo in “Gone Girl\" author Gillian Flynn’s next novel\n\n  * A zoom call with Bryan Cranston\n\n  * A meet & greet with Will Ferrell on the set of his next production\n\n  * Field passes, tickets, and VIP access to top sports teams like the San Francisco 49ers, Boston Red Sox, and more\n\n  * A Game of Thrones stunt team jacket\n\n\n\n\n[![241031 VeteransDay v1 inc 16x9 image 4](assets/Uploads/Editor/241031-VeteransDay-v1-inc-16x9-image-4.jpg)](assets/Uploads/Editor/241031-VeteransDay-v1-inc-16x9-image-4.jpg)\n\n### eBayers Rally for Our Military Communities\n\nThe Homes For Our Troops auction is just one of the many ways eBayers can show up for our military communities this November. \n\neBay’s [HONOR](https://jobs.ebayinc.com/us/en/honor-role-apprenticeship-program) COI has selected HFOT as a featured charity for eBay for Charity’s Give at Checkout, running from November 10-20.

He’ll share his incredible experience transitioning from military service to entrepreneurship, and chat about his book. This special event will be followed by a Happy Hour at The Sellar. \n\nHONOR and Darren Walton will also generously donate five signed copies of his book for inclusion in the HFOT auction.\n\n**About Homes For Our Troops:** Homes For Our Troops (HFOT) is a publicly funded 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization that builds and donates specially adapted custom homes nationwide for severely injured post-9/11 Veterans, to enable them to rebuild their lives. Most of these Veterans have sustained injuries including multiple limb amputations, partial or full paralysis, and/or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). These homes restore some of the freedom and independence our Veterans sacrificed while defending our country, and enable them to focus on their family, recovery, and rebuilding their lives. Since its inception in 2004, nearly 90 cents out of every dollar spent has gone directly to our program services for Veterans. HFOT builds these homes where the Veteran chooses to live and continues its relationship with the Veterans after home delivery to assist them with rebuilding their lives.
