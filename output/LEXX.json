(NASDAQ:LEXX)(NASDAQ:LEXXW) (the “Company” or “Lexaria”), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, provides the following strategic update.\n\nToday’s GLP-1 drug market consists primarily of semaglutide (Wegovy®, Ozempic®, and Rybelsus®), owned by Novo Nordisk®; and tirzepatide (Zepbound®, Mounjaro®), owned by Eli Lilly™. All five of those drug brands, with the exception of Rybelsus®, are administered by injection, whereas Rybelsus® is the only oral tablet currently approved by the FDA today. While these two drugs were originally approved by the FDA for diabetes management, weight-loss approvals soon followed and [Wegovy® was also approved by the FDA](https://pr.report/4ja2) in March 2024 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke.\n\nAcceptance and use of these two drugs by the public has resulted in unprecedented demand, with estimates of 2024 revenue between them of [~$30 billion, compared to just $300 million in 2018](https://pr.report/4ja3), an increase of 100x or 10,000%.\n\n“The GLP-1 market may be the most significant development in pharmaceutical achievements of our lifetimes,” said Richard Christopher, CEO of Lexaria. “Given the relatively early stage of investigation and development of these drugs, we simply do not know how big of an impact they will have, but it is safe to say that nearly every person in Europe or North America could experience improvement in their own health, or the health of a loved one, from GLP-1 drugs.”\n\nSome are asking whether this trend is a temporary one-off event and whether the recent revenue growth is sustainable; whereas there is a growing realization that – not only is this NOT a temporary event – future revenue growth is likely to be even _stronger_ than that seen in recent years.\n\nThere are two main reasons for the [growing consensus that revenue in the GLP-1 drug sector will soon be over $100 billion per year](https://pr.report/4ja4): one is that the patient population for diabetes, weight loss, and heart disease is massive and growing, with these drugs demonstrating good overall safety and efficacy. The other reason is that it seems quite likely that the therapeutic benefits from using these drugs is poised for significant expansion based on the evidence that is continually being updated.\n\n**Cardiovascular Disease**\n\nRecently, Novo Nordisk® announced that Rybelsus® demonstrated a [14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events](https://pr.report/4ja5) in adults with type 2 diabetes, in a large Phase III trial of 9,650 people. With Wegovy® already FDA-approved for certain cardiovascular disease treatments, Novo Nordisk® will [now be seeking FDA approval](https://pr.report/4ja6) of Rybelsus® for similar use.\n\n**Liver Disease**\n\nThere are currently no FDA-approved treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”) liver disease, or [for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease](https://pr.report/4ja7). [GLP-1RAs have been reported to reduce liver fat content](https://pr.report/4ja8) and liver enzymes, reduce oxidative stress and improve hepatic de novo lipogenesis and the histopathology of MASH. The MASH treatment market is [forecasted to possibly reach $20 billion](https://pr.report/4ja9) by 2032. Of the several leading pharmaceutical companies exploring treatment options for MASH, Pfizer is investigating its own GLP-1 molecule, danuglipron, as a potential daily tablet solution but is too early in its development to have received FDA approval at this time.\n\nIn 2020, [Merck® agreed to pay up to $860 million](https://pr.report/4jaa) in milestone payments to acquire the rights and licence to efinopegdutide, a GLP-1/GIP drug that was granted a Fast Track designation from the FDA in 2023 for the treatment of MASH.\n\nBoehringer Ingelheim® has also been granted a Fast Track designation from the FDA for its molecule [survodutide, yet another GLP-1 drug](https://pr.report/4jab) originally designed for application with obesity but now additionally being examined for certain liver diseases.\n\n**Sleep Apnea, Knee Pain**\n\nFollowing a Phase III study that showed an astonishing 63% reduction in apnea-hypopnea, Eli Lilly™ announced it would be seeking FDA approval for [Zepbound® to be used for treating sleep apnea](https://pr.report/4jac). Eli Lilly™ is also investigating its triple-agonist drug, [retatrutide, for use in knee osteoarthritis](https://pr.report/4jad) as well as sleep apnea.\n\nNot to be outdone, Novo Nordisk® has also reported that those who are overweight place additional stress on the knee and its protective cartilage and that [in a study of 407 people diagnosed with knee arthritis](https://pr.report/4jae), knee pain was reduced more thoroughly when those patients were treated with semaglutide than when they received a placebo.\n\n**Alzheimer’s and Dementia**\n\nWhile GLP-1 drugs are known for triggering gastro-intestinal effects that create a sense of fullness, thus facilitating the treatment of obesity and diabetes, many investors have not yet realized that GLP-1 and related drugs have actions at main types of human brain receptors. Commercially available [GLP-1 drugs have already shown an ability to bind](https://pr.report/4jaf) with those receptors, but if and only if they are capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier sufficiently upon administration. Lexaria has repeatedly shown, in [previous studies](https://pr.report/4jag) with other drugs, that its DehydraTECH technology can at times improve the delivery of drugs into brain tissue. Lexaria’s recently completed animal study [WEIGHT-A24-1](https://pr.report/4jah), is investigating for the brain absorption of DehydraTECH-processed GLP-1 drugs in study animals with data pending and expected to be released in either December, or in January, 2025.\n\nDulaglutide, owned by Eli Lilly™, is a GLP-1 drug that has shown a particular affinity to enter the brain, and, in [a large human study of 8,828 participants](https://pr.report/4jai), it has shown a significant benefit to cognition.\n\nAs well, liraglutide, owned by Novo Nordisk®, has also evidenced an ability to slow cognitive decline in a Phase 2b clinical trial, and [reduce shrinkage of those areas of the brain that control memory, learning, and language](https://pr.report/4jaj) by nearly 50% as compared to placebo. [Semaglutide is also showing promising early-stage reduced risks](https://pr.report/4jak) against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.\n\n**Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\nEli Lilly™ is conducting active research including a Phase II study expected to complete in early 2026, examining [tirzepatide as a possible treatment for chronic kidney disease](https://pr.report/4jal) (“CKD”). If successful it is reasonable to expect Eli Lilly™ to progress to Phase III development and ultimately apply to the FDA for approval of the use of tirzepatide to treat this often life-threatening condition if successful.\n\nFurther, in a large [analysis of over 165,000 patients](https://pr.report/4jam), type-2 diabetic patients with acute kidney disease receiving GLP-1 drugs evidenced lower mortality rates and lower incidences of both major cardiovascular events and major adverse kidney events, than those patients not receiving GLP-1 drugs.\n\nAs well, Novo Nordisk® has earlier announced a successful outcome of a human trial of 3,533 people with CKD and type 2 diabetes using injected semaglutide. The study “demonstrated a [statistically significant and superior reduction in kidney disease](https://pr.report/4jan) progression as well as cardiovascular and kidney death of 24%.”\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe applications of GLP-1 and related drugs are still being identified. Given the widespread and rapid adoption of these drugs by tens of millions of people, data is being generated in real time at a scale never encountered before. The benefits of weight loss and diabetic control are obvious though not even close to being fully realized at this time, while the benefits in other areas of human health are still being discovered. Lexaria intends to continue research and development of its DehydraTECH drug delivery platform technology with as many GLP-1 and related drug molecules as it possibly can, in an attempt to identify broad areas of prospective commercial applicability for it to continue to participate in arguably the most exciting field of drug development in modern times.\n\n**About Lexaria Bioscience Corp.**\n\nLexaria Bioscience Corp.’s patented drug delivery technology, DehydraTECH™, improves the way active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) enter the bloodstream by promoting more effective oral delivery. Since 2016, DehydraTECH has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to increase bio-absorption with cannabinoids, antiviral drugs, GLP-1 and more. DehydraTECH has also evidenced an ability to deliver some drugs more effectively across the blood brain barrier. Lexaria operates a licensed in-house research laboratory and holds a robust intellectual property portfolio with 46 patents granted and many patents pending worldwide.

(Nasdaq:LEXX)(Nasdaq:LEXXW) (the “Company” or “Lexaria”), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms is pleased to announce that dosing has been completed for human pilot study #3 (the “Study”) investigating a DehydraTECH-processed version of the dual action glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) + glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (“GIP”) receptor agonist tirzepatide (sold commercially as Zepbound®) in an oral dose format.\n\nThe Study has been dosed in nine (9) healthy volunteers. The final seven-day dosing phase, wherein all subjects received the opposite treatment condition from that which they received during the initial dosing phase, was completed on November 16th. The initial dosing phase of either a seven-day regimen of oral DehydraTECH-processed tirzepatide capsules or a single injected tirzepatide dose was [reported upon](https://pr.report/4i07) positively several weeks ago.\n\nNo serious adverse events have been observed thus far during both dosing visits, which serves as a point of interest given Lexaria’s desire to create an effective oral version of Eli Lilly’s™ tirzepatide products, which currently only exist in an injectable form.\n\nThe DehydraTECH composition for the Study was compound-formulated using the commercially available Zepbound® injectable formulation as the tirzepatide input material. Tolerability (side effects), blood absorption levels (pharmacokinetics or “PK”), and blood sugar control are being evaluated in the Study.\n\nTirzepatide is currently approved for use in the United States under the brand names Zepbound® and Mounjaro®, both owned by Eli Lilly™. These two brands combined are [expected to generate approximately $15 billion](https://pr.report/4i08) in revenue in 2024. Eli Lilly™ recently announced that tirzepatide [evidenced a 94% reduction in risk of progression to type 2 diabetes](https://pr.report/4i09) over a three-year study, and a reduction of 23% of bodyweight, on average, maintained for three years.\n\nIn two [previous human pilot studies](https://pr.report/4i0a), Lexaria has evidenced that the oral administration of semaglutide (sold by Novo Nordisk® under the brands Rybelsus®, Ozempic®, and Wegovy®) processed with DehydraTECH yielded improvements in absorption rates and a reduction in both blood sugar and in adverse events, as compared to Rybelsus® tablets alone. The two drugs, semaglutide and tirzepatide, are believed to constitute over 90% of all revenue generated in the GLP-1 / GIP sector today.\n\nThrough the Study, Lexaria is attempting to evidence meaningful absorption rates of tirzepatide in an oral format, which is not available in the market today since it is currently administered only by injection. The Company expects that data analysis will occur in December with results available in January, 2025.\n\n**About the Study**\n\nMany design characteristics of the Study, also referred to as Study GLP-1-H24-3, are similar to Lexaria’s initial GLP-1 human pilot study #1. The DehydraTECH-tirzepatide test articles were compound formulated using Zepbound®, strictly for research purposes, and dosed to the subjects under fasted conditions. The Study is designed to measure tolerability and side effects, blood levels of tirzepatide, and blood glucose levels. The DehydraTECH-tirzepatide composition was formulated at a strength of 20 mg tirzepatide administered orally daily for seven days. The Zepbound® formulation had a strength of 2.5 mg tirzepatide administered once via injection with the subject monitored over the same seven-day duration applicable with the oral DehydraTECH-tirzepatide condition. Blood samples were taken multiple times during the first 12 hours post dosing on the first day of each treatment phase, with a final blood draw taken 24 hours after dosing; and, a standardized meal was fed to the test subjects at a point in time after dosing. Single blood samples were also taken daily on each of the second through eighth days following commencement of each dosing visit. A total of 9 healthy subjects completed dosing with each test article following a randomized, cross over study design across two study phases.\n\n**About Lexaria Bioscience Corp.**\n\nLexaria Bioscience Corp.’s patented drug delivery technology, DehydraTECH™, improves the way active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) enter the bloodstream by promoting more effective oral delivery.

(NASDAQ:LEXX)(NASDAQ:LEXXW) (the “Company” or “Lexaria”), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms announces that it has received final 12-week body weight and blood sugar results from all 12 study groups of the recently completed diabetes animal study WEIGHT-A24-1 (the “Study”).\n\nThe Study results were highlighted by the fact that all groups utilizing Lexaria’s proprietary DehydraTECH technology outperformed Rybelsus® in body weight-control, as well as experienced body weight-control improvement during the final 4-weeks of the Study.\n\nFurthermore, in all but group A, by week 12, the degree of improvement over Rybelsus® in body weight-control was statistically significant, p<0.05. Also of note were the top performing DehydraTECH-liraglutide and DehydraTECH-CBD groups (H and B). These groups outperformed the Rybelsus® control group by week 12 in body weight-control by 11.53% (p<0.0001) and 10.65% (p=0.0002) respectively and in blood sugar control by 11.13% (p=0.0395) and 3.35% (p=0.3853) respectively.\n\nThis Study was specifically designed to perpetuate a diabetic condition throughout the 12-week duration by offering the animals unlimited food and water, 24-hours per day, in order to examine and compare the _relative_ performance of each Study group. It was _not_ designed to maximize weight loss or blood glucose reduction and, therefore, its results should not be compared to third-party weight loss studies specifically optimized for those purposes. Accordingly, weight _gain_ would not be an unexpected outcome of the Study, especially with orally administered glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) drugs that are specifically designed to be taken by humans on an empty stomach after overnight fasting.\n\nStudy group “K” was a placebo wherein the animals only received water in lieu of any drug (the “Placebo Group”). The animals in the Placebo Group experienced an average weight gain of 1.40%, and an average increase in blood sugar of 10.33% over the Study duration. These are the benchmarks used for comparative purposes.\n\nStudy group “L” was a positive control wherein the animals received unadulterated Rybelsus® as the only FDA-approved oral GLP-1 drug on the market today, to utilize as a so-called “standard of care” (the “SOC Group”). The animals in the SOC Group experienced an average weight _gain_ of 5.65%, and an average reduction in blood sugar of -0.41% over the Study duration.\n\nAll three of the DehydraTECH-semaglutide groups (E, F, and G) achieved superior body weight-control results throughout the duration of the Study than both the Placebo Group and the SOC Group. Notably, the DehydraTECH-semaglutide groups included formulations created using Rybelsus® as the semaglutide input (E and F) and a formulation created using pure semaglutide drug substance as the semaglutide input (G) without the salcaprozate sodium (“SNAC”) technology integral to Novo Nordisk’s commercially available Rybelsus® product performance.\n\nThose same three groups (E, F, and G) achieved mostly superior blood sugar control results as compared to the Placebo Group throughout the duration of the Study and mostly superior blood sugar control results as compared to the SOC Group at the 4th and 8th week durations, but inferior results compared to the SOC Group by the 12th week duration.\n\nMost of the DehydraTECH-CBD formulation groups (A, B, C, and D) achieved their best weight-control performance during the final 4 weeks of the Study, implying that a longer-term study may be required to determine the full extent of weight loss possible with DehydraTECH-CBD. Those same four formulation groups (A, B, C, and D) all achieved superior blood sugar control performance than the Placebo Group at the 8th and 12th week, and mostly superior blood sugar control performance to SOC Group at the 4th and 8th week periods. The SOC Group achieved its best blood sugar control in the final four weeks of the study.\n\n**Animal Weights**(grams)\n\n**Study Groups** |  **End of****Acclimation Period** |  **Day****28** |  **% Change****to Day 28** |  **Day****56** |  **% Change****to Day 56** |  **Day****84** |  **% Change****to Day 84**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**A: DHT-CBD1** |  427.9 |  432.6 |  +1.10% |  438.0 |  +2.36% |  432.3 |  +1.05%  \n**B: DHT-CBD2** |  394.6 |  393.3 |  -0.33% |  386.1 |  -2.15% |  374.9 |  -5.00%  \n**C: DHT-CBD3** |  416.0 |  408.8 |  -1.72% |  407.3 |  -2.08% |  402.5 |  -3.24%  \n**D: DHT-CBD4** |  431.2 |  431.7 |  +0.11% |  434.2 |  +0.69% |  419.0 |  -2.83%  \n**E: DHT-Rybelsus1** w/SNAC |  394.9 |  394.6 |  -0.06% |  401.4 |  +1.65% |  393.6 |  -0.32%  \n**F: DHT-Rybelsus2** w/SNAC |  406.2 |  409.1 |  +0.70% |  406.7 |  +0.11% |  403.1 |  -0.78%  \n**G: DHT-Semaglutide** No SNAC |  394.2 |  394.8 |  +0.15% |  399.0 |  +1.21% |  394.1 |  -0.02%  \n**H: DHT-Liraglutide** No SNAC |  392.2 |  385.7 |  -1.65% |  373.6 |  -4.74% |  369.1 |  -5.88%  \n**I: DHT-Combo****CBD3©+Semaglutide(G)** No SNAC |  440.8 |  453.3 |  +2.84% |  448.6 |  +1.77% |  444.1 |  +0.75%  \n**J: DHT-Combo****CBD3©+Liraglutide(H)** No SNAC |  446.7 |  468.7 |  +4.93% |  463.4 |  +3.74% |  451.4 |  +1.05%  \n**K: Vehicle Control****(Placebo)** |  427.7 |  442.5 |  +3.46% |  440.1 |  +2.90% |  433.7 |  +1.40%  \n**L: Rybelsus Control**(SOC)w/SNAC (No DehydraTECH) |  430.2 |  446.7 |  +3.84% |  459.2 |  +6.74% |  454.5 |  +5.65%  \n  \nNotes\n\n– Groups A through D were different DehydraTECH-CBD compositions– Groups E and F were reformulated Rybelsus DehydraTECH compositions– Groups G and H used pure GLP-1 drugs (semaglutide and liraglutide respectively) in DehydraTECH compositions– Recalculations led to slight changes from earlier reported data– Group K received only water as a placebo control versus the other groups that received water+drug at dosing– Group L received unadulterated Rybelsus® with no DehydraTECH processing\n\nBoth of the combination drug groups (I and J) achieved superior body-weight control performance to both the Placebo Group and SOC Group at the 12th week, but inferior blood sugar control across most time points.\n\n**Blood Sugar Levels**(mmol/L)\n\n**Study Groups** |  **End of Acclimation Period** |  **Day****28** |  **% Change****to Day 28** |  **Day****56** |  **% Change****to Day 56** |  **Day****84** |  **% Change****to Day 84**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**A: DHT-CBD1** |  27.4 |  26.2 |  -4.31% |  26.9 |  -1.90% |  27.7 |  1.09%  \n**B: DHT-CBD2** |  28.4 |  29.2 |  2.73% |  26.6 |  -6.22% |  27.3 |  -3.76%  \n**C: DHT-CBD3** |  26.4 |  24.9 |  -5.99% |  27.1 |  2.46% |  27.5 |  3.85%  \n**D: DHT-CBD4** |  24.6 |  27.9 |  13.16% |  26.8 |  8.94% |  27.0 |  9.75%  \n**E: DHT-Rybelsus1** w/SNAC |  26.4 |  25.5 |  -3.60% |  26.8 |  1.33% |  26.8 |  1.59%  \n**F: DHT-Rybelsus2** w/SNAC |  24.9 |  26.8 |  7.70% |  26.4 |  5.96% |  27.3 |  9.58%  \n**G: DHT-Semaglutide** No SNAC |  26.3 |  25.9 |  -1.52% |  27.8 |  5.54% |  26.9 |  2.13%  \n**H: DHT-Liraglutide** No SNAC |  26.4 |  25.8 |  -2.08% |  25.2 |  -4.56% |  23.3 |  -11.54%  \n**I: DHT-Combo****CBD3©+Semaglutide(G)** No SNAC |  25.1 |  27.2 |  8.37% |  28.2 |  12.35% |  26.8 |  6.77%  \n**J: DHT-Combo****CBD3©+Liraglutide(H)** No SNAC |  23.5 |  27.0 |  14.89% |  27.0 |  14.89% |  26.4 |  12.34%  \n**K: Vehicle Control (Placebo)** |  24.2 |  25.7 |  6.2% |  27.7 |  14.46% |  26.7 |  10.33%  \n**L: Rybelsus Control**(SOC)w/SNAC (No DehydraTECH) |  24.3 |  25.1 |  3.29% |  26.1 |  7.41% |  24.2 |  -0.41%  \n  \nThe two groups of the Study (I and J), that combined doses of either DehydraTECH-semaglutide or DehydraTECH-liraglutide with DehydraTECH-CBD were generally worse performers than either of the drugs alone with respect to blood sugar control, although, regarding reduced body-weight control, they were nonetheless generally superior to both the Placebo Group and the SOC Group.\n\n“Overall, the findings from our animal study showed benefits of DehydraTECH-processing with all drugs studied alone or in combination relative to the Rybelsus® control formulation,” said John Docherty, President & CSO of Lexaria Bioscience Corp. “This Study is strongly supportive of our plans to advance to our upcoming [Phase 1b chronic dosing clinical study](https://pr.report/4evj) in Australia through our Australian subsidiary, Lexaria (AU) Pty Ltd, which we have endeavoured to design to allow for maximum impacts upon blood glucose and body weight control while also evaluating safety and tolerability in humans.”\n\nAll body weight and blood glucose findings from the Study, including from the SOC Group and Placebo Group, have now been received. Additional data processing and interpretation remains, including the analyses of brain and blood absorption pharmacokinetic results and more. Lexaria has not yet received this data from the third-party lab and will report upon same when results are available.\n\n**About the Study** The Study model selected – diabetic Zucker rates with unlimited food and water provided 24 hours per day – is a more stringent model design than that used in most studies primarily focused on weight loss. As such, it is expected that weight loss results within this Study would be less than other third-party weight loss studies and that weight gain would not be unexpected. The _primary_ rational for conducting this Study was to perform a _relative_ comparison of many different formulations and test for relative differences between them in a diabetic state purposefully perpetuated for the duration of the Study. Future animal work that is primarily focused on weight loss – already under design by Lexaria – will use a study model more typical of weight loss studies that do not provide 24-hour unlimited food and water.\n\nStudy WEIGHT-A24-1 was completed using diabetic, pre-conditioned Zucker rats. Each group of the Study was dosed for a 12-week period following the initial acclimation period. During the Study, over 1,500 blood plasma samples were collected from the total starting rat population of 72 animals for purposes of detailed PK drug delivery analyses. Because of the small animal population in each Study group, statistical significance was not necessarily expected – though achieved in some instances – and commentary on apparent trends has been noted. Body weight and blood glucose readings were taken prior to Study start continuing at regular intervals during and at conclusion of the dosing period. Brain tissue is also in the process of being analysed to help determine whether DehydraTECH processing results in higher brain absorption than non-DehydraTECH groups, as Lexaria has evidenced numerous times in previous animal studies. The Study also included a comprehensive battery of liver and kidney function testing and blood chemistry analyses that remain to be analysed and reported. [LC-MS/MS](https://pr.report/4evk) and other techniques were used to analyse samples.\n\n**About Lexaria Bioscience Corp. & DehydraTECH**DehydraTECH™ is Lexaria’s patented drug delivery formulation and processing platform technology which improves the way active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) enter the bloodstream through oral delivery.

(NASDAQ:LEXX)(NASDAQ:LEXXW) (the “Company” or “Lexaria”), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, announces it has engaged a contract research organization to perform the world’s first-ever fluorescently tagged DehydraTECH-semaglutide (“FTS”) rodent [biodistribution study](https://pr.report/48u8) (the “Study”).\n\nDistribution of a drug once it enters the body can provide vital clues as to the understanding of that drug’s ability to bind with targeted receptor cells, avoid concentration at physical sites that might be prone to fostering adverse side effects, and increase the drug’s ultimate efficacy. Lexaria hopes to discover whether the DehydraTECH processing of semaglutide improves its biodistribution in any significant way compared to conventional orally administered semaglutide formulation practices.\n\nThe FTS will be tracked via fluorescent imaging detection to evidence how and where the semaglutide distributes and localizes following oral ingestion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Later in the Study, the animals will be euthanized and various key tissues will be examined including the brain, pancreas, lung, kidney, liver and heart for more detailed fluorescent imaging detection showing very specific tissue localization patterns and concentrations.\n\nLexaria has already begun the early-stage collaboration with the third-party laboratory that will synthesize the FTS that will then be used to create the DehydraTECH-semaglutide test articles. There will be two different test articles manufactured and tested:\n\n  * FTS will be combined with ingredients in the proportions used within the Rybelsus® orally-administered product sold today designed to mimic Rybelsus® performance, without DehydraTECH processing.\n\n  * FTS will be combined with patented DehydraTECH ingredients and processes to evidence potential biodistribution differences when DehydraTECH is used compared to the Rybelsus®-mimicking control FTS formulation.\n\n\n\n\nThe Study will also include use of certain glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) receptor specific antibodies detectable through an immunofluorescence methodology to allow the analytical laboratory to confirm the extent of GLP-1 receptor binding of the two FTS formulations in the tissue samples taken from the animals, providing an additional detailed measure of the FTS distribution and localization patterns.\n\nResults from the Study will enhance any future communications between Lexaria and prospective industry partners. Study work has already begun with completion and final reporting expected in May, 2025.\n\n**About Lexaria Bioscience Corp. & DehydraTECH**\n\nDehydraTECH™ is Lexaria’s patented drug delivery formulation and processing platform technology which improves the way active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) enter the bloodstream through oral delivery.

The weight loss was maximized nine days after dosing and\nmaintained throughout the 8-week study duration. This apparent trend demonstrated roughly a 7% loss\nof body weight throughout the course of treatment at both DehydraTECH-CBD doses studied (30 mg/Kg\nand 100 mg/Kg). Only the DehydraTECH-CBD-dosed animals weighed less at the end of the study than\nat the beginning, whereas the weight of the untreated obese animals trended upwards throughout the\nstudy.\n40\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nAnimal Study DIAB-A22-1 Results\nIncrease in locomotor activity: Activity levels, which were measured in this study via locomotor activity,\nthe distance the animals travelled in open field observations. Interestingly, the lower dose of\nDehydraTECH-CBD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in locomotor activity compared to\nthe untreated obese control rats (*p<0.05), whereas there was no significant difference accordingly\nevidenced at the higher dose.\n41\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nAnimal Study DIAB-A22-1 Results\nLowered triglyceride levels: The animals dosed with DehydraTECH-CBD showed statistically significant\nreductions in triglyceride levels from day 35 onwards compared to the obese animals not dosed with\nDehydraTECH-CBD.\n42\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nAnimal Study DIAB-A22-1 Results\nLowered blood urea nitrogen levels: Kidney function was also evaluated compared to the vehicle control\nanimals by examination of the levels of blood urea nitrogen (\"BUN\"), creatinine, and assessment of the\nBUN/creatinine ratio. BUN levels were reduced by 27.9% +/- 5% (***p<0.001) in the obese animals\nreceiving DehydraTECH-CBD. Creatinine levels were also improved with a 16.8% +/-7% increase in the\nobese animals receiving DehydraTECH-CBD, although this improvement was not statistically significant.\nThe calculated BUN/creatinine ratio in the obese animals being treated with DehydraTECH-CBD\nreturned to a healthy range nearly equal to that of the lean animals, with a 55.1% +/-16% reduction\n(*p<0.05)\n43\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nDehydraTECH Oral CBD Human Clinical Study\n60\n• 2018 European human clinical study\nDehydraTECH formulation with process improvements\n(n=12)\n)\n1 - 50 Competitor - PTL101 - 100 mg\n• Double-blind, 90 mg CBD dose of L\nm\nDehydraTECH (“TurboCBD”) g\nn\n(\nn\no40\n• Higher CBD delivery throughout entire i\nt\na\nr\nstudy t\nn\ne\nc\nn\n30\no\n• Higher cerebral perfusion shown vs. c\na\nm\nbaseline (p < 0.001 )\ns\na\nl\nP\n20\n• Lower blood pressure (“BP”) shown vs.\nbaseline (p < 0.05)\n10\n0\nBL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nTime (hours)\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW 44\nLexaria’s Advanced Hypertension Program Results\nLexaria’s Advanced Hypertension Program Delivers Results with No Serious Adverse Effects:\n• 2018 - 12 person PK HCS evidenced 317% more CBD delivered to blood at 30-minutes\n• 2021 - HYPER-H21-1: 24 person HCS evidenced rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure\n• 2021 - HYPER-H21-2: 16 person HCS evidenced up to a 23% average reduction in overnight blood pressure and\nreduced arterial stiffness\n• 2021 - HYPER-H21-3: 16 person HCS reduced attenuated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (\"PASP”) by ~5 mmHg\nor 41% overall in male participants\n• 2022 - HYPER-H21-4: 66 person HCS evidenced:\n• Exceptional safety and tolerability, statistically significant lowering of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure\n(\"BP\"), BP lowered for the entire 5-week study duration and BP lowered both for patients currently taking\nother antihypertensive drugs as well as patients not taking any other antihypertensive drugs\n45\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nDehydraTECH-CBD Hypertension Program\nLexaria Issues Successful Results from First 2021 Study, HYPER-A21-1\n- (May 6, 2021)\n• Up to 2,178% more CBD delivered into bloodstream IDceosncription automatically generated with low confidence\n• Up to 1,737% more CBD delivered into brain tissue\nLexaria’s Newest DehydraTECH 2.0 Formulation Tested in Study HYPER-A21-2 Demonstrates Its\nStrongest CBD Absorption Results Ever - (May 20, 2021) IDceosncription automatically generated with low confidence\n• New formulation delivers up to 2,708% more CBD into bloodstream\nLexaria’s DehydraTECH-CBD Lowers Blood Pressure\n- (July 29, 2021)\nIDceosncription automatically generated with low confidence\n• Human Clinical Study HYPER-H21-1 evidences a rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure with\nDehydraTECH-CBD and excellent tolerability\nLexaria's Human Clinical Study Delivers Effective and Safe Blood Pressure Reduction Results over\n24-hour Ambulatory Period\n- (September 7, 2021)\nIDceosncription automatically generated with low confidence\n• Human Clinical Study HYPER-H21-2 evidences up to a remarkable 23% decrease in blood pressure with\npatented DehydraTECH-CBD relative to placebo\n46\nNASDAQ:LEXX | NASDAQ:LEXXW\nOther Examples of AUC Improvements from Non-Registration Enabling Studies\n• Antiviral Therapies – DehydraTECH-enabled remdesivir and ebastine delivered 82% and 204% more drug\ninto the bloodstream and a 167% improvement in drug delivery was demonstrated utilizing\nDehydraTECH-enabled colchicine in rats.\n• PDE5 Inhibitors – DehydraTECH-processed sildenafil in rats demonstrated a 37% drug delivery\nimprovement.\n• Human Hormones – DehydraTECH-estradiol achieved total drug delivery levels that were 1,500% greater\nthan the control for estradiol in rats and over 12,500% greater for estrone.\n• Reduced Risk Oral Nicotine – DehydraTECH-processed nicotine benzoate delivered 169% more nicotine\ninto the bloodstream in rats.
