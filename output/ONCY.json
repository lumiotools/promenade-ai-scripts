(NASDAQ: [ONCY](#financial-modal)) (TSX: ONC), a leading clinical-stage company specializing in immunotherapy for oncology, today announced third quarter financial results and operational highlights.\n\nWayne Pisano, Chair of Oncolytics’ Board of Directors and Interim CEO, stated, “With positive BRACELET-1 results, we have two randomized phase two studies confirming pelareorep’s potential in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. After discussions with regulators and key opinion leaders and based on an estimated overall survival benefit of more than a year provided by pelareorep-based therapy, a registration-enabling study that is designed to support an accelerated approval is the next logical step for the development of pelareorep.” Pisano continued, “We continue to develop our gastrointestinal cancer program and look forward to presenting updated efficacy data from our anal cancer cohort and safety data from our new modified FOLFIRNOX pancreatic cancer cohort. Both of these indications represent a significant unmet medical need, and we have shown pelareorep provides the potential to meaningfully improve patient outcomes. This coming year will be critical for pelareorep, as well as for Oncolytics, and I’ve never been more confident in the potential pelareorep can deliver to cancer patients in need.”\n\n**_Third Quarter Highlights_**\n\n**_BRACELET-1 data exceeds expectations,_** providing clear evidence of pelareorep’s ability to improve outcomes in patients with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer ([link to press release](https://oncolyticsbiotech.com/press_releases/oncolytics-biotech-reports-favorable-results-for-bracelet-1-breast-cancer-study-reinforcing-path-to-funding-of-a-registration-enabling-study/)), demonstrating progression-free survival of 12.1 months for pelareorep + paclitaxel compared to 6.4 months for paclitaxel alone, yielding a benefit of 5.7 months. Additionally, 64% of patients treated with pelareorep + paclitaxel lived at least two years compared to only 33% of patients treated with paclitaxel alone. Overall survival could not be calculated as more than half of the pelareorep + paclitaxel patients were alive at the end of the study. Assuming the remaining patients survived only until their next planned follow-up visit, the median overall survival would have been 32.1 months, which compares favorably to the 18.2 months recorded for patients who received paclitaxel monotherapy.\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported $19.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has a projected cash runway through key milestones and into 2025.\n  * The net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.5 million, compared to a net loss of $9.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The basic and diluted loss per share was $0.12 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.14 in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million, compared to $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses and clinical trial expenses. \n  * General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.1 million, compared with $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower investor relations activities and transaction costs as part of our public offering in 2023.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $19.1 million, compared to $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected non-cash working capital changes, partly offset by higher net operating activities in 2024.\n\n\n\n**Recent and Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * H1 2025: Finalize master protocol for the adaptive registration-enabling trial for pelareorep, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, and atezolizumab in first-line pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (GCAR) and submit it to the FDA\n  * H1 2025: Safety run-in data from cohort 5 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and modified FOLFIRNOX (mFOLFIRINOX) with or without atezolizumab in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer\n  * H1 2025: updated efficacy data from cohort 4 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and atezolizumab in second-line or later anal cancer\n  * Mid 2025: First patient enrolled in registration-enabling study evaluating pelareorep and paclitaxel in metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer\n  * H2 2025: Initial efficacy results from cohort 5 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and mFOLFIRINOX with or without atezolizumab in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer\n\n\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call for analysts and investors at 8:30 a.m. ET today, November 12, 2024.

biotechnology company developing pelareorep, an intravenously delivered immunotherapeutic agent. Pelareorep has demonstrated promising results in two randomized Phase 2 studies in metastatic breast cancer and Phase 1 and 2 studies in pancreatic cancer. It acts by inducing anti-cancer immune responses and promotes an inflamed tumor phenotype — turning “cold” tumors “hot” — through innate and adaptive immune responses to treat a variety of cancers.\n\nPelareorep has demonstrated synergies with multiple approved oncology treatments. Oncolytics is currently conducting and planning combination clinical trials with pelareorep in solid malignancies as it advances towards registrational studies in metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, both of which have received Fast Track designation from the FDA.

(NASDAQ: [ONCY](#financial-modal)) (TSX: ONC), a leading clinical-stage company specializing in immunotherapy for oncology, is issuing a corporate update to provide investors with a deeper understanding of recent data and what is expected for 2025. \n\n“We’re excited by the recent BRACELET-1 results, which exceeded our expectations and substantiate the strong efficacy signal previously observed in breast cancer patients treated with pelareorep,” said Wayne Pisano, Interim CEO and Chair of Oncolytics’ Board of Directors. “Having treated well over 100 HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer patients in multiple clinical studies, these results provide the basis for a development path leading to an accelerated approval. The BRACELET-1 results, combined with recent feedback from the FDA, give us confidence in our development approach, and we look forward to initiating a clinical trial designed to support the approval of pelareorep as a novel breast cancer therapeutic.”\n\nMr. Pisano continued, “The gastrointestinal cancer data also supports making pancreatic cancer a major priority for the company. To advance this development, we’ve established a collaboration with the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (GCAR), and The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) has provided us with the funding to further investigate pelareorep in pancreatic cancer through our GOBLET study. Having demonstrated pelareorep’s efficacy across multiple cancer indications and with important data readouts and future studies on the horizon, I’m looking forward to these next few years of Oncolytics’ growth and development.” \n\n**Planned HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer study could open the door to an accelerated approval**\n\nThe strong efficacy results from BRACELET-1 provide the foundation for a large Phase 2 study designed to support an accelerated approval. Early in 2025, we plan to submit to the FDA a pelareorep + paclitaxel combination therapy breast cancer trial. The study will enroll approximately 180 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like Enhertu, who are not eligible for ADCs, or who cannot tolerate ADCs, which represents a patient population of approximately 55,000 patients in the US.1-4 The study design has sufficient statistical power to deliver a p-value of < 0.05 with a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of ≥4.3 months. Notably, the BRACELET-1 study demonstrated a 5.7-month PFS benefit for the pelareorep + paclitaxel arm compared to chemotherapy alone, as detailed below. Enrollment in the registration-enabling study is expected to commence in the first half of 2025. \n\nThomas Heineman, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Oncolytics, commented, “With the continuing evolution of breast cancer treatment, we have designed our breast cancer program with the guidance of leading experts in the field. Our first randomized study in breast cancer, IND-213, demonstrated the ability of pelareorep combination therapy to improve survival in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- disease. The subsequent randomized BRACELET-1 study showed that pelareorep combination therapy could improve outcomes in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients who had received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Based on the success of these studies, we are now ready to pursue a large phase 2 study powered to support an accelerated approval in the setting of ADC therapies such as Enhertu. Our plan is designed to obtain a regulatory approval with fewer patients, in a shorter time, and requiring less funding than traditional regulatory pathways. Our thorough understanding of pelareorep’s mechanism of action makes us confident that pelareorep-based combination therapy will continue to deliver strong clinical benefits to HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients within the current treatment approach.”\n\n**BRACELET-1 efficacy data in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer**\n\nThe recently reported final BRACELET-1 study results provide clear evidence of pelareorep’s ability to improve outcomes in patients with advanced breast cancer ([link to press release](https://oncolyticsbiotech.com/press_releases/oncolytics-biotech-reports-favorable-results-for-bracelet-1-breast-cancer-study-reinforcing-path-to-funding-of-a-registration-enabling-study/)). Patients in the paclitaxel control arm had a median overall survival of 18.2 months. However, more than half of the patients in the pelareorep combination therapy arm were still alive at the time of the final survival analysis, resulting in a median overall survival of “Not Reached.” A conservative estimate of median overall survival for the pelareorep arm is 32.1 months, demonstrating that pelareorep + paclitaxel delivered a greater than 12-month survival advantage compared to paclitaxel alone. This survival benefit is further illustrated by the 24-month overall survival rate, which showed that 64% of patients treated with pelareorep combination therapy survived at least 2 years compared to only 33% of patients treated with paclitaxel alone. In addition, final progression-free survival was 12.1 months for pelareorep + paclitaxel compared to 6.4 months for paclitaxel alone, yielding a benefit of 5.7 months. \n\n**Gastrointestinal cancer opportunities**\n\nWe also anticipate continuing our development of pelareorep in gastrointestinal cancers. Once the master protocol has been finalized with GCAR for the pelareorep combination therapy, we intend to approach the FDA before the end of the year. This study is designed to produce registrational data. Additionally, we continue to evaluate pelareorep combination therapy in patients with anal cancer, building on the promising initial efficacy data in this patient population. If the expanded results continue to show a favorable efficacy signal, we anticipate moving directly to a registration-enabling study. Finally, we expect to provide updates on cohort 5 of the GOBLET study, which is investigating pelareorep in pancreatic cancer in combination with the chemotherapy modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) with or without atezolizumab. Positive results from this combination will bolster our opportunity in pancreatic cancer and potentially provide an additional registrational opportunity. The initial efficacy results from this cohort are expected in the second half of 2025.\n\n**Anticipated upcoming milestones**\n\n  * H1 2025: Initiate registrational study of pelareorep + paclitaxel in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer\n  * H1 2025: Safety run-in data from cohort 5 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and mFOLFIRINOX with or without atezolizumab in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer\n  * H1 2025: updated efficacy data from cohort 4 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and atezolizumab in second-line or later anal cancer\n  * H2 2025: Initial efficacy results from cohort 5 of the GOBLET study, investigating pelareorep and mFOLFIRINOX with or without atezolizumab in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n  1.
