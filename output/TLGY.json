The units are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and trade under the ticker symbol “TLGYU\". Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant and a contingent right to receive at least one-fourth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Company expects that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbols \"TLGY\" and “TLGYW”, respectively. \n\nTLGY is a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While the Company may pursue an acquisition or business combination target in any business or industry, it intends to focus its search on the global biopharma or technology enabled business-to-consumer (“B2C”) industries. \n\nTLGY is led by Jin-Goon Kim, a former partner of TPG Capital and a former CEO of industry leaders in Asia, including Dell Korea and Li Ning. Jin-Goon Kim is joined by Co-Presidents, Dr. Theron Odlaug, who has more than 40 years of experience as a CEO, Board Member and Senior Executive of pharmaceutical and allied companies, and Steven Norman, who has more than 20 years of experience as an executive and a director in the Asia-Pacific technology space. \n\nMizuho Securities acted as the sole bookrunner for the offering, and Baird acted as lead manager for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any. \n\nRegistration statements relating to these securities have been filed with, and declared effective by, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. \n\nThe public offering was made only by means of a prospectus.
