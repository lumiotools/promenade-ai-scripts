The company will host an investor call on Tuesday, August 15th, 2023 at 4:00 PM ET.\n\n**Investor Earnings Call Details**\n\nDate/Time: Tuesday, August 15th, 2023 at 4:00 PM ET\n\nDial-in Number: 1-833-630-0019 (domestic) or 1-412-317-1807 (international)\n\nOnline Replay/Transcript: Audio file and call transcript will be posted to AmpliTech's [**news page**](https://www.amplitechinc.com/news) when available.\n\nInvestor Questions: May be submitted to **investors@amplitechgroup.com** prior to or during the call\n\n**Second Quarter 2023 Highlights**\n\n  * Q2 2023 revenue was $4.1 million compared to $4.6 million in Q2 2022.\n  * Gross profit of $1.9 million compared to $2.0 million in Q2 2022 despite lower international sales from the semiconductor materials division.\n  * Gross profit margin reached a record 47.2% compared to 44.5% in Q2 2022, an increase of 270 basis points despite inflationary pressures.\n  * Core LNA revenue grew 23% to $1.8 million from $1.4 million in Q2 2022.\n  * Spectrum sales were $2.3 million, a year-over-year decline of 27%, primarily due to lower international sales and softer semiconductor industry-wide demand.\n  * Loss from operations was $508,110 primarily due to the Company's ongoing investments in new product development, including new 5G and wireless infrastructure products and MMIC designs as well as a wide-ranging automated CRM system.\n  * At June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and liquid marketable securities totaled $9.3 million, ample capital to execute the Company's strategic growth initiatives.\n  * AmpliTech expects continued growth in demand for its core LNA and semiconductor products as it works through its $66M CRM opportunity funnel.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nFawad Maqbool, CEO of AmpliTech, said, \"In the second quarter our core LNA business remained strong offset by weaker semiconductor sales, especially internationally. Gross profit was modestly lower, while the gross profit margin reached a record level. We have continued to invest for future growth and are excited to share that our ongoing R&D projects centered around our 5G ORAN massive MIMO radio units are progressing well and are on track with our expectations.\n\n\"Through the utilization of Massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas coupled with beam forming technology, we are enabling a precise and efficient allocation of spectrum resources. This breakthrough approach is addressing existing performance limitations, facilitating support for a larger user base within each cell, and enhancing the overall end-user experience in densely populated regions.\n\n\"Our cutting-edge 5G ORAN radios are also set to showcase our proprietary LNA 5G MMIC chips. This technology, characterized by an exceptionally low noise figure, will help differentiate our products from competitors, as it will enable an increased coverage range. As a result, this innovation reduces the requisite number of radios in a 5G network, leading to an opportunity to enhance the return on investment for every deployment site. We anticipate the receipt of initial prototype units by our AGTGSS division in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\"The robust investments made by AmpliTech in these new technology endeavors are paving the way for the introduction of novel product solutions with inherently higher gross margins that should in turn yield higher net income. We believe that these solutions are poised to elevate the company to new heights when they are introduced and available to the market, which we expect will be in 2024,\" concluded Mr. Maqbool.\n\n**About AmpliTech Group**\n\nAmpliTech Group, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes state-of-the-art radio frequency (RF) microwave components for global satellite communications, telecom (5G & IoT), space, defense, and quantum computing markets as well as systems and component design consulting services.

Ideal for AR and VR\nApplications\nLow Latency:\n➢ Our Radio Units reduced latency experienced\nby the end users in 5G networks from\nhundredths of seconds to a few of\nmilliseconds can have an unexpected impact,\nleading to a real digital revolution.\n34\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nNasdaq: AMPG\nArea of Coverage:\nIn the fifth-generation (5G) mobile\ncommunication system, the outdoor-to-\nindoor (O2I) coverage in urban areas is an\nimportant scenario for the network\ndeployment. The base stations on building\nrooftops or towers provide O2I coverage\nfor nearby buildings.\n35\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nNumber of Users:\nNasdaq: AMPG\n➢\nThe maximum number of 5G cell depends\non the specific configuration of the cell and\nthe type of 5G technology being used. 5G\nnetworks can support up to 1,000 users per\ncell, with some configurations supporting up\nto 10,000 users.\n➢ With our LNAs, Low Noise figure not only\nincrease the covering area but massive users\naccommodations are also increased.\n➢ Additionally, Massive MIMO in our Radio\nUnits also increase the number of users\nwithin each 5G cell.\n36\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nPhysical Blocking Signal Solutions:\nNasdaq: AMPG\n➢ Existing 5 GHz networks do not penetrate\nsolid objects such as walls nearly as well as\ndo 2.4 GHz signals. This can limit the access\npoints reach inside buildings, like homes and\noffices, where many walls may come between\na 5G antenna and the user.\n➢ AMPG RUs, will steer the beams from the\nobstacle and create direct line of sight (LOS)\nin the intended area.\n37\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nPublic to Private Handover:\nNasdaq: AMPG\n➢ AMPG radios provide accessibility of\nhandovering of data networks from\nPublic 5G network to Non-public\n(Private) network and vice versa.\nSoftware Upgrades without Changing Hardware\n➢ Software based upgrades, also known as,\nZero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) automates\n4G to 5G upgrade projects by removing the\nrequirement for multiple truck rolls and highly\nskilled field staff to cell sites to reduce\ndeployment workloads, schedules, and costs.\n38\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nSupport Previous Generations:\nNasdaq: AMPG\n➢ 5G networks not only operate individually\n(SA) but also support previous generations\nlike 4G/LTE(NSA) and our radio units are\ncapable enough to support both of them.\nSecurity:\n➢ Our Radio Units provide greater security\nmobile network which can be deployed at\none or more of the enterprise’s sites.\nTherefore, security risks or threats are\nreduced, and data is processed on-site\nadding another layer of security to\ncommunications.\n39\nInvestor Presentation September2023\nTracking:\nNasdaq: AMPG\n➢ The knowledge of which cell tower or\nantenna a mobile user communicates with\ncan reveal valuable information about the\nuser’s location.\n➢ Each time a user connects to a 5G antenna,\nmobile networks can pinpoint a user's location\nand can even determine what building, road\nor even car a user is in.\n40\nInvestor Presentation September2023"
