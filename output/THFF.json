Because such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially\nfrom those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s\nexpectations include competition from other financial institutions and financial holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and\nfiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans, fluctuations in value of\ncollateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing or saving habits; and\nacquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables.
