(Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com),\nLatin America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nNet revenues & financial income of $5.3 billion, up 35% YoY and 103% FX-neutral\nIncome from operations of $557 million, with a 10.5% margin\nNet income of $397 million, with a 7.5% margin\n$50.7 billion Total Payment Volume, up 34% YoY and 73% FX-neutral\n$12.9 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 14% YoY and 71% FX-neutral\nTo our Shareholders\nWe are pleased to report another quarter of growth in Q3'24. Momentum is strong across the business, with\nsolid growth in unique buyers, Fintech monthly active users (MAU), GMV, the credit portfolio and acquiring\nTPV in all major geographies. We believe we are making excellent progress on our long-term strategic goals\nof increasing the penetration of online commerce in Latin America, becoming the principal financial services\nprovider to users of Mercado Pago and scaling our acquiring business. Our competitive position is\nstrengthening as retention improves across our businesses. This gives us great confidence as we invest to\nfully capitalize on the many growth opportunities that are ahead of us, knowing that our ecosystem is uniquely\nplaced to capture those opportunities.\nCommerce\nWe are excited about the prospect of driving offline retail online in Latin America, where ecommerce\npenetration lags the USA by almost a decade. We see a huge runway for growth. We executed well on this\nopportunity in Q3'24, with very strong FX-neutral GMV growth of 34% YoY in Brazil and 27% YoY in Mexico. In\nArgentina, items sold grew by an impressive 16% YoY as consumption trends continued to improve. Market\nshare grew in all major geographies. Unique buyers across the region reached almost 61mn, rising 21% YoY.\nThis is the second quarter in succession that unique buyer growth has accelerated to a new post-pandemic\nhigh. This performance reinforces our conviction in the investments we are making to capture the long-term,\nstructural growth opportunities ahead of us.\nOffline to online is a secular trend, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum; it is fueled by innovation and investment\nto constantly improve the online buying experience. Initiatives in Q3'24 included the launch of installation\nappointments for autoparts, bulk purchase discounts in apparel, virtual try-on for makeup and dynamic pricing\ntools for sellers. Despite being the leading ecommerce platform with 25 years of history in the region, we still\nsee plenty of scope to expand our user base given the population of more than 650mn in Latin America.\nIn Q3’24 we split our loyalty scheme, MELI+, into two tiers called “MELI+ Essencial” and “MELI+ Total”. \"Meli+\nEssencial\", at just below $2 per month, provides users with a unique package of ecosystemic benefits\nincluding a lower threshold for free shipping, extra installments on purchases in Mercado Libre and cashback\non purchases on and off Mercado Libre. The “MELI+ Total”, at roughly $5 per month, includes all these\necosystemic benefits plus access to content from Disney+ and Deezer, and discounts on other streaming\nservices. With these changes, we are extending the reach of our loyalty scheme providing more value to\nusers.\n2\nQ3’24 Results\nOur logistics network is a powerful tool to drive offline retail online by providing a better user experience for\nboth buyers and sellers. Fulfillment leads to higher GMV growth because of faster delivery promises, higher\nconversion and stronger buyer and seller NPS. This is a self-reinforcing process that repeats as we increase\nfulfillment. This is the reason why we continue investing in expanding our logistics infrastructure to increase\nthe penetration of fulfillment in Brazil and to keep up with the strong pace of growth in our Commerce\noperation in Mexico. As such, we opened five fulfillment centers in Brazil in Q3'24, plus one in Mexico.\nAlthough new facilities can create short-term margin pressure, they are critical to our long-term growth, scale\nand cost dilution.\n1P GMV surpassed last year's peak quarter (Q4'23) due to growth of 62% YoY in Q3'24. Our strategy of\nexpanding our product assortment at competitive prices where there are gaps in our 3P selection is\nsucceeding. We introduced presale functionality for the iPhone 16 launch, for which we had a full assortment\nand competitive prices. We also had exclusivity for the launch of the Motorola G85, an accessible smartphone\nwith a premium design. These examples show how 1P is turning MELI into a destination for categories in which\nwe have historically had less presence in. As we scale 1P, we continue to see improvements in its profitability.\nAs such, 1P did not act as a drag on the YoY evolution of our income from operations margin Q3'24.\nAdvertising is a strong profit driver for Mercado Libre, with significant potential for growth as the digital Retail\nMedia trend gathers steam and first-party data becomes increasingly important. We also see growth\nopportunities as we build our presence in advertising formats beyond Product Ads, which currently accounts\nfor most of our revenue. Advertising revenue grew 37% YoY in Q3'24, well ahead of GMV, reaching a\npenetration of 2.0% of GMV, up 30 bps YoY.\nFintech Services\nWe have great momentum in Fintech Services as more users choose Mercado Pago as their financial services\npartner. MAU rose 35% YoY to 56mn in Q3'24. Engagement is rising, with \"power users\" (those transacting in\nnine out of the last twelve weeks) growing at a much faster rate, and transactions and products per MAU also\nrising. The expansion of our credit offer, particularly the Mercado Pago credit card, and rising awareness of\nour remunerated account are driving this performance, as well as NPS gains.\nThe credit card had another good quarter in Q3'24, with the portfolio of $2.3bn growing strongly by 172% YoY\nand 28% QoQ. We are scaling the credit card at pace because our scoring models are increasingly accurate\nand our older cohorts are showing a good path towards profitability (with solid NIMAL spreads), with some of\nthem already being profitable. In Q3’24 we invested $76mn in scaling our credit card portfolio. Despite short-\nterm margin pressure, these investments are strategically important because the credit card drives the\nadoption of Mercado Pago as a principal account and brings positive ecosystemic behavior.\nThe total credit portfolio grew at its fastest pace since Q1'22, rising 77% YoY to $6.0bn. Growth was strong\nacross products and geographies. The consumer book grew 37% YoY, helped by successfully extending\nlarger, longer duration loans to lower risk users in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The portfolio in Argentina\nreached record levels and delivered solid profitability. We also surpassed the milestone of $1bn in merchant\nloans across the region for the first time. Our consumer and merchant loans are a solid source of profitability\nthat more than offset the investments in our credit card.\nThe NIMAL spread of 24% fell 13ppts YoY, despite solid asset quality indicators with broadly stable roll rates\nand the 15-90 day NPL of 7.8%. There were three reasons behind the reduction in NIMAL: the ramp up of the\ncredit card, the move upmarket in consumer and merchant credit, and the overall acceleration of our credit\noriginations in the quarter.\nAs we scale the credit card, its share in the total portfolio rose from 25% in Q3'23 to 39% in Q3'24. This\ncreated a negative mix effect on NIMAL, because the credit card is a structurally lower spread product. The\nsecond reason for the NIMAL decline was our strategic decision to continue moving upmarket with our credit\noffering to lower risk users with lower spreads. This is incremental to portfolio dollars and has a positive\nimpact on NPS. Finally, we accelerated our origination across products in this quarter and, given that we\nprovision our expected losses up front, this resulted in higher bad debt in this quarter.\n2\nQ3’24 Results\nTrends in fintech services more broadly are encouraging. Assets under management (AUM) had another\noutstanding quarter, growing 93% YoY to $8.0bn. A large part of this is our remunerated account, which is\ncore to our value proposition as an entry point for wider engagement with Mercado Pago. Marketing\ncampaigns in Brazil and Mexico have led to a positive cycle of greater awareness, more users and higher\nbalances, all of which drive higher NPS. This, in turn, brings more users to our platform. We have seen this\nwork fantastically well in Argentina in recent years and more recently in Mexico, where funds invested in our\nremunerated account increased 345% YoY. Insurtech is scaling well (revenues growing 36% YoY), with great\ncross-selling around the ecosystem. For example, we launched a credit card insurance product in Q3'24 that\nhelps to accelerate the payback on the investment we are making in the credit card.\nAcquiring\nAcquiring performed well in Q3'24 as we scale the business across the region. Acquiring TPV grew 30% YoY\nin Brazil on an FX-neutral basis, with the POS business accelerating. We see plenty of growth potential in\nBrazil, our largest acquiring market. A differentiated offer is key to fully capitalizing on this opportunity. We\nlaunched software for merchants that use our POS devices in Q3’24 as a new front in this strategy. Initially, the\npackage enables merchants to create a product catalog, issue tax receipts and manage inventory. Over time,\nwe intend to layer on additional capabilities. The software is fully integrated with our ecosystem, so merchants\nthat sell on our marketplace can automatically download their product catalog to their Mercado Pago POS. We\nalso continue to cross-sell our fintech services, including credit, as another important differentiator and a\nsource of monetization.\nIn Argentina, acquiring TPV growth picked up in real terms (discounting inflation). This shows the strength of\nthe Mercado Pago brand, its role as a disruptive force in payments in Argentina and the improvement in wider\nconsumption trends. Acquiring TPV growth was solid in Mexico at 46% YoY (FX-neutral) with in-store\npayments growing at more than 100% YoY. We have a huge opportunity in Mexico to lead the transition to\ndigital payments.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nNet revenue and financial income reached $5,312mn in Q3'24, growing 35% YoY despite FX headwinds in all\nthree major geographies. The shipping reporting updates outlined in our Q1'24 Shareholder Letter contributed\n13ppts ($513mn) to growth. Net revenue grew strongly in Brazil and Mexico, with both delivering FX-neutral\ngrowth of 60% YoY. In Argentina, FX-neutral revenue grew 245% YoY, ahead of inflation and at a slightly\nfaster pace of real growth when compared to Q2'24. Both Commerce and Fintech revenue streams are\ngrowing well, up 48% YoY (of which 24ppts relates to shipping reporting updates) and 21% YoY respectively,\ndespite FX headwinds.\nQ3'24 income from operations reached $557mn, with a margin of 10.5% and a reduction of 9.5ppts YoY on a\nreported basis. Approximately 2ppts of the YoY margin decline relates to the dilutive impact of the shipping\nreporting updates outlined in Q1'24, and the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina following the\nreclassification of Mercado Pago interest income and expense above EBIT (also in Q1'24). Excluding these two\neffects, the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts on a comparable basis.\nMost of this 7.4ppts margin compression is due to strategic investment decisions that we made in the quarter,\nwhich included:\n1. The investment in our credit business, which increases our upfront provisions and generates the\nlargest single contributor (3.4ppts) to the YoY margin decline. As we explained before, we accelerated\norigination across all of our credit products (portfolio +77% YoY) and there was also a shift in the credit\nmix towards the credit card, which increased its share in the credit portfolio from 25% in Q3'23 to 39%\nin Q3'24.\n2. The investment in shipping, whose effect on margins is partially diluted by higher GMV and intense\nwork to improve productivity. The overall cost impact on our consolidated income from operations\nmargin from investments in logistics in Q3'24 was 0.8ppts YoY (as per the gross margin bridge in our\nearnings presentation).\n3\nQ3’24 Results\nIn addition to these effects, the accruals for variable compensation under the Long Term Retention Plan (LTRP)\nincreased 0.7ppts as a result of a larger share price increase in Q3'24 vs. Q3'23. G&A expenses rose 1.1ppts\nYoY, of which 0.8ppts were due to a non recurring expense that relates to certain customer refunds for prior\nperiods. The remaining margin pressures come from business-as-usual cost volatility.\nIncome from Operations Margin\n-950 bps\n-740 bps\ncomparable\n20.0%\n18.2%\n0.2%\n(1.8)%\n(2.2)% (0.3)% (1.1)% (0.7)% 10.8% 0.7% 10.5%\n(3.4)% (1.0)%\nEBIT Mercado Pago EBIT COGS Marketing G&A Product LTRP Bad Debt EBIT Margin Mercado Update to EBIT\nMargin Interest Margin Expenses Development Q3'24 Pago Shipping Margin\nQ3'23 Income & Q3'23 As & Sales Comparable Interest T&C Q3'24\nRecast Expense Reported Expenses Income & Reported\nReclassificationLast Year Expense\nAs Reported in 10-Q Q3’24 comparable with\nQ3’23 as reported in 2023\nThe 7.4 ppts margin compression described above, includes the net impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian\nReal and the Mexican Peso during Q3´24\nAs we mentioned in previous quarters, the Net Income result adjusts for the FX distortions we have seen in\nArgentina during 2023. In Q3'24 Net income rose 11% YoY to $397mn resulting in a Net Income margin of\n7.5%. Lower EBIT was partially offset by a significant reduction in FX losses related to Argentina and lower\nincome taxes. As a consequence, even though the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts compared to last year,\nNet Income Margin only compressed by 1.1ppt as described in the chart below:\nNet Income Margin\n-160 bps\n-110 bps\ncomparable\n9.1% 0.4% 9.5%\n2.0% 8.4%\n7.5%\n5.5%\n(0.2)%\n(2.2)% (0.7)%\n1.2%\n(5.2)%\n(2.4)%\nNet Mercado Pago Net COGS OPEX Interest Financial Foreign Income Net Income Mercado Update to Net\nIncome Interest Income Income Expenses Exchange Tax Margin Pago Shipping Income\nMargin Income & Margin (excl.

Year to date, we have generated more than $635mn of adjusted free cash flow. Our robust\nfinancial flexibility, conservative capital structure and positive long-term fundamentals, led to Fitch upgrading its\ncredit rating on Mercado Libre to Investment Grade in October (BBB-).\nLooking Ahead\nMomentum is fantastic across Mercado Libre, and we are optimistic about the long runway of growth we see\nin commerce, advertising, fintech services and acquiring across our region. We are confident that our\ninvestments are unlocking these structural growth opportunities, and our Q3'24 results are evidence of that.\nWe are committed to investing with discipline to maximize the size of the business in the long-term in a\nsustainable, profitable and cash generative manner. We look ahead with excitement because the best is yet to\ncome.\n5\nQ3’24 Results\nThe following table summarizes certain key performance metrics for the nine and three-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n(IN MILLIONS, except %) (1) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nFintech monthly active users 56 42 56 42\nUnique active buyers 87 74 61 50\nGross merchandise volume $ 36,919 $ 31,299 $ 12,907 $ 11,360\nNumber of items sold 1,262 991 456 357\nNumber of items shipped 1,249 970 453 350\nTotal payment volume (2) $ 137,746 $ 102,278 $ 50,691 $ 37,839\nAcquiring total payment\n$ 100,367 $ 81,221 $ 36,042 $ 29,721\nvolume\nTotal payment transactions (2) 8,030 5,275 2,936 1,991\nNIMAL 28.3 % 35.1 % 24.2 % 37.4 %\nCapital expenditures $ 555 $ 329 $ 223 $ 126\nDepreciation and amortization $ 465 $ 389 $ 157 $ 135\n(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures can be found in the tables below.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of\naccounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-\nGAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the\nmost comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\nprovides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the\nfuture.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the\neffect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense\nand other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an\nunconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our\nManagement to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation\nof leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it\nprovides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain\nitems.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet income $ 397 $ 359\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 157 135\nInterest income and other financial gains (43) (38)\nInterest expense and other financial losses 40 53\nForeign currency losses, net 40 239\nIncome tax expense 123 172\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 714 $ 920\n14\nQ3’24 Results\nNet debt\nWe define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial\nliabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities\nrestricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have\nincluded this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current\nleverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance\nsheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to\ninvestors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its\ncapability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used\nmeasures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent Loans payable and other financial liabilities $ 2,250 $ 2,292\nNon-current Loans payable and other financial liabilities 3,103 2,203\nCurrent Operating lease liabilities 201 166\nNon-current Operating lease liabilities 770 672\nTotal debt 6,324 5,333\nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents 2,162 2,556\nShort-term investments (1) 1,109 1,191\nLong-term investments (2) 1,146 81\nNet debt $ 1,907 $ 1,505\n(1) Excludes time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee.\n(2) Excludes investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.\n15\nQ3’24 Results\nFX neutral\nWe believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by\nexcluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results\nand business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during\n2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have\nbeen had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany\nallocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local\ncurrency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local\ncurrency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the\nthree-month periods ended September 30, 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAs reported As recast (1) Percentage F MX e N ase uu rt era sl As recast (1) Percentage\nChange Change\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except percentages) (In millions, except percentages)\nNet revenues and\n$ 5,312 $ 3,927 35.3 % $ 7,961 $ 3,927 102.7 %\nfinancial income\nCost of net revenues\n(2,873) (1,832) 56.8 % (3,996) (1,832) 118.1 %\nand financial expenses\nGross profit 2,439 2,095 16.4 % 3,965 2,095 89.3 %\nOperating expenses (1,882) (1,310) 43.7 % (2,775) (1,310) 111.8 %\nIncome from\n$ 557 $ 785 (29.0) % $ 1,190 $ 785 51.6 %\noperations\n(1) Recast for consistency with the current presentation due to the change in the presentation of certain financial results.

We\nconsider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to\nmanagement and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that\ncan be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the\nutility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the\ntotal increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe\nit is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net\nproceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and\ncorporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not\nconsidered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides\nuseful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and\nactivities from the adjusted free cash flow.\n17\nQ3’24 Results\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash\nflow and Net increase in available cash and investments:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities (\"CFO\") $ 4,994 $ 3,212\nAdjustments to reconcile CFO to Adjusted free cash flow (1) 117 19\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds\ndue to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at (1,594) (464)\ncost\nInvestments in property and equipment and intangible assets (555) (329)\nChanges in loans receivable, net (3,316) (1,465)\nProceeds from loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech\n989 94\nsolutions, net\nAdjusted free cash flow 635 1,067\nProceeds from/Payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to\n214 (78)\nour Commerce and Corporate activities, net\nOther investing and/or financing activities 5 (405)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on available cash and investments (265) (85)\nNet increase in available cash and investments $ 589 $ 499\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the beginning of the year 3,828 3,275\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the end of the period 4,417 3,774\nNet cash used in investing activities (6,159) (2,536)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,202 (340)\n(1) Includes accrued interest and financial income net of interest received from available and restricted investments.\n(2) Includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted\nand held in guarantee) and long-term investments (excluding investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and\nequity securities held at cost).\n> CONTACT:\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor@mercadolibre.com\nhttp://investor.mercadolibre.com\n18"

(Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin\nAmerica’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30,\n2024.\nNet revenues & financial income of $5.1 billion, up 42% YoY and 113% FX-neutral\nIncome from operations of $726 million, with a 14.3% margin\nNet income of $531 million, with a 10.5% margin\n$46.3 billion Total Payment Volume, up 36% YoY and 86% FX-neutral\n$12.6 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 20% YoY and 83% FX-neutral\nTo our Shareholders\nWe delivered a great financial and operational performance in Q2'24, with growth in GMV, Acquiring TPV and\nthe Credits portfolio accelerating in all three major geographies on a YoY FX-neutral basis. Unique buyer\ngrowth also accelerated and Fintech MAU surpassed 50mn for the first time. Our ecosystem is gaining more\ntraction, and our investments in product, technology and service levels are extending our position as the\nregion's leading ecommerce and fintech platform.\nAt the same time, we are delivering strong financial results both at the top line - with Q2'24 revenue growth of\n42% YoY (of which 14ppts relates to the shipping reporting updates outlined in Q1'24) - and at the bottom line,\nwith net income rising 103% YoY to $531mn. Our net income margin reached 10.5% in Q2'24, up 3ppts YoY\nand at the highest level since Q1'17.\nCommerce\nFX-neutral GMV growth in Q2'24 was outstanding in Brazil where it accelerated to 36% YoY even on a high\nbase. Mexico was also strong, up 30% YoY, and initiatives to incentivize consumption in Argentina led to items\nsold returning to YoY growth. We are driving offline retail online by creating a superior experience for buyers\nand sellers, and this is the major source of our growth. Unique buyer growth of 19% YoY - the fastest pace\nsince Q2'21 - is testament to that. We believe that the continued expansion of our user base sets us up well for\nfuture growth as buyers purchase more items across more categories over time. We see this in the number of\nbuyers that purchase three or more categories per quarter - which reached record highs for a second quarter\nin Q2'24 - and in the growth of items purchased per buyer. This all contributed to items sold rising 29% YoY,\nthe highest growth since Q2'21. LatAm ecommerce penetration is still low relative to other regions and these\nfigures show Mercado Libre in a unique position to be a driving force of this structural growth opportunity.\nWe continue to raise the bar for buyers and sellers through investment, innovation and execution. In Q2'24,\nfulfillment penetration - which enables faster delivery for buyers and higher conversion for sellers - jumped\n8ppts YoY in Brazil, and free shipping rose 4ppts YoY for MELI as a whole. This was helped by MELI+, which\ncontinues to scale. Delivery speed promises reached record levels in Brazil and Colombia in Q2'24, and our\ndata shows we have the fastest delivery across major cities in the region, including São Paulo and Mexico City.\nTo enhance our cross-border value proposition, we opened a fulfillment center in Texas to offer inventory from\nUS sellers to buyers in Mexico. As we continue to innovate, we introduced immediate AI-generated answers to\nquestions in product pages, launched gift lists and included more personalization of incentives such as\ncoupons. We expanded our apparel and beauty assortment by onboarding hundreds of sellers from clothing\nmanufacturing hubs in Brazil, and by launching premium brands such as Hugo Boss in Brazil and Kerastase in\nBrazil and Mexico.\n2\nQ2’24 Results\nSellers are also investing more to complement our promotions and campaigns and to capitalize on Mercado\nLibre's growing audience and frequency. As a result, we had record levels of promotional coverage in Brazil in\nQ2'24 and in Mexico during the Hot Sale in May. Our social tools are gaining traction as they leverage the\nmarketplace's strong momentum and growing audience, with thousands of new partners joining our Affiliates\nprogram to promote products on their social media. The coverage of GMV with our short-format Clips videos is\nrising rapidly and the number of engaged viewers is almost 4x higher than a year ago.\nOur Ads business continues to scale, with revenue equivalent to 2.0% of GMV (+40bps YoY) and growing 51%\nYoY in Q2'24. The growing user base and frequency of our marketplace strengthens our Ads business as it\nenables advertisers to target larger audiences on an increasingly granular basis with our first-party data. The\ncore on-platform business continues to see strong momentum as a result of continuous improvements in our\nproduct, display and brand ads formats. We are also seeing encouraging early signs in video ads with monthly\nactive users of Mercado Play - our free streaming platform for third-party content - growing above 20% month-\non-month throughout Q2'24, less than 12 months after its launch as a startup within the company.\nIn early July, we started the development of our off-platform business with our first external partnership which\nserves programmatic video ads within the new ad-supported version of Disney+. This is the beginning of a\nvery exciting journey for Mercado Ads, with more external display and video partnerships to come.\nFintech Services\nThe influx of users into Mercado Pago shows its central position as a key player in financial services, with MAU\nup 37% YoY to 52mn in Q2'24. We are seeing higher levels of engagement in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico\nwith heavy users growing at a faster pace, the number of products per user rising consistently and higher\nlevels of retention in recent cohorts.\nOne of the pillars of our value proposition is the remunerated account, which pays interest as soon as funds\nare deposited with immediate liquidity. Its success has been clear in Argentina, with users tripling and USD\nAUM more than doubling in the last 18 months. We see similar signs of momentum in Brazil with millions of\nnew users attracted to our \"conta turbinada\", which offers the highest remuneration in the market. This helped\nBrazil MAU grow 46% YoY in Q2'24 and contributed to an 86% YoY rise in total MELI AUM to $6.6bn. With\nstrong results in Argentina and Brazil that show clear, positive downstream impacts from offering market-\nleading remuneration, we announced in early July that we would extend this strategy to Mexico with 15%\nannual account remuneration.\nWe see huge opportunities for Mercado Pago in Mexico. In June, we announced our intention to apply for a\nbanking license, which will enable us to scale the business to achieve our ambition of being the number one\ndigital bank in the country. Our ecosystem will be central to the strategy, and it has already proven to be a\nmajor contributor to Mercado Pago's early progress in Mexico as the largest Fintech in terms of MAUs with\nsolid NPS and a profitable credit portfolio that exceeded $1.5bn in Q2'24.\nCredit performed well across the region in Q2’24, with portfolio growth picking up again to 51% YoY, taking\nthe book to $4.9bn. The credit card continues to be the main contributor to growth on the back of 1.6mn new\ncards issued in Brazil and Mexico and upselling existing users to larger, more competitive credit lines in Brazil.\nThe fast pace of growth is grounded in robust and stable asset quality metrics and the rising accuracy of our\nunderwriting models. For the credit card, we are primarily targeting our large ecosystem audience where we\nhave an underwriting edge and seamless integration, which enhances the user experience. Credit card TPV\ngrowth (FX-neutral) accelerated to 208% YoY in Q2'24 with a majority of the volume originating off-platform,\nindicating progress on the path to principality. The encouraging performance of the credit card is strategically\nimportant as it is another key pillar of Mercado Pago's long-term value proposition. We continue to see strong\ndemand for our other loan products, with more than 6mn additional users in our Consumer portfolio YoY, and\na 1mn YoY increase in users in the Merchant portfolio.\n3\nQ2’24 Results\nNIMAL remains healthy for each of the consumer, merchant and credit card portfolios, but the consolidated\nNIMAL of 31.1% was down 5.7ppts YoY due to a mix shift towards the credit card. Spreads on the credit card\nare structurally lower than our other loan products, but it is complementary and incremental to our portfolio\nand strategically important since it leads to positive ecosystemic behavior such as more purchasing on the\nmarketplace and higher engagement with our Fintech platform. Furthermore, the 15-90 day NPL of 8.2% in\nQ2'24 was 110bps lower QoQ due to improvement in the consumer and credit card portfolios, highlighting that\nasset quality remains robust.\nInsurtech is scaling well with the number of active policies growing almost 100% YoY in Q2'24. We believe this\nis a fantastic product to cross-sell in our ecosystem. It is now easier for buyers to access extended warranties\nafter making them available to purchase as part of the shopping cart. This contributed to record performance\nin Q2 driven by the Hot Sale in Mexico and Argentina, with 2.6mn policies sold. NPS is on a positive trend, and\nrevenue contribution from off-marketplace insurance products - such as card and personal accident insurance\n- reached record highs in Q2'24.\nAcquiring\nAcquiring TPV reached almost $34bn in Q2'24, up 24% YoY or 75% on an FX-neutral basis with Argentina,\nBrazil and Mexico each showing faster growth than in Q1'24. The move upmarket to serve larger merchants in\nour POS business continues to bear fruit with TPV per device growing at a double-digit rate. This trend is\nstrongest in Mexico, where we have seen encouraging sales of our more sophisticated devices and the scale\nof off-platform TPV decoupling from marketplace TPV. We are also seeing promising results from the\nreorganization of our go-to-market channels in mid-2023 in Brazil, where we continue to see plenty of\npotential to grow in the SMB segment.\nOnline Payments continues to grow at high double-digit rates in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. It has benefited from\na more robust acquisition effort that leverages the more than two decades of experience that we have built\ninto our product. The growth in the proportion of logged payers - buyers on third party platforms that are able\nto pay via their Mercado Pago account - has helped to drive NPS higher across our major geographies. We\ncontinue to see an attractive structural growth opportunity across the region for Online Payments.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nOur revenue continued to scale well in Q2'24 and reached $5,073mn, growing 42% YoY. The shipping\nreporting updates we outlined in our Q1'24 Shareholder Letter contributed 14ppts ($484mn) to growth. We are\nseeing encouraging trends across our geographies with strong revenue growth of 51% YoY in Brazil (15ppts\nfrom shipping reporting updates), 66% YoY in Mexico (22ppts from shipping reporting updates) and 36% YoY\nin our Others segment (12ppts from shipping reporting updates). Argentina's FX-neutral growth of 285% YoY\n(flat YoY in USD) was similar to inflation, marking a significant improvement vs. Q1'24, primarily on the back of\nstronger GMV trends. Both Commerce and Fintech revenue streams are growing well, up 53% YoY (25ppts\nfrom shipping reporting updates) and 28% YoY respectively in USD despite FX headwinds. This underscores\nthat we are executing well on the growth opportunities we are exploring.\nIncome from operations of $726mn in Q2’24 was up 9% YoY, and grew 31% YoY ex. Argentina. The margin of\n14.3% fell 4.4ppts YoY, with headwinds of: a) 1.5ppts from the dilutive effect of the shipping reporting updates\nthat we outlined in Q1'24 (which impact our 2024 financials, but not the 2023 comparisons); b) 2.4ppts due to\nArgentina's margin contracting and its contribution to revenue diminishing; and c) 2.7ppts from provisions for\ndoubtful accounts.\nLogistics net costs rose by 50bps YoY as a percentage of GMV (equivalent to 130bps of revenue) due to\ninvestment in strategic initiatives such as fulfillment and MELI+, as well as higher short-term costs in Mexico.\nThat said, net costs as a percentage of GMV improved on a sequential basis helped by productivity gains in\nour fulfillment centers in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. We are also managing carrier costs tightly,\nand were able to postpone increases from certain suppliers to H2'24.\n4\nQ2’24 Results\nThe increase in provisions for doubtful accounts was due to two factors: 1) the faster pace of growth in credit\noriginations in Q2'24 (+79% YoY) versus consolidated revenue (+42% YoY); and 2) a higher share of the\nportfolio coming from the credit card which, as discussed earlier, has higher provisions relative to revenue\nthan our other loan products.\nWe also scaled G&A, Product Development and Sales & Marketing expenses on a reported basis, with 2.8ppts\nof operating leverage. This reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency and ability to deliver cost\ndilution as the business scales.\nAt the country level, in Q2'24 we saw higher margins YoY in Brazil (once the impact of shipping reporting\nupdates is excluded) due to strong cost dilution, and less YoY pressure on margins in Argentina than in Q1'24\ndue to better GMV trends, less pressure on shipping costs and lower funding costs in Fintech. Margins in\nMexico were pressured primarily by: 1) higher provisioning due to growth of the credit business; and 2) higher\nshipping operating costs due to greater seasonal cost headwinds around the Hot Sale event combined with\nthe pressures of operating with limited spare capacity in our fulfillment network.\nNet income rose 103% YoY to $531mn, supported by growth in EBIT and a reduction of FX losses related to\nArgentina. Lower FX losses are a partly function of the narrowing of the gap between the official and blue chip\nswap exchange rates in Argentina, which is a positive impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso (which\nnegatively impacted income from operations). In Q2'24, our net income margin of 10.5% was the highest in the\nlast eight years.\nMercado Libre is generating cash even as we continue to invest to seed future growth opportunities. This\nquarter we are introducing \"adjusted free cash flow\" as a new non-GAAP financial measure that we believe will\nhelp investors better understand the cash generation of our operations. A full explanation can be found in the\n\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this document. Adjusted free cash flow was $678mn in Q2'24 (vs.\n$145mn in Q2'23) and $838mn year-to-date, even with higher capex ($184mn in Q2'24), and funding of the\ncredit portfolio. Our strong cash flow generation, coupled with the reduction in our leverage ratios in recent\nquarters, led to S&P revising its credit rating outlook on Mercado Libre to \"Positive\" in June.\nLooking Ahead\nTomorrow, August 2, 2024, marks 25 years since we founded Mercado Libre with the mission of\ndemocratizing commerce and financial services in Latin America. Over those 25 years, we have built a\nsustainable company that provides millions of small- and medium-sized businesses with the tools they need to\ncompete with larger players; we have enabled the shift to online retail by providing tens of millions of\nconsumers with world-class levels of service; and we have included millions of people into the financial system\nacross the region for the first time. These are notable achievements, but they are also just a baseline from\nwhich we think about our even bigger ambitions to deliver on our mission at an even greater scale. Yet,\nlooking ahead we believe we have more opportunities than we ever have had in our history and we are\nexcited to pursue them with the culture of entrepreneurship, excellence and innovation that has served us so\nwell for the last 25 years.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures can be found in the tables below.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of\naccounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-\nGAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the\nmost comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\nprovides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the\nfuture.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the\neffect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense\nand other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an\nunconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our\nManagement to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation\nof leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it\nprovides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain\nitems.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet income $ 531 $ 262\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 154 128\nInterest income and other financial gains (39) (34)\nInterest expense and other financial losses 39 49\nForeign currency losses, net 58 182\nIncome tax expense 137 210\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 880 $ 797\n14\nQ2’24 Results\nNet debt\nWe define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial\nliabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities\nrestricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have\nincluded this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current\nleverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance\nsheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to\ninvestors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its\ncapability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used\nmeasures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:\nDecember 31,\nJune 30, 2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent Loans payable and other financial liabilities $ 2,203 $ 2,292\nNon-current Loans payable and other financial liabilities 2,439 2,203\nCurrent Operating lease liabilities 138 166\nNon-current Operating lease liabilities 623 672\nTotal debt 5,403 5,333\nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents 2,818 2,556\nShort-term investments (1) 1,271 1,191\nLong-term investments (2) 338 81\nNet debt $ 976 $ 1,505\n(1) Excludes time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee.\n(2) Excludes investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.\n15\nQ2’24 Results\nFX neutral\nWe believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by\nexcluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results\nand business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during\n2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have\nbeen had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany\nallocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local\ncurrency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local\ncurrency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the\nthree-month periods ended June 30, 2024:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nAs reported As recast (1) Percentage F MX e N ase uu rt era sl As recast (1) Percentage\nChange Change\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except percentages) (In millions, except percentages)\nNet revenues and\n$ 5,073 $ 3,585 41.5 % $ 7,645 $ 3,585 113.2 %\nfinancial income\nCost of net revenues\n(2,708) (1,754) 54.4 % (3,737) (1,754) 113.1 %\nand financial expenses\nGross profit 2,365 1,831 29.2 % 3,908 1,831 113.4 %\nOperating expenses (1,639) (1,162) 41.0 % (2,475) (1,162) 113.0 %\nIncome from\n$ 726 $ 669 8.5 % $ 1,433 $ 669 114.2 %\noperations\n(1) Recast for consistency with the current presentation due to the change in the presentation of certain financial results.

We\nconsider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to\nmanagement and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that\ncan be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the\nutility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the\ntotal increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe\nit is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net\nproceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and\ncorporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not\nconsidered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides\nuseful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and\nactivities from the adjusted free cash flow.\n17\nQ2’24 Results\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash\nflow and Net increase in available cash and investments:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities (\"CFO\") $ 3,394 $ 2,271\nAdjustments to reconcile CFO to Adjusted free cash flow (1) 35 23\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds\ndue to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at (701) (693)\ncost\nInvestments in property and equipment and intangible assets (332) (203)\nChanges in loans receivable, net (1,990) (866)\nProceeds from/Payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities related to\n432 (204)\nour Fintech solutions, net\nAdjusted free cash flow 838 328\nProceeds from/Payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to\n45 (61)\nour Commerce and Corporate activities, net\nOther investing and/or financing activities (6) (221)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on available cash and investments (278) 47\nNet increase in available cash and investments $ 599 $ 93\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the beginning of the year 3,828 3,275\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the end of the period 4,427 3,368\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,551) (1,206)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 476 (472)\n(1) Includes accrued interest and financial income net of interest received from available and restricted investments.\n(2) Includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (excluding time deposits and foreign government debt\nsecurities restricted and held in guarantee) and long-term investments (excluding investments held in VIEs as a\nconsequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost).\n> CONTACT:\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor@mercadolibre.com\nhttp://investor.mercadolibre.com\n18"

(Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin\nAmerica’s leading e-commerce and technology company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\nNet revenues and financial income of $4.3 billion, up 36% year-over-year\nand 94% on an FX neutral basis\nIncome from operations of $528 million, with a 12.2% margin\nNet income of $344 million, with a 7.9% margin\n$40.7 billion Total Payment Volume, up 35% year-over-year and 86% on an FX neutral basis\n$11.4 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 20% year-over-year and 71% on an FX neutral\nbasis\nTo our Shareholders\nAs we kick-off our 25th anniversary year, we are as optimistic as ever about the growth potential of Mercado\nLibre. As Latin America's largest ecommerce and fintech platform, we believe that we are uniquely placed to\ncapitalize on the structural shifts that are transforming the region's commerce and financial services markets.\nOver the last few years we have shown our ability to scale the business to fully take advantage of these\nopportunities, whilst delivering continued profitability. Q1'24 is an example of our continued success on this\nfront, with revenue of $4.3bn growing strongly in both Commerce and Fintech, and net income up 71% YoY to\n$344mn, driven by excellent results in Brazil and Mexico.\nCommerce\nOur strong performance in Q1'24 demonstrates the sustainability of growth in our Commerce operations. FX-\nneutral GMV growth remained strong in Brazil (30% YoY) and Mexico (30% YoY), led by items sold growth of\n32% YoY and 28% YoY, respectively. This was despite high comps and Easter falling in Q1 this year (versus Q2\nlast year). Through our consistent investment in technology over many years, we have developed a world\nclass user experience and a leading e-commerce value proposition, which continues to strengthen. This has\nresulted in competitive NPS metrics reaching record levels across countries in Q1'24, higher conversion rates\nacross all of our sites, and unique active buyers growing 25% YoY in Mexico and 18% YoY in Brazil. We have\nalso seen record levels of retention after six, nine and twelve months from our 2023 cohorts. This indicates\nhow we have positioned Mercado Libre as the leader in facilitating the shift of offline spending online, which\nshould drive long-term growth.\nOur initiatives to improve selection are also driving growth across verticals, particularly Fashion, Consumer\nElectronics and Supermarket. Our on-platform payments initiatives are also bearing fruit, with \"split\npayments\" (the ability to use two forms of payment together) launched in Q1'24 in Brazil and Mexico, and the\npenetration of Mercado Pago payment methods rising consistently.\nWe continue to see good traction with MELI+, our loyalty program. Users who enroll in the program increase\ntheir spending and buying frequency and shop across more categories than prior to enrollment. Engagement\nwith MELI Delivery Day has exceeded our expectations, which shows we have succeeded in creating a\ncompelling shipping benefit for the loyalty scheme, which is helping us to have a more competitive offer in low\nASP ranges whilst maintaining discipline in our P&L. We are optimistic about the impact of MELI+ on future\ngrowth and retention as the user base continues to scale.\nOur focus on operational excellence in our shipping network resulted in late deliveries reaching record lows,\nwhilst the average speed of our delivery promises is close to record highs in Q1'24, despite initiatives like MELI\nDelivery Day reducing average speed. This was helped by an increase in fulfillment penetration of almost\n8ppts YoY, which means we surpassed the 50% mark for the first time in Q1'24, reaching an average of 52%.\nWe have been able to keep the cost per package of fulfilled orders broadly stable YoY, with the gap against\nother delivery types narrowing as we continue to pursue productivity, efficiency and scale gains.\n1\nQ1’24 Results\nAs we think about our future growth, we will continue to invest in our logistics network as fast and reliable\nshipping is core to our value proposition and a key competitive advantage. We consider the intensity of these\ninvestments to be business as usual (rather than a step-change) to support growth.\nOur Advertising business had another strong quarter, growing revenues 64% YoY and reaching a penetration\nof 1.9% of GMV (up 50bps YoY). We saw improvements in all major markets, with Mexico standing out,\nparticularly in cross-border. We continued to deploy initiatives in Q1'24 to drive monetization, such as\nimproved algorithms, better placements and new use cases. At the same time, we continue to attract new\nusers to the platform. Most of our Ads revenue continues to come from Products Ads, and we see a\ntremendous long-term growth opportunity in Brand and Display Ads, as well as Video Ads as Mercado Play\ngains traction. We remain optimistic about the long-term contribution of our Advertising business to the\nmonetization of our platform.\nArgentina had a difficult quarter in Commerce, with FX-neutral GMV growth of 214% YoY, below inflation, and\nitems sold decreasing by 4% YoY. However, our marketplace model is resilient to this type of macro situation,\nso the business has outperformed wider consumption trends in Argentina. This strengthens our long-term\nposition in the country. Furthermore, our diversification across geographies - with stellar performance in Brazil\nand Mexico, and improving momentum in Chile (items sold +21% YoY, accelerating for the fourth consecutive\nquarter) - enabled us to deliver solid consolidated GMV growth of 20% YoY.\nFintech Services\nMercado Pago's position continued to strengthen in Q1'24, with monthly active users (\"MAUs\") reaching 49mn\nand growth accelerating to 38% YoY from 32% YoY in Q4'23. We are seeing better retention and an increase\nin the average number of products used on our platform in our more recent cohorts. These higher user and\nengagement trends are particularly strong in Brazil. These are indications of the strength of our value\nproposition and our ability to cross-sell, both of which are crucial as we increase principality amongst a\ngrowing portion of our user base.\nAssets under management (\"AUM\") grew strongly (+90% YoY) in Q1'24. AUM more than doubled YoY in Brazil\nand Mexico, and grew at 64% YoY in Argentina despite the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Asset\nmanagement is a good entry door to our fintech platform, and in Q1'24, users of this product doubled YoY in\nArgentina and tripled in Mexico. Brazil also showed strong growth, helped by the recent launch of the Conta\nTurbinada, which offers the highest remuneration in the market (if the user deposits at least R$1,000 in a given\nmonth) and contributed to improvements in the NPS of the Mercado Pago account. We are also seeing\nencouraging results in Insurtech, with more than 11mn active policies and 8.1mn users.\nWe are uniquely positioned to offer credit products to our users profitably as the relationships and data from\nour ecosystem provide competitive advantages in distribution and underwriting. We had another strong\nperformance in our credit business in Q1'24 with originations growing at 71% YoY and a portfolio of $4.4bn at\nthe end of the quarter, up 46% YoY. Our confidence to pursue a slightly faster pace of growth is explained by\nrobust asset quality indicators, good results from our efforts to explore new use cases amongst existing users\nof our consumer loans, and solid performance of the most recent cohorts of credit cards in Brazil and Mexico.\nThe Mercado Pago credit card is strategically important as it expands the addressable market of our fintech\nplatform by catering to higher income demographics and driving improvements in frequency and engagement\nin Fintech and Commerce. In Q1'24 we issued more than 1.5mn new cards in Brazil and Mexico and credit card\nTPV grew 173% YoY (FX-neutral) as we continue to improve our scoring models and the portfolio's economics.\nOur credit business continues to be very profitable, and delivered a NIMAL spread of 31.5% in Q1'24. This is up\nYoY despite a headwind from a larger share of the lower-NIMAL credit card in the portfolio (35% in Q1'24 vs.\n22% in Q1'23). Asset quality remained robust with 90+ NPLs decreasing by 80bps from last quarter and 10ppts\nfrom a year ago. The increase in the 15-90 day NPL from 8.2% in Q4'23 to 9.3% in Q1'24 is mostly because of\nthe timing of Easter, meaning the quarter ended with four days of holidays, which reduced collection activity. A\nshift in the mix of risk cohorts - which has been appropriately priced for - also contributed.\n2\nQ1’24 Results\nAcquiring\nWe have big ambitions for our Acquiring business across geographies, and we have built solid foundations on\nwhich to pursue those ambitions. With more than two decades of experience of processing payments in Latin\nAmerica, we have built a competitive, cost efficient platform with our proprietary acquiring engine at its core.\nOur Acquiring business also had a very strong quarter, with TPV growing 26% YoY. Growth was driven by\nBrazil and Mexico, which offset headwinds from Argentina. In Brazil, with FX-neutral Acquiring TPV growth\nimproving to 31% YoY, we saw a re-acceleration of both online and offline TPV. Mexico delivered another\nquarter of triple-digit FX-neutral growth in POS, as we continue to execute well in a country where we consider\nourselves to be driving the digitalization of payments. We see large market share opportunities in both\nmarkets, which we expect to drive future growth. Argentina's performance was resilient despite the tough\nmacro environment, with FX-neutral Acquiring TPV up 318% YoY, growing in real terms. This points to the\nstrong traction that our brand has in Argentina, which is an asset that we continue to leverage.\nIn Brazil we launched our Point Smart 2, a device with significantly longer battery life and faster processing, to\ncontinue moving upmarket to serve larger merchants. In the long tail, our device-free Point Tap solution saw a\n63% rise in the number of sellers who used it during Q1. In Online Payments, the number of logged payers\ngrew by 35% YoY, resulting in record high Net Promoter Scores from payers in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.\nReporting Updates\nBefore turning to the detail of our Q1'24 financial results, we would like to highlight some updates to our\nreporting. These updates are intended to better reflect the reality of each of our business models and how\nthey operate. The first update is the exclusion of internal Mercado Pago peer-to-peer transfers from our TPV\n(approximately $7bn in Q1'24), which we believe creates a more relevant metric for investors to track a\nbusiness that has evolved from a payments wallet into a full fintech services platform.\nThe second update reclassifies Mercado Pago interest income and expense lines from below income from\noperations to above income from operations. These revenues and costs are operational in nature in a fintech\nbusiness model, so this update enhances disclosure and makes Mercado Pago's reporting consistent with\npeers. In Q1'24, this reclassification led to an increase of $99mn in net revenue and $44mn in cost of revenue\nwith a net positive impact of $55mn on gross profit and income from operations. The reclassification has no\nimpact on net income. For comparative purposes, we have recast our 2023 financials in our 10-Q.\nThe final update relates to Mercado Envios, where a change to our terms & conditions shifts our role to\n\"Principal\" in a majority of shipping transactions. Shipping revenues in such transactions are booked on a\ngross basis, with associated expenses booked in cost of revenue (rather than netted against revenue when\nacting as \"Agent\"). This had a positive impact of $293mn on net revenue and a negative impact of $308mn on\ncost of revenue, with a small net negative impact of $15mn on gross profit and income from operations and\n$10mn on net income. Despite being almost neutral to profitability, there is some dilution to operating and net\nincome margins because of higher net revenue. Given this change follows our existing accounting policies,\n2023 financials have not been recast.\n3\nQ1’24 Results\nConsolidated Financial Results\nWe started the year with great momentum as net revenue of $4,333mn grew 36% YoY on a reported basis (or\n30% if we exclude the reporting updates discussed above). Growth was driven by particularly strong trends in\nBrazil (+57% YoY; +44% excluding reporting updates) and Mexico (+59% YoY; +55% excluding reporting\nupdates) which more than offset the impact of the devaluation and weak macro trends in Argentina (-22% YoY;\n-19% excluding reporting updates). Revenue growth was robust in both Commerce (+49% YoY; +31% excluding\nreporting updates) and Fintech (+22% YoY; +28% excluding reporting updates).\nIncome from operations reached $528mn on a reported basis, growing 26% YoY against Q1'23 figures that\nhave been recast to reflect the reclassification of Mercado Pago interest income and expenses. If we were to\nexclude the impact of reporting updates from Q1'24 and Q1'23 to help investors compare with the numbers we\nreported last year, income from operations would have grown 44% YoY to $488mn. YoY growth is lower on a\nreported basis because the reclassified interest income & expense declined, primarily related to Argentina.\nOur geographies outside of Argentina delivered excellent results, with YoY income from operations margin\nexpansion of 560bps (as detailed in our Q1'24 investor presentation) on a reported basis. This was due to\nhigher Ads penetration, better profitability in Credits and 1P, and dilution of Sales & Marketing, G&A and\nProduct Development expenses.\nThe Q1'24 consolidated income from operations margin of 12.2% declined by 90bps YoY when compared to\nQ1'23 recast figures. This includes the following headwinds from reporting updates: a) 120bps from the\nincrease in shipping revenue booked on a gross basis; and b) 90bps due to the YoY decline in reclassified\nMercado Pago interest income & expenses. So on an underlying basis - which excludes reporting updates and\ncompares with figures disclosed last year - the margin would have improved by 120bps YoY (as detailed in our\nQ1'24 investor presentation).\nThis 120bps margin improvement is a combination of a 620bps margin gain from the strong performance of\ngeographies outside Argentina, which more than offsets the 500bps compression from Argentina. This strong\nperformance more than offset the following headwinds on the consolidated P&L: a) investments in shipping, b)\ncredit provisions; and c) Argentina's performance in Q1'24.\nAs expected, logistics cost pressures from peak season in Q4'23 subsided in Q1'24, so net shipping costs fell\nby approximately $90mn QoQ. This is an improvement of 20bps as a percentage of GMV, which would have\nbeen 50bps without incremental pressure from Argentina.\nFulfillment and free shipping are key components of our value proposition and investments in these areas led\nto a 60bps YoY increase in net shipping costs as a percentage of GMV in Q1'24. The successful adoption of\nMELI+ resulted in higher free shipping penetration (+6ppts YoY) and accounted for 20bps of this overall cost\nincrease. Our investments in fulfillment, whose penetration surpassed 50% in Q1'24, accounted for the other\n40bps. Cost pressures have been mitigated by last year's Flat Fee increase and progress on improving\nproductivity. We have a solid track record of mitigating shipping cost increases since 2018, despite major\ninvestments in service levels.\nThe growth of our credit business also put some pressure on margins as provisions for doubtful accounts\nincreased by 70bps as a percentage of sales in Q1'24 on a reported basis (120bps excluding the impact of\nreporting updates). Part of this increase relates to mix, with Argentina - where provisions are lowest - losing\nshare in our revenue because of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. The remainder was the natural\nconsequence of the faster pace of sequential growth in Q1'24 compared to a year ago, given that we provision\n100% of expected losses at the moment of origination, with revenue recognized over the lifetime of the loan.\n4\nQ1’24 Results\nThe table below - which we have disclosed since Q2'23 to help investors understand the financials exposed to\na devaluation - highlights the operating deleverage in Argentina, with a 68% YoY decline in reported income\nfrom operations in Argentine Pesos. This was due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, GMV growth\nbelow inflation and significantly higher costs in shipping, amongst other pressures. The remainder of the\nbusiness delivered an outstanding performance, with 136% YoY growth in income from operations. The share\nof Argentina in our total income from operations has fallen to less than 15% from more than 50% a year ago.\nUS dollars (millions); Total ARS Other\nthree months to March 31, 2024 MercadoLibre denominated currencies\nNet revenues and financial income 4,333 615 3,718\nCost of net revenue and financial expenses, and\noperating expenses (3,805) (544) (3,261)\nIncome from operations 528 71 457\n-- YoY growth 26 % (68) % 136 %\nIncome from operations margin 12.2 % 11.5 % 12.3 %\n-- YoY variation 0.9ppts (17.0)ppts 4.2ppts\nWe think net income provides investors with the clearest view of the business' underlying profitability trends,\ngiven the impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Net income grew 71% YoY to $344mn in Q1'24 with\na margin of 7.9%, or 9.0% excluding reporting updates. As such, our net income margin has risen by 500bps\nover the last two years on revenue that has almost doubled. This is primarily due to strong growth and\nprofitability gains in Brazil and Mexico, which is a result of the combination of growth, scale and operational\nefficiency that drove operating leverage in Q1'24. Whilst the devaluation of the Argentine Peso negatively\nimpacts income from operations, it also reduces FX losses as the distortions created by the country's dual FX\nrate regime begin to normalize. FX losses fell to $34mn in Q1'24 (of which $21mn relate to cash repatriation)\nfrom $107mn in Q4'23 and $87mn in Q1'23. Our net income therefore grew at a faster pace than income from\noperations, underlining the resilience and excellent performance of the business.\nCapex investments totaled $148mn in Q1'24, similar to previous quarters, as we continue to steadily invest in\nour logistics network. Debt ratios have improved on the back of our strong results and cash flow over the last\n12 months, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA falling to 0.5x in Q1’24 from 1.25x a year ago.\nLooking Ahead\nAs we kick off our 25th anniversary year, Mercado Libre is in great shape. Over the last two and a half\ndecades, we have built a profitable business with solid foundations and leadership positions across Latin\nAmerica. This puts us in a position of considerable strength in a region that offers immense opportunities for\ngrowth. In Commerce, we still see plenty of opportunity for more buyers, more frequency and more retail to\nshift online; in Fintech, we see substantial demand for better and simpler financial services, as well as the\ntrend of digitalization of cash. By investing in technology and driving innovation as we look forward to our next\n25 years, Mercado Libre intends to continue to be at the forefront of efforts to capture those secular growth\nopportunities. We are optimistic about MercadoLibre's growth potential and its long-term profitability. After all,\nwe believe the best is yet to come.\n5\nQ1’24 Results\nThe following table summarizes certain key performance metrics for the three-month periods ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(IN MILLIONS, except %) (*) 2024 2023\nFintech monthly active users 49 36\nUnique active buyers 53 46\nGross merchandise volume $ 11,365 $ 9,434\nNumber of items sold 385 309\nNumber of items shipped 379 302\nTotal payment volume (**) $ 40,727 $ 30,270\nAcquiring total payment volume $ 30,579 $ 24,256\nTotal payment transactions (**) 2,418 1,555\nNIMAL 31.5 % 30.6 %\nCapital expenditures $ 148 $ 89\nDepreciation and amortization $ 154 $ 126\n(*) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most\ncomparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of\naccounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-\nGAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the\nmost comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\nprovides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the\nfuture.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the\neffect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense\nand other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an\nunconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our\nManagement to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation\nof leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it\nprovides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain\nitems.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet income $ 344 $ 201\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 154 126\nInterest income and other financial gains (25) (23)\nInterest expense and other financial losses 38 34\nForeign currency losses, net 34 87\nIncome tax expense 137 122\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entity — (3)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 682 $ 544\n14\nQ1’24 Results\nNet debt\nWe define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial\nliabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities\nrestricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have\nincluded this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current\nleverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance\nsheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to\ninvestors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its\ncapability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used\nmeasures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31, 2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent Loans payable and other financial liabilities $ 2,246 $ 2,292\nNon-current Loans payable and other financial liabilities 2,224 2,203\nCurrent Operating lease liabilities 163 166\nNon-current Operating lease liabilities 653 672\nTotal debt 5,286 5,333\nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents 2,579 2,556\nShort-term investments (1) 1,173 1,191\nLong-term investments (2) 167 81\nNet debt $ 1,367 $ 1,505\n(1) Excludes time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee.\n(2) Excludes investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.\n15\nQ1’24 Results\nFX neutral\nWe believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by\nexcluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results\nand business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during\n2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have\nbeen had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany\nallocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local\ncurrency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local\ncurrency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the\nthree-month period ended March 31, 2024:\nThree-Months ended ͏March 31,\nAs reported As recast (1) FX Neutral As recast (1)\nPercentage Measures Percentage\nChange Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(In millions, except percentages) (In millions, except percentages)\nNet revenues and\n$ 4,333 $ 3,186 36.0 % $ 6,188 $ 3,186 94.2 %\nfinancial income\nCost of net revenues\n(2,309) (1,572) 46.9 % (3,105) (1,572) 97.5 %\nand financial expenses\nGross profit 2,024 1,614 25.4 % 3,083 1,614 91.0 %\nOperating expenses (1,496) (1,196) 25.1 % (2,453) (1,196) 105.1 %\nIncome from\n$ 528 $ 418 26.3 % $ 630 $ 418 50.7%\noperations\n(1) Recast for consistency with the current presentation due to the change in the presentation of certain financial results.

This was due\nto outstanding results in Brazil and Mexico, which offset weakness in Argentina.\nKey Messages • Commerce momentum remains strong: YoY FX-neutral GMV growth in Brazil (30%)\nand Mexico (30%) was solid, even against high comps, whilst Argentina’s growth of\n214% was below inflation.

Mercado Pago’s credit portfolio grew 46% YoY\nand reached $4.4bn, with the credit card being the main driver of growth. NIMAL***\nof 31.5% was up slightly YoY, despite the negative mix impact of the credit card.\n• Acquiring growth remained resilient. Acquiring TPV of almost $31bn grew 26% YoY\nin USD, with accelerating FX-neutral growth in Brazil and Mexico offsetting a decline\nin TPV (in USD) in Argentina following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\n• As detailed in the appendix of this presentation, and in our upcoming quarterly report on Form\n10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2024, Mercado Pago’s interest income & expense\nlines have been reclassified to net revenue and cost of net revenue, whilst changes to\nMercado Envios’ terms & conditions mean that more shipping revenue is now booked on a\ngross basis (“Principal”) rather than on a net basis (“Agent”). Finally, we now exclude internal\nMercado Pago peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers from our TPV definition. For purposes of\ncomparison, financial figures in this presentation are presented on a reported basis as well as\na “comparable basis\", which excludes the impact of the aforementioned reporting updates.\n*MAU refers to Monthly Active Users; **AUM refers to Assets Under Management;***NIMAL refers to net interest margin\nafter losses, which is credit revenues (APRs and late fees) net of provisions for doubtful accounts and funding costs.

Had our current Mercado Envios T&C been in place at the time, revenue would have been recognized on a gross basis and these costs would have been booked as costs of net\nrevenue.\nMillions of US Dollars Q1'23 (partial)* Q1'23 (full)* Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 FY'23 (full) Q1’24\nTotal carrier costs that would have\nmove from Agent to Principal following 186 340 370 412 526 1,648 293\nchanges to T&C\n--- Brazil 163 206 219 243 299 967 254\n--- Argentina 5 23 25 29 39 116 7\n--- Mexico 16 94 107 123 168 492 30\n--- Others 2 17 19 17 20 73 2\nThe update to our Mercado Envios T&Cs, and, as a result, the shift in the recognition of these costs, occurred in mid-January in Brazil and\nmid-March in our Hispanic markets. The “Q1’23 (partial)” column below shows costs for the same time period, whereas the\n“Q1’23 (full)” column shows the same costs for a full quarter. The “Q1’24” column shows the costs that were booked as cost of net revenue\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nMercado Libre will continue to be considered as acting as “Agent” for some shipping transactions, mainly for commercial carriers. The\nchanges described above do not apply to these carrier costs and, as such, they will continue to be netted against revenue.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.
