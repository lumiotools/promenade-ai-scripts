(Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com),\nLatin America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nNet revenues & financial income of $5.3 billion, up 35% YoY and 103% FX-neutral\nIncome from operations of $557 million, with a 10.5% margin\nNet income of $397 million, with a 7.5% margin\n$50.7 billion Total Payment Volume, up 34% YoY and 73% FX-neutral\n$12.9 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 14% YoY and 71% FX-neutral\nTo our Shareholders\nWe are pleased to report another quarter of growth in Q3'24. Momentum is strong across the business, with\nsolid growth in unique buyers, Fintech monthly active users (MAU), GMV, the credit portfolio and acquiring\nTPV in all major geographies. We believe we are making excellent progress on our long-term strategic goals\nof increasing the penetration of online commerce in Latin America, becoming the principal financial services\nprovider to users of Mercado Pago and scaling our acquiring business. Our competitive position is\nstrengthening as retention improves across our businesses. This gives us great confidence as we invest to\nfully capitalize on the many growth opportunities that are ahead of us, knowing that our ecosystem is uniquely\nplaced to capture those opportunities.\nCommerce\nWe are excited about the prospect of driving offline retail online in Latin America, where ecommerce\npenetration lags the USA by almost a decade. We see a huge runway for growth. We executed well on this\nopportunity in Q3'24, with very strong FX-neutral GMV growth of 34% YoY in Brazil and 27% YoY in Mexico. In\nArgentina, items sold grew by an impressive 16% YoY as consumption trends continued to improve. Market\nshare grew in all major geographies. Unique buyers across the region reached almost 61mn, rising 21% YoY.\nThis is the second quarter in succession that unique buyer growth has accelerated to a new post-pandemic\nhigh. This performance reinforces our conviction in the investments we are making to capture the long-term,\nstructural growth opportunities ahead of us.\nOffline to online is a secular trend, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum; it is fueled by innovation and investment\nto constantly improve the online buying experience. Initiatives in Q3'24 included the launch of installation\nappointments for autoparts, bulk purchase discounts in apparel, virtual try-on for makeup and dynamic pricing\ntools for sellers. Despite being the leading ecommerce platform with 25 years of history in the region, we still\nsee plenty of scope to expand our user base given the population of more than 650mn in Latin America.\nIn Q3’24 we split our loyalty scheme, MELI+, into two tiers called “MELI+ Essencial” and “MELI+ Total”. \"Meli+\nEssencial\", at just below $2 per month, provides users with a unique package of ecosystemic benefits\nincluding a lower threshold for free shipping, extra installments on purchases in Mercado Libre and cashback\non purchases on and off Mercado Libre. The “MELI+ Total”, at roughly $5 per month, includes all these\necosystemic benefits plus access to content from Disney+ and Deezer, and discounts on other streaming\nservices. With these changes, we are extending the reach of our loyalty scheme providing more value to\nusers.\n2\nQ3’24 Results\nOur logistics network is a powerful tool to drive offline retail online by providing a better user experience for\nboth buyers and sellers. Fulfillment leads to higher GMV growth because of faster delivery promises, higher\nconversion and stronger buyer and seller NPS. This is a self-reinforcing process that repeats as we increase\nfulfillment. This is the reason why we continue investing in expanding our logistics infrastructure to increase\nthe penetration of fulfillment in Brazil and to keep up with the strong pace of growth in our Commerce\noperation in Mexico. As such, we opened five fulfillment centers in Brazil in Q3'24, plus one in Mexico.\nAlthough new facilities can create short-term margin pressure, they are critical to our long-term growth, scale\nand cost dilution.\n1P GMV surpassed last year's peak quarter (Q4'23) due to growth of 62% YoY in Q3'24. Our strategy of\nexpanding our product assortment at competitive prices where there are gaps in our 3P selection is\nsucceeding. We introduced presale functionality for the iPhone 16 launch, for which we had a full assortment\nand competitive prices. We also had exclusivity for the launch of the Motorola G85, an accessible smartphone\nwith a premium design. These examples show how 1P is turning MELI into a destination for categories in which\nwe have historically had less presence in. As we scale 1P, we continue to see improvements in its profitability.\nAs such, 1P did not act as a drag on the YoY evolution of our income from operations margin Q3'24.\nAdvertising is a strong profit driver for Mercado Libre, with significant potential for growth as the digital Retail\nMedia trend gathers steam and first-party data becomes increasingly important. We also see growth\nopportunities as we build our presence in advertising formats beyond Product Ads, which currently accounts\nfor most of our revenue. Advertising revenue grew 37% YoY in Q3'24, well ahead of GMV, reaching a\npenetration of 2.0% of GMV, up 30 bps YoY.\nFintech Services\nWe have great momentum in Fintech Services as more users choose Mercado Pago as their financial services\npartner. MAU rose 35% YoY to 56mn in Q3'24. Engagement is rising, with \"power users\" (those transacting in\nnine out of the last twelve weeks) growing at a much faster rate, and transactions and products per MAU also\nrising. The expansion of our credit offer, particularly the Mercado Pago credit card, and rising awareness of\nour remunerated account are driving this performance, as well as NPS gains.\nThe credit card had another good quarter in Q3'24, with the portfolio of $2.3bn growing strongly by 172% YoY\nand 28% QoQ. We are scaling the credit card at pace because our scoring models are increasingly accurate\nand our older cohorts are showing a good path towards profitability (with solid NIMAL spreads), with some of\nthem already being profitable. In Q3’24 we invested $76mn in scaling our credit card portfolio. Despite short-\nterm margin pressure, these investments are strategically important because the credit card drives the\nadoption of Mercado Pago as a principal account and brings positive ecosystemic behavior.\nThe total credit portfolio grew at its fastest pace since Q1'22, rising 77% YoY to $6.0bn. Growth was strong\nacross products and geographies. The consumer book grew 37% YoY, helped by successfully extending\nlarger, longer duration loans to lower risk users in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The portfolio in Argentina\nreached record levels and delivered solid profitability. We also surpassed the milestone of $1bn in merchant\nloans across the region for the first time. Our consumer and merchant loans are a solid source of profitability\nthat more than offset the investments in our credit card.\nThe NIMAL spread of 24% fell 13ppts YoY, despite solid asset quality indicators with broadly stable roll rates\nand the 15-90 day NPL of 7.8%. There were three reasons behind the reduction in NIMAL: the ramp up of the\ncredit card, the move upmarket in consumer and merchant credit, and the overall acceleration of our credit\noriginations in the quarter.\nAs we scale the credit card, its share in the total portfolio rose from 25% in Q3'23 to 39% in Q3'24. This\ncreated a negative mix effect on NIMAL, because the credit card is a structurally lower spread product. The\nsecond reason for the NIMAL decline was our strategic decision to continue moving upmarket with our credit\noffering to lower risk users with lower spreads. This is incremental to portfolio dollars and has a positive\nimpact on NPS. Finally, we accelerated our origination across products in this quarter and, given that we\nprovision our expected losses up front, this resulted in higher bad debt in this quarter.\n2\nQ3’24 Results\nTrends in fintech services more broadly are encouraging. Assets under management (AUM) had another\noutstanding quarter, growing 93% YoY to $8.0bn. A large part of this is our remunerated account, which is\ncore to our value proposition as an entry point for wider engagement with Mercado Pago. Marketing\ncampaigns in Brazil and Mexico have led to a positive cycle of greater awareness, more users and higher\nbalances, all of which drive higher NPS. This, in turn, brings more users to our platform. We have seen this\nwork fantastically well in Argentina in recent years and more recently in Mexico, where funds invested in our\nremunerated account increased 345% YoY. Insurtech is scaling well (revenues growing 36% YoY), with great\ncross-selling around the ecosystem. For example, we launched a credit card insurance product in Q3'24 that\nhelps to accelerate the payback on the investment we are making in the credit card.\nAcquiring\nAcquiring performed well in Q3'24 as we scale the business across the region. Acquiring TPV grew 30% YoY\nin Brazil on an FX-neutral basis, with the POS business accelerating. We see plenty of growth potential in\nBrazil, our largest acquiring market. A differentiated offer is key to fully capitalizing on this opportunity. We\nlaunched software for merchants that use our POS devices in Q3’24 as a new front in this strategy. Initially, the\npackage enables merchants to create a product catalog, issue tax receipts and manage inventory. Over time,\nwe intend to layer on additional capabilities. The software is fully integrated with our ecosystem, so merchants\nthat sell on our marketplace can automatically download their product catalog to their Mercado Pago POS. We\nalso continue to cross-sell our fintech services, including credit, as another important differentiator and a\nsource of monetization.\nIn Argentina, acquiring TPV growth picked up in real terms (discounting inflation). This shows the strength of\nthe Mercado Pago brand, its role as a disruptive force in payments in Argentina and the improvement in wider\nconsumption trends. Acquiring TPV growth was solid in Mexico at 46% YoY (FX-neutral) with in-store\npayments growing at more than 100% YoY. We have a huge opportunity in Mexico to lead the transition to\ndigital payments.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nNet revenue and financial income reached $5,312mn in Q3'24, growing 35% YoY despite FX headwinds in all\nthree major geographies. The shipping reporting updates outlined in our Q1'24 Shareholder Letter contributed\n13ppts ($513mn) to growth. Net revenue grew strongly in Brazil and Mexico, with both delivering FX-neutral\ngrowth of 60% YoY. In Argentina, FX-neutral revenue grew 245% YoY, ahead of inflation and at a slightly\nfaster pace of real growth when compared to Q2'24. Both Commerce and Fintech revenue streams are\ngrowing well, up 48% YoY (of which 24ppts relates to shipping reporting updates) and 21% YoY respectively,\ndespite FX headwinds.\nQ3'24 income from operations reached $557mn, with a margin of 10.5% and a reduction of 9.5ppts YoY on a\nreported basis. Approximately 2ppts of the YoY margin decline relates to the dilutive impact of the shipping\nreporting updates outlined in Q1'24, and the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina following the\nreclassification of Mercado Pago interest income and expense above EBIT (also in Q1'24). Excluding these two\neffects, the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts on a comparable basis.\nMost of this 7.4ppts margin compression is due to strategic investment decisions that we made in the quarter,\nwhich included:\n1. The investment in our credit business, which increases our upfront provisions and generates the\nlargest single contributor (3.4ppts) to the YoY margin decline. As we explained before, we accelerated\norigination across all of our credit products (portfolio +77% YoY) and there was also a shift in the credit\nmix towards the credit card, which increased its share in the credit portfolio from 25% in Q3'23 to 39%\nin Q3'24.\n2. The investment in shipping, whose effect on margins is partially diluted by higher GMV and intense\nwork to improve productivity. The overall cost impact on our consolidated income from operations\nmargin from investments in logistics in Q3'24 was 0.8ppts YoY (as per the gross margin bridge in our\nearnings presentation).\n3\nQ3’24 Results\nIn addition to these effects, the accruals for variable compensation under the Long Term Retention Plan (LTRP)\nincreased 0.7ppts as a result of a larger share price increase in Q3'24 vs. Q3'23. G&A expenses rose 1.1ppts\nYoY, of which 0.8ppts were due to a non recurring expense that relates to certain customer refunds for prior\nperiods. The remaining margin pressures come from business-as-usual cost volatility.\nIncome from Operations Margin\n-950 bps\n-740 bps\ncomparable\n20.0%\n18.2%\n0.2%\n(1.8)%\n(2.2)% (0.3)% (1.1)% (0.7)% 10.8% 0.7% 10.5%\n(3.4)% (1.0)%\nEBIT Mercado Pago EBIT COGS Marketing G&A Product LTRP Bad Debt EBIT Margin Mercado Update to EBIT\nMargin Interest Margin Expenses Development Q3'24 Pago Shipping Margin\nQ3'23 Income & Q3'23 As & Sales Comparable Interest T&C Q3'24\nRecast Expense Reported Expenses Income & Reported\nReclassificationLast Year Expense\nAs Reported in 10-Q Q3’24 comparable with\nQ3’23 as reported in 2023\nThe 7.4 ppts margin compression described above, includes the net impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian\nReal and the Mexican Peso during Q3´24\nAs we mentioned in previous quarters, the Net Income result adjusts for the FX distortions we have seen in\nArgentina during 2023. In Q3'24 Net income rose 11% YoY to $397mn resulting in a Net Income margin of\n7.5%. Lower EBIT was partially offset by a significant reduction in FX losses related to Argentina and lower\nincome taxes. As a consequence, even though the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts compared to last year,\nNet Income Margin only compressed by 1.1ppt as described in the chart below:\nNet Income Margin\n-160 bps\n-110 bps\ncomparable\n9.1% 0.4% 9.5%\n2.0% 8.4%\n7.5%\n5.5%\n(0.2)%\n(2.2)% (0.7)%\n1.2%\n(5.2)%\n(2.4)%\nNet Mercado Pago Net COGS OPEX Interest Financial Foreign Income Net Income Mercado Update to Net\nIncome Interest Income Income Expenses Exchange Tax Margin Pago Shipping Income\nMargin Income & Margin (excl.

Year to date, we have generated more than $635mn of adjusted free cash flow. Our robust\nfinancial flexibility, conservative capital structure and positive long-term fundamentals, led to Fitch upgrading its\ncredit rating on Mercado Libre to Investment Grade in October (BBB-).\nLooking Ahead\nMomentum is fantastic across Mercado Libre, and we are optimistic about the long runway of growth we see\nin commerce, advertising, fintech services and acquiring across our region. We are confident that our\ninvestments are unlocking these structural growth opportunities, and our Q3'24 results are evidence of that.\nWe are committed to investing with discipline to maximize the size of the business in the long-term in a\nsustainable, profitable and cash generative manner. We look ahead with excitement because the best is yet to\ncome.\n5\nQ3’24 Results\nThe following table summarizes certain key performance metrics for the nine and three-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n(IN MILLIONS, except %) (1) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nFintech monthly active users 56 42 56 42\nUnique active buyers 87 74 61 50\nGross merchandise volume $ 36,919 $ 31,299 $ 12,907 $ 11,360\nNumber of items sold 1,262 991 456 357\nNumber of items shipped 1,249 970 453 350\nTotal payment volume (2) $ 137,746 $ 102,278 $ 50,691 $ 37,839\nAcquiring total payment\n$ 100,367 $ 81,221 $ 36,042 $ 29,721\nvolume\nTotal payment transactions (2) 8,030 5,275 2,936 1,991\nNIMAL 28.3 % 35.1 % 24.2 % 37.4 %\nCapital expenditures $ 555 $ 329 $ 223 $ 126\nDepreciation and amortization $ 465 $ 389 $ 157 $ 135\n(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures can be found in the tables below.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of\naccounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-\nGAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the\nmost comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\nprovides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the\nfuture.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the\neffect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense\nand other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an\nunconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our\nManagement to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation\nof leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it\nprovides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain\nitems.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet income $ 397 $ 359\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 157 135\nInterest income and other financial gains (43) (38)\nInterest expense and other financial losses 40 53\nForeign currency losses, net 40 239\nIncome tax expense 123 172\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 714 $ 920\n14\nQ3’24 Results\nNet debt\nWe define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial\nliabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities\nrestricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have\nincluded this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current\nleverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance\nsheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to\ninvestors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its\ncapability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used\nmeasures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent Loans payable and other financial liabilities $ 2,250 $ 2,292\nNon-current Loans payable and other financial liabilities 3,103 2,203\nCurrent Operating lease liabilities 201 166\nNon-current Operating lease liabilities 770 672\nTotal debt 6,324 5,333\nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents 2,162 2,556\nShort-term investments (1) 1,109 1,191\nLong-term investments (2) 1,146 81\nNet debt $ 1,907 $ 1,505\n(1) Excludes time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee.\n(2) Excludes investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.\n15\nQ3’24 Results\nFX neutral\nWe believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by\nexcluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results\nand business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during\n2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have\nbeen had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany\nallocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local\ncurrency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local\ncurrency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the\nthree-month periods ended September 30, 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAs reported As recast (1) Percentage F MX e N ase uu rt era sl As recast (1) Percentage\nChange Change\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except percentages) (In millions, except percentages)\nNet revenues and\n$ 5,312 $ 3,927 35.3 % $ 7,961 $ 3,927 102.7 %\nfinancial income\nCost of net revenues\n(2,873) (1,832) 56.8 % (3,996) (1,832) 118.1 %\nand financial expenses\nGross profit 2,439 2,095 16.4 % 3,965 2,095 89.3 %\nOperating expenses (1,882) (1,310) 43.7 % (2,775) (1,310) 111.8 %\nIncome from\n$ 557 $ 785 (29.0) % $ 1,190 $ 785 51.6 %\noperations\n(1) Recast for consistency with the current presentation due to the change in the presentation of certain financial results.

We\nconsider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to\nmanagement and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that\ncan be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the\nutility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the\ntotal increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe\nit is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net\nproceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and\ncorporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not\nconsidered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider\nNet increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides\nuseful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and\nactivities from the adjusted free cash flow.\n17\nQ3’24 Results\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash\nflow and Net increase in available cash and investments:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities (\"CFO\") $ 4,994 $ 3,212\nAdjustments to reconcile CFO to Adjusted free cash flow (1) 117 19\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds\ndue to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at (1,594) (464)\ncost\nInvestments in property and equipment and intangible assets (555) (329)\nChanges in loans receivable, net (3,316) (1,465)\nProceeds from loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech\n989 94\nsolutions, net\nAdjusted free cash flow 635 1,067\nProceeds from/Payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to\n214 (78)\nour Commerce and Corporate activities, net\nOther investing and/or financing activities 5 (405)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on available cash and investments (265) (85)\nNet increase in available cash and investments $ 589 $ 499\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the beginning of the year 3,828 3,275\nAvailable cash and investments (2), at the end of the period 4,417 3,774\nNet cash used in investing activities (6,159) (2,536)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,202 (340)\n(1) Includes accrued interest and financial income net of interest received from available and restricted investments.\n(2) Includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted\nand held in guarantee) and long-term investments (excluding investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and\nequity securities held at cost).\n> CONTACT:\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor@mercadolibre.com\nhttp://investor.mercadolibre.com\n18"

All\nparticipants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a\nconference specialist by pressing the \"*\" key followed by \"0.\" After today's presentation,\nthere will be an opportunity to ask questions.

Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Cathcart, Investor Relations\nOfficer. Please go ahead.\nRichard Cathcart\nHello everyone, and welcome to the MercadoLibre earnings conference call for the quarter\nended September 30th, 2024. Thank you for joining us. I'm Richard Cathcart,\nMercadoLibre’s investor relations officer. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on\nvideo, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our management team.\nBefore we go on to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2024, I remind you that\nmanagement may make or refer to, and this presentation may contain forward-looking\nstatements and non-GAAP measures. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which\nwill also be available in our earnings materials on our investor relations website.\nWith that, let's begin with the summary of our results.\nMartin de los Santos\nHello everyone. I am pleased to share the MercadoLibre third quarter outstanding growth.\nWe had an excellent quarter across all of our businesses and geographies. So, the strong\nperformance was really all around. With these results, we reinforce our position as the\nleading e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America. Every time we have invested\nin enhancing our customer experience, in the past, we have been rewarded with strong\ngrowth and improvements in our market position. In this quarter, we continue to make\nstrategic investments in our platform, both commerce and fintech and the resulted GMV\ngrowth of 34% year-on-year in Brazil and 27% in Mexico. This also resulted in market\nshare gains in both countries.\nIn Argentina, items sold grew at 16%, and we surpassed the 60 million items sold in our\nplatform, which is the highest ever volume. We continue to see improvements in the\nArgentinian market. We have added a record of almost 7 million new wires into our\nplatform. This is a number higher than the number that we saw during the peak of the\npandemic. So let me be clear on that, not even during the explosion of demand that we\nexperienced in the pandemic, we saw a number of new users at this level.\nAs most of you know, the penetration of e-commerce in Latin America continues to be\nrelatively low when we compare it to other more developed regions. Only 15% of\ncommerce is done online. So, it's plenty of room to continue growing. As the lead player\nin the region, we have a crucial role in driving more volume online and increasing this\npenetration of e-commerce. For that purpose, we continue to invest in our strategic\ninitiatives, such as logistics and our loyalty program.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n2\nIn Q3, we opened 6 new fulfillment centers, 5 in Brazil and 1 in Mexico, and that helps us\nimprove or increase fulfillment penetration by 4.5 percentage points compared to a year\nago. We know that having more volume shipped out of our own fulfillment facilities results\nin a much better user experience for buyers and sellers in faster and more reliable delivery\nspeeds and a much better conversion of volume in turn, results in further growth of the\necosystem.\nInvestment in technology also plays a critical role in bringing more business online\nbecause it removes biofriction. A large team of developers continue to be focused on\nimproving the wire experience and customizing it for each individual vertical. Our\nadvertising business represents a powerful profit engine for MercadoLibre. And once\nagain we had a strong quarter despite FX headwinds that we experienced in Mexico and\nBrazil. Most of the volume of advertising continues to come from product ads, so we see a\ntremendous opportunity going forward on this day on media advertising where we\nourselves are getting started.\nIn Fintech services, the impressive growth of our user base and the rising engagement\nthat we see people having with our products shows that more and more people and\nconsumers are choosing Mercado Pago as their main financial service provider. We\ncontinue to invest behind our credit card as is a critical product to achieve principality\nwithin our users. In Q3, we issued 1.5 million new credit cards. And the credit card TPV\ngrew by 166% compared to last year. As we see improvements in our risk models, we\nhave accelerated the underwriting of credit, not only credit card but also consumer and\nmerchant credit, and this resulted in growth of our portfolio of 77% compared to last year.\nWe know that the faster growth of our credit portfolio, combined with a shift towards more\ncredit card as a percentage of total portfolio puts some short-term pressure on nine-\nmonths spreads. The rather stable NPLs that we have seen and the fact that the earlier\ncohorts of credit cards are already becoming profitable, gives us confidence in our\ninvestments.\nTurning now to our financial results, our strong operational KPIs translated into revenue\ngrowth of 35% year-on-year despite FX headwinds that we suffered in Mexico and Brazil.\nA successful Q3 performance is not just a result of the great execution of our team, but\nalso a testament of the many growth opportunities that lie ahead of us in our business and\necosystem. Our EBIT was $557 million with a 10.5% margin. The majority of the margin\ncompression from last year comes from the strategic initiatives to investments that we\ndiscussed earlier. Investors can find more detail on those investments in our shareholder\nletter.\nNet income rose by 11% compared to last year, reaching $397 million in the quarter, with\nlower EBIT partially offset by a reduction in our FX losses. As we finish our 25th year\nanniversary, we continue to see tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us, both in\ncommerce and Fintech and now also in advertising. We have a clear vision of the future\nand are focused on the long-term growth, profitability and cash flow generation of our\nbusiness.\nNow, I want to share some examples of innovation that we have implemented during the\nquarter. So, I'll turn it back to Richard. I will explain those to you.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n3\nRichard Cathcart\nMercadoLibre is a major driving force of the shift of offline to online commerce and\nfinancial inclusion in Latin America. Continuously investing in our value proposition,\nservice levels and user experience is key to making that happen for years to come. We\nwant to share a snapshot of just some of those investments in innovations today. In\nSeptember, we have created the Melimise benefits package to include cash back or extra\ninstallments on marketplace purchases and new Fintech benefits. This means that users\nare able to get back much more than they pay for subscription, making Melimise the\nsmartest choice for our users. Those fintech benefits include cash back on all purchases\nmade by the Mercado Pago credit card a higher yield on funds held in the remunerated\naccounts. These benefits increase the differentiation of our credit card and digital account.\nCash back is paid in the Meli dollar stable coin and is deposited into users' Mercado Pago\naccounts where it could be held, sold, or used to make purchases on the marketplace.\nWe also introduced an additional tier in Melimise that offers a cheaper plan and gives\nconsumers a choice of 2 plans that best suits their needs. The essential plan includes free\nshipping, cashback or extra installments on marketplace purchases and all of the fintech\nbenefits. Whilst the total plan has all the benefits of the essential plan plus great content\nwith access to Disney+, Deza and discounts on other streaming services.\nMeli Delivery Day continues to be a core and popular piece of our loyalty program. It\nenables free shipping on lower-value items, which drives higher purchase frequency and\nenables us to dilute our last-mile costs. To incentivize the purchase of multiple items for\ndelivery on the users Meli delivery day. We have made our free shipping offer on lower-\nvalue items more visible to the user as they engage with the platform.\nSeveral other initiatives aimed at improving the online purchasing journey have gone live\nin Q3. In Q3, this helps us to attract a record number of new buyers even higher than the\nprevious peak during the COVID pandemic. We continue to develop category-specific UX\nas a way to drive offline retail online vertical by vertical. In Auto Parts, we launched a new\nfeature that enables buyers to schedule an appointment with the mechanic to install the\nitems they are purchasing, and we ship those items directly to the mechanic.\nIn the beauty category, we introduced technology that enables users to see different\nmakeup products applied to their face in our app. This tackles a major barrier to\nconsumers buying makeup online. To increase cross-category shopping, we launched a\nnew tool that suggests a new high frequency category for users to shop, based on that\nindividual users profile. This personalized suggestion includes a shortcut button to a\ncategory on the home page, a special coupon, a personalized landing page and a push\nnotification.\nAn important driver of shifting offline retail online is the shipping experience. In\nSeptember, we announced plans to more than double the number of fulfillment centers in\nBrazil by the end of 2025. This means 11 new operations, five of which were added in Q3.\nThese investments will enable us to increase the number of cities where we deliver on the\nsame day in Brazil by 40%. 63% of these operations will be outside of Sao Paulo as we\nincreasingly regionalize our network. Some of them will be metro fulfillment centers similar\nto the model we introduced in Rio de Janeiro last year, which are smaller operations that\ntarget individual cities.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n4\nThis is just a snapshot of the innovations that have gone live recently, and we have a\nstrong pipeline of innovations that will enhance our position as the destination of choice to\nshop online in Latin America, because as always at MercadoLibre, the best is yet to come.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question and answer session with Martin de los Santos CFO, Ariel\nSzarfsztejn, Commerce President; and Osvaldo Gimenez, Fintech President. To ask a\nquestion, you may press \"*\" then \"1\" on your touchtone. If you're using a speakerphone,\nplease pick up your handset before pressing the key, to withdraw your question, please\npress \"*\" then \"2.\" We ask participants to limit themselves to one question and get back in\nthe queue for any follow-ups' or additional questions. At this time, we'll pause momentarily\nto assemble our roster.\nAnd our first question comes from Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nIrma Sgarz\nYes, thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question. I'd like to ask about the\ncredit card portfolio where we saw was a quite pronounced growth. And there's a twofold\nelement to my question. Firstly, what drove the incremental acceleration in the pace of\nquarter-over-quarter portfolio growth in the third quarter, specifically for the credit card,\nwhere you've sort of been originating at a pretty stable pace over the last couple of\nquarters? I know the messaging generally has been positive, and are about acceleration.\nBut just surprised to see that jump from one quarter to the next, and I was curious to\nunderstand sort of in which geography or customer cohorts you've been leaning into for\nthis…for driving this incremental acceleration and whether we should think of further\nacceleration from here?\nAnd then the second element to that, you emphasized that part of the NIMAL spread\npressures were also from leaning into larger, longer duration loans to lower risk users in\nreally all your geographies. And I was curious if you could just expand a little bit more on\nthat, what does it mean for growth ahead? And if you're generally feeling more confident\nabout your underwriting mechanisms, why wouldn't that make you maybe go into perhaps\nlike slightly higher risk classes where you may be initially seeding smaller loans, but then\nsort of have more of a ramp-up over time as you feel more confident with those new\ncustomers? Thank you.\nOsvaldo Giménez\nThank you, Sgarz. Let me start with the second part of the question about NIMAL and\nthen I move back to credit cards. With regards to NIMAL, yes, NIMAL saw this quarter of\n15% driven by basically three key drivers. The largest one is the ramp-up I'll refer to in a\nminute of the credit card business, whose share in the portfolio rose from 25% a year ago\nto 39% now. And since this is a lower spread product, this increase in product mix or in\ncredit mix affected NIMAL.\nAlso, we are continuing moving up market. We are very, very happy with this. We have\nstarted in the low end, and we're happy with the move up market. And the way to do that\nis with longer durations and also offering larger lines to lower risk customers. These are\ncredits that are very profitable but have lower spreads than the one we had which were\nsmaller to lower income customers.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n5\nAnd the third part of it is that simply by the fact that we have been accelerating the size of\nthe portfolio whenever we grow the portfolio, initially, we have to a higher proportion of\nprovisions and then the revenues from the interest comes afterwards. So, whenever we're\ngrowing very rapidly, there is a hit to NIMAL. And having said that, I would say, asset\nquality indicators are solid…we have had broadly stable growth rates, both for the 15, 90\ndays NPLs, which has been stable at 7.8%.\nNow, moving on to the first part of the question with regards to the credit card. And yes,\nwe are excited with how this business is evolving, both in Brazil and in Mexico. Brazil is a\ncountry where we have been doing this for longer. And the good news we have is that\nwhen we look at all the cohorts for…from 2021 and 2022, all of those already have positive\nvariable contributions and even some cohorts in early 2023 also have a positive value of\ncontributions are already net positive.\nSo, the fact that we are growing so fast and that the recent cohorts represent a significant\npart of our total portfolio makes…has an impact in our returns or in our P&L in the current\nquarter, and we are very excited with how the product is evolving not only because the\ncohorts are already profitable, but also because we see all of the drivers that the increased\npenetration of credit cards bring us from higher Net Promoter Scores, higher increased\ntransactionality in users who have credit cards, both in the marketplace, but also off the\nmarketplace, increased use of other Mercado Pago power products and in general, an\nincrease in principality.\nSo, we are excited with how that is evolving. You mentioned, regarding the number of\ncards we were issuing, I think that beyond the number of cards, which is growing, I think\nthat we are doing two other things. One is increasing the size of the lines, and therefore,\nincreasing the TPV, which we believe is the more relevant metrics in the TPV of the\nportfolio of credit cards. And all of that has been…has resulted in the increase in the\npenetration of cards in the portfolio, as I mentioned before.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Andrew Ruben from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Ruben\nHi, thanks very much for the question. Hoping to dig in a bit to the shipping investments,\ngiven the five distribution centers in Brazil in the quarter being quite sizable. So, hoping\nyou can help give us some color on how long a distribution center typically takes to ramp\nup and reach productivity. And you mentioned the reach outside of Sao Paulo, but\nperhaps if there's any incremental category or capabilities otherwise, these facilities give\nyou? And then related, we recall last year, you had some network capacity constraints\nduring the 4Q holiday season. So, I'm curious with the network expansion so far this year,\nwhat are your views on how the capacity now compares to your demand expectations\nduring the holiday season? Thank you.\nAriel Szarfsztejn\nHey, Andrew, Ariel here. So, yes, as you said, we made a significant progress in terms of\nfacilities for our fulfillment operations. I think we've been saying this for quite some time,\nfulfillment leads to higher GMV because of faster delivery promises, higher conversion\nrates, stronger buyer and seller NPS and from there, higher retention rates. And I think we\nwere clear in the past that we need to grow our fulfillment capacity because of three\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n6\nthings. A, because of the expectation of future demand, we need to grow capacity with\nwhat we think the business will continue to grow in the future. And luckily, we see huge\nopportunity for growth in our marketplaces, both in Brazil and in Mexico.\nSecond, we need higher...we need to build capacity because of the increases in fulfillment\npenetration that we are consistently having in Brazil. And last but not least, there's a\nnormalizing effect of capacity available in Mexico. So overall, we are confident that with\nthis capacity that we are bringing into the network, we will not only have the required\nsquare meters to deal with big demands from our sellers and buyers, but more importantly,\nto continue growing and expanding our business in the different regions.\nIn terms of the first part of your question, ramp-ups and productivity, we are consistently\nmaking progress in shortening the productivity ramp-up window from our representatives,\nbut it's natural, right? So, every time we open a fulfillment center, we start operating with\nlower utilization, which then tends to grow. So yes, to your point, in the short term, you\ncan see some cost pressures, but this capacity is crucial for our growth, for our scale and\nour...for our long-term strategy of serving our users.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Robert Ford from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi,\nRobert, is your line muted? Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos from JP\nMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMarcelo Santos\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the\ndifferences between the Brazil credit card experience and Mexico so far. So, you have\nthese two markets where you're growing. Can you contrast like perhaps NIMAL, NPL\nfrequency, whatever information you could bring would be interesting?\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nMarcelo, I'll say that probably the most relevant difference for us is that when we launched\nthe credit card in Brazil, it was the first time we were doing this. So initially, we started\nrelying on the models we have built for consumer loans. And then we learned and iterated\non how to adjust those models. And every roughly six months, we have been able to roll\nout a new generation of models. And we did learn quite a lot along those lines. Therefore,\nwhen we launched the product in Mexico last year, we had more experience, and really,\nwe're more reliable in terms of what to expect.\nTherefore, I would say the ramp-up in Mexico has been significantly faster than it was in\nBrazil. And also, there are some, I would say, significant differences in the structure of the\nmarket for credit cards in both countries. Clearly, the penetration of credit cards in Brazil is\nsignificantly higher than what it is in Mexico. And therefore, we believe the opportunity in\nMexico is huge. Having said that, there is less public information about how...in credit\nscoring for the users in Mexico. So you have to rely a little more on internal information\nand less third parties information. Also, there are differences in terms of when and how\nthe working capital works in each country because you have to sell the transactions in\nMexico, the next day in Brazil is after 30 days. So, the working capital requirements are\nhigher in Mexico than they are in Brazil. And I think those are the main differences.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n7\nGeoffrey Elliott\nHello. Thanks very much for taking the question. If I could go back to the point about the\ninvestment you're making in fulfillment, you've opened quite a few fulfillment centers in Q3.\nYou've got another, I believe, five or six planned by the end of 2025. Can you give us a\nsense of how long this is going to weigh on margins, weigh on profitability? Because it's\nclearly had a pretty significant impact relative to where you were a quarter or two ago?\nMartin de los Santos\nHi, Geoffrey. It's Martin here. How are you? It's just like you said, we continue...and I\nthink Ariel was mentioning this before, we continue to invest in fulfillment centers in the\ncase of Brazil to increase their fulfillment penetration and to take it to the same level or\nsimilar levels that we have in Mexico. And in Mexico, just to give up the growth of the\nbusiness, which this quarter grew at 27% year-on-year. And I think the...if you look at the\nmargin pressure in this particular quarter, there wasn't a lot of margin compression\nbecause of concealment. Most of the compression came from credit cards, as Osvaldo\nmentioned recently.\nSo to answer your question, we will continue to invest business as usual as we have been\ndoing for the past five years. And if you look back over the past five years, fulfillment\npenetration increased significantly. We have always put some short-term pressure on\nmargins. But because of the incremental volume that it brings because of the better user\nexperience and so on, then we are able to dilute those costs in addition to all the focus that\nwe put on productivity. This quarter, we improved significantly the productivity. The actual\ncost per shipment is down year-on-year even though we have higher penetration of\nfulfillment. So, I think this particular quarter, there wasn't a significant pressure for margins\nbecause of that. But we will continue to invest in fulfillment and business as usual as we\nhave done it in the past.\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nJust to complement, Martin, Geoffrey, another point to highlight here is that not necessarily\nevery new warehouse that we open is a 100 square meter facility, right? So, a few\nquarters back, we announced that we are testing our first metro fulfillment center in Rio de\nJaneiro. This quarter, two of the warehouses that we opened are metro fulfillment centers\nand potentially in the coming years, we will open more of those, which are...have a\ndifferent profile and different type of investment and, of course, different unit economics.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJamie Friedman\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Slide 19. It's the margin\nbridge and specifically about the bad debt call out here. I'm wondering, is that...is that like\nthis fails first of new originations? Or is there something underlying the credit quality that's\nmaybe different than you had modeled?\nMartin de los Santos\nHi, Jamie. How are you? Let me start with the last part of your question. In fact, we are\nvery confident about the credit quality and the prediction of our models, and this is the\nreason, as Osvaldo explained, that we're accelerating our credit origination. So that part is\nnot explaining this 3.4 percentage point compression that you are pointing out to. Here,\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n8\nwhat's happening is that we increased roughly $1 billion portfolio quarter-on-quarter. If you\nwere to look at it year-on-year, we increased by 72%.\nAnd as Osvaldo mentioned, when you increase the portfolio very rapidly as we did this\nquarter, you provision the losses upfront. And that happens not only on credit card, but\nalso on consumer credit and merchant credits, which are very profitable books. But as we\naccelerate, we need to provision upfront, and that generates an incremental bad debt\nwhich is generating a compression margin this quarter. So, it's not related to the\nperformance of the portfolio. When you look at NPLs, which we also published this year,\nyou can see that they are pretty much under control. And the fact that we're accelerating, I\nthink it speaks about our confidence in the way we are originating, which by the way, we're\naccelerating in all of the markets and all of the products. So, we feel very comfortable\nabout the quality of our books.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Craig Maurer from FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer\nYes. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask if you could perhaps separate\nout the margin compression related to one-time costs of setting up new facilities versus the\nongoing cost of operating those facilities. And second, the ad penetration rate was flat or\nunchanged quarter-over-quarter. I was curious what your expectation is for penetration\ngoing into the fourth quarter and perhaps next year, if you can comment on that? Thanks.\nMartin de los Santos\nHi, Craig. It's Martin here. We don't disclose specifics of the margin compression, which\npart we attribute to ramp up versus overall incremental cost of fulfillment. But if you see on\nthe disclosures and the investor letter, you can see that the impact of our investments in\nfulfillment was relatively low, less than 1 percentage point of compression. So that's as\nmuch as I want to say about that. I think as I mentioned earlier, over time, we make up for\nthose short-term pressures through incremental volume, and we feel very comfortable\nabout the investment that we're making in fulfillment.\nAriel Szarfsztejn\nSo, hey Craig, this is Ariel. To your question about that, we are pleased with the\nperformance we had this quarter. We grew 86% in FX neutral, 37% in US dollars. And as\nyou said, we reached 2% of revenues over GMB this quarter. That's an increase of 0.3\npercentage point's year-over-year, with Brazil and Mexico reaching record high penetration\nonce again. So, we are happy with the fact that ads revenues are growing well above our\nGMV. We continue to see great potential for our ads business in the future as we develop\nmore technology, better product stack across the full funnel of advertising, still growth will\nnever be linear, so we are not focused on analyzing what's happening quarter-over-\nquarter. There are seasonality, mix effects, FX, whatever, many, many levers. They are\nthat do explain changes. But conceptually, we are excited with the progress we are\nmaking and see great results from all of our efforts. Thank you.\nOperator\nAgain, if you have a question please press \"*\" then \"1\". Our next question comes from\nDeepak Mathivanan from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n9\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, on the ramp in credit cards, can you give\nus some color based on historical cohorts, how it's likely to drive volume growth either on\ne-commerce or fintech over the next few quarters? Is there anything you can share on\ntypical customer behavior post the issuance of the credit cards just in terms of the benefits\nto e-commerce and then on the processing side? And then secondly, just to get some\nspecifics on the NIMAL difference between the various products, how does it differ\nbetween credit cards and consumer credit? How much is NIMAL generally lower in credit\ncards? So that we can think about modeling the headwinds for the future a little more\nprecisely. Thank you so much.\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nHello Deepak. So, with regards to the impact the credit card has on our users and\necosystem and what we see…the first thing we see is those users who have access to\ncredit cards start using it. And on top of that, start using also a credit line. The users who\nare happy with MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago, they have the highest engagement.\nThey use our products more often. They buy more on the marketplace. So clearly, it\nincreases the engagement those users have with us. And then you, those are…those\nusers who have all of these products. Then second next are those who use a credit card\nand then those who use our credit and so on. But basically, getting a credit card\nsignificantly increases engagement.\nAlso, another factor that is very relevant is when you look at penetration of payment\nmethods within the marketplace, we see that we were already building a proportion of mix\nthat was coming from our consumer loans. Mexico probably is a great case because it\nwas exactly the case where we had the highest penetration of consumer loans within the\nmarketplace. And on top of that, we are adding the layer for the credit card. So, we\ncontinue gaining share with credit products, all of the volume in the marketplace, and that's\nwhere it becomes more and more profitable. I'd say those are the most relevant impacts.\nIn terms of ramping, we'll continue increasing the cards we issue. We'll continue\nincreasing the lines, and so on, we are comfortable how this is working.\nMartin de los Santos\nHi, it's Martin here. Regarding NIMAL spreads, we don't disclose specific spreads by\ncountry or product, but I can give you directionally, consumer credits and personal loans\nhave the highest NIMAL margins throughout, followed by merchant credits, which has also\na relatively high margin. In both of those products, as we move up market, we expect to\nreach users with lower risks with whom we charge lower interest rates, and they will result\nin lower…smaller spreads. But it will be incremental volume, as Osvaldo was mentioning\nbefore. Credit card itself as it is ramping up, and remember, the credit card, it takes\nseveral months, a few months to reach profitability. So, as we are scaling, the NIMAL\nspread of the credit card is neutral or marginally negative, but we have seen the older\ncohorts becoming positive already. So, we are confident that as we continue to increase\nour portfolio and clean the other cohorts, we will reach profitability at a portfolio level.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Neha Agarwala from HSBC. Please go ahead. Hi, Neha,\nis your line muted?\nNeha Agarwala\nHi, can you hear me?\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n10\nMartin de los Santos\nHello, yes, we can. Yes, we can. Go ahead please.\nNeha Agarwala\nOkay. Perfect. Sorry. Zooming in again on the credit cards. Could you just give us a\nbreakdown as to the usage of credit cards on platform and off platform roughly, both in\nBrazil and Mexico? And also, any sense of what percentage of your credit card portfolio is\nin Brazil versus Mexico? My other question is on the software business. You mentioned\nthat in Brazil in the acquiring space, you are…you launched software to increase the\nmonetization of the acquiring business? How…the software business is in-house? Are\nyou building software in-house or are you working with software providers and attaching it\nwith your POS to make the usage seamless for the merchants? And what is the ambition\nthere? If you could elaborate a bit more on that? Would it be organic, M&A partnership?\nThank you, so much.\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nSo, Neha, the first part of the question was related to credit card use between the\nmarketplace and off platform. I would say that, in general, the majority of the volume we\ndo, both in Brazil and in Mexico, is off platform. I would say over 60% of the volume we do\nin both countries is off platform. Even though we do the extra incentives for people to use\nthe card on platform, we believe it's great because they show that they're not just using the\ncard for those incentives, but that we are gaining principality. And in many cases, this is\nthe card that gets a top of wallet, and gets used more and more frequently.\nMartin de los Santos\nWith regard to software, I think it's, as you mentioned it's an important part of the strategy\nof our acquiring business, we are making good advances in that front. We mentioned\nsome of those in the letter, but for the most part, it will be internal developers. Typically,\nare not…we have not been very acquisitive in terms of buying other companies. So most\nlikely will be on development.\nCompany Representative\nLet me complement that, Martin. Thank you. I will say that…two things. On the one\nhand, there are many things we want to develop. We have started with catalog, the ability\nto invoice and also to keep stocks and then I think that we will develop related to basically\nto become really the neural system of small and medium stores. There are many things\nthat we need to do to be able to achieve that, but we are starting to see good results in\nterms of engagement and driving higher use of Mercado Pago, in particular with SMBs\nwhere they usually have several MPOs in front of them. Also, with regards to acquiring,\nwe have seen some…I think that this is typically very complex because you really need to\nintegrate it with all of the payment system, and we have seen other companies struggle\nwith this in the past. So, it's a likely…it's always something we look into, but we usually\nprefer to develop it ourselves.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Robert Ford from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ford\nHi, Martin, Ariel, Osvaldo. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about\nthe rate of adoption of Melimise in Brazil and Mexico? And more specifically, how\nbehavior patterns change following subscription on the marketplace and also across other\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n11\nverticals and are there any early indications of incremental principality? And then how is\nMelimise impacting Blue funding as well? Thank you so much.\nMartin de los Santos\nHi, Bob. How are you? Martin. As you know, we did…we implemented a change in our\nloyalty program this quarter, where we opened 2 tiers of the program: one priced at $2,\nwhich included all the benefits of free shipping that we traditionally had, including also now\nthe fintech benefits of cashbacks, both on the marketplace as well as when you use the\ncredit card outside of MercadoLibre. And then we have the other…the traditional one,\nwhich is called Melimise total, which includes all the benefits plus the content from this\nMeli.\nWe don't disclose specific numbers on the loyalty program, but we have seen very positive\nadoptions. We have the new program, the one that, the lower-priced one. We have seen\na lot of users engaging with that loyalty program. And then the effects of people enrolling\ninto a program are similar to what we have seen in the past. We've seen more users,\nmore better conversion, better engagement with our platform. So, it's all very beneficial to\nus. We're very excited about the relaunch of a program, but it's still too early to share our\nactual numbers on that.\nAnd then you refer to the Blue money. As you know, we're giving cash back on purchases\nof MercadoLibre as well as purchases done with the Mercado Pago credit card. Those\ncashbacks are done on mainly dollar. It's still too early. I mean we've seen users\naccumulating those balances. They are accumulating more than spending it. So actually,\nbalance on their accounts is increasing, but there's nothing really to report so far. It's too\nearly.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Joao Soares from Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoao Soares\nThank you. Two questions on my side. The first one, I just wanted to hear your thoughts.\nI mean we're looking to Brazil, the credit environment, right? It seems like October had a\nslight uptick in households with outstanding debt, right? So, it seems like there's some…of\ncourse, with the interest rates increasing, right, the components increase in interest rates\nhere in Brazil to 11.25%. So, it seems like you're very confident in growing keep the\norigination at this pace, right? But how are you thinking about the macro? Could it impact\nsomehow, right? And just going back to the question about Brazil and Mexico. I just\nstill…I didn't understand how much is Mexico growing versus Brazil? If you could please\nclarify. Thank you.\nMartin de los Santos\nHi. Yes. It's Martin here. Yes. It's correct. We'll be seeing this increase in interest rate in\nBrazil. We have seen it in different countries where we operate. But the reality is when\nwe look at our credit business, much more important than one or two points of increase in\ninterest rate or the cost of funding is an ability to predict defaults. Now, that's the biggest\npart of the cost structure of our products. Again, once again, we are accelerating because\nwe feel very confident about the improvements that we have made on models, and we're\nreaching new segments of the population that are lower risk. So I think macro, overall, it\ndoes not affect this product as much as we are able to predict bad debt.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n12\nCompany Representative\nAnd on the second part of the question, we don't disclose its precise numbers by country.\nWhat I was referring to is that if you compare the first year or the first quarter of Mexico to\nthe first ones in Brazil, we are issuing cards in Mexico at a significantly faster rate than we\ndid in Brazil, basically because we have had more prior experience building credit card\nmodels.\nOperator\nAgain, if you have a question, please press \"*\" then \"1.\" And our next question comes\nfrom Josh Beck from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJosh Beck\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the fulfillment center\nambitions. You obviously said it, I think five in Brazil and one in Mexico. Is this a multiyear\ninvestment cycle. And then I'm also curious, as you have a higher density of fulfillment\ncenters that's maybe a little bit more hub and spoke. What type of benefits are you seeing\nin terms of cost to serve and ability to do shorter delivery windows?\nAriel Szarfsztejn\nHey, Josh, Ariel here. So, to the first part of your question, there is no new multiyear cycle\nor change in ambitions. We've been always saying that we are…we pretend to continue\nbuilding the capacity that we need in order to make sure we can deal with the growth in\ndemand that we are forecasting for MercadoLibre. The growth in penetration that we'll\nhave in Brazil and other countries and normalizing the capacity required to operate in\nMexico after a few years in which we were running super tight. So, no new direction, no\nchanges in terms of investment cycles, just reality on what we think we need to continue\ngaining market share as we have been doing over the last few years.\nTo the second part of your question, there is definitely an angle in terms of geographic\nexpansion. We are not only building warehouses in the main capitals of the countries as\nwe have announced. We are also regionalizing our capacity more and that means that\nwe'll be better equipped to serve our customers with faster delivery promises and hence,\nbetter hopefully, retention rates coming from them. Different profiles of warehouses have\ndifferent unit economics. I think we have never gone that deep into disclosure, and we'll\nprobably do not do so in the future. But as I was saying before, the story and the type of\nunit economics and investment modes that we're thinking are not changing from what we\nwere thinking in the past. This is the type of investments that we need to continue growing\nand serving our users.\nMartin de los Santos\nAnd let me just to complement from a cash flow perspective, these are investments that\nare business as usual. If you look at the CAPEX during this quarter in which we opened\nsix fulfillment centers, our logistics was $120 million, which was more than last quarter, of\ncourse, but as a percentage of revenue is relatively stable compared to the past several\nquarters. So, it's something that it's not an investment cycle. It's not…obviously, this\nquarter, we opened more fulfillment centers than the past couple of quarters, but this is\nbusiness as usual as Ariel mentioned.\nOperator\nOur next question is a follow-up from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n13\nGeoffrey Elliott\nHello. Thanks very much for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to get some explanation\non one point, that there's a note that G&A expenses rose 1.1 percentage points year-on-\nyear, of which 0.8 percentage points due to a non-recurring expense that relates to certain\ncustomer refunds for prior periods. What happened there? Why refund customers for\nprior periods?\nMartin de los Santos\nHi. It's Martin here. Yes, as you mentioned, there was a 1.1 compression on the margin\nbecause of G&A. Most of that is related to a non-recurring expense this quarter, which is a\nrefund to fintech users for the past several years back. What happened this quarter, we\nmade a change to our consumers and merchant credit products in Brazil, but from now on,\nwhen a user pays an installment a few days before the actual due date, we'll be refunding\nthem the base which…the advancements, sorry, in terms of the days that they prepay.\nSo, even if it's a few cents, we will refund them for that installment.\nSo, since we are already doing that going forward, we decided to go back in time and\nrefund our users for the past several years. And those are refunds that are very small on\naverage $4 per user, $0.40 per actual installment paid in advance those are few days, but\nwe felt that it was the right thing to do to make it to…to make it up for them. Since then,\nwe are not making a change going forward. So, this is a one-off that we registered this\nquarter. That's it.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Rodrigo Gastim from IBBA. Please go ahead.\nRodrigo Gastim\nYes. Thank you, guys. Just two questions here on the loyalty program. First, if you're\nseeing any kind of margin pressure coming from the loyalty program given that you just\nramped [ph] the program this quarter, so any margin pressure on this front, how much\nyou're investing on that? That's the first point. And the second one, what are the main\nunit economics difference between the essential plan, the total plan that we just launched?\nSo, just curious here to understand how you see that? What are the main KPIs and the\ndifference in terms of unit economics? That's it. Thank you, guys.\nMartin des los Santos\nHi. It's Martin here. I think your question is related to margin…potential margin pressures\nbecause of the loyalty program. First of all, we…all the benefits that I was mentioning\nbefore, the Fintech-related benefits and the cashbacks, we started in this quarter, so it's\nstill ramping up. The way we are investing that is we're relocating marketing dollars to the\nloyalty program. So, we don't expect that to generate significant margin pressure. But\nalso keep in mind that expectation of the loyalty program is to bring incremental volumes\nthat should compensate that whatever investment we make on the program.\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nSo just to complement on unit economics, while we don't disclose the whole details on our\nprogram. Bear in mind that in the total subscription, we need to pay Disney for a big chunk\nof what we collect as part of our agreement with the subscription for content, while in our\nessential subscription, we are basically giving our users the same type of benefits within\nour ecosystem, but we don't have to pay content. So, basically, the revenues we get from\nthe subscription do help us sustain or pay for the benefits that we are providing our users.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n14\nOperator\nAnd the next question is a follow-up from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go\nahead.\nJamie Friedman\nHi. I was just hoping you could elaborate or share some observations about Argentina on\nthe marketplace side. I see in here that in the presentation you described it as Argentina\nimproving significantly being driven by growth initiatives and consumption trends. But\ncould you elaborate further what's the market environment looking like in Argentina?\nThank you.\nAriel Szarfsztejn\nHey, Jamie. Ariel here. So, yes, as we mentioned in the presentation, we see an\nimprovement in the growth rate and the health of our business in Argentina. It's…on the\none hand, there is an improvement in general consumer behavior and the macro scenario\nthat definitely play a role for us in terms of a tailwind to expand our business. But also,\nthere is something around our own performance, right? So, we continue to roll out\nexperience improvement, assortment, improvement, removing frictions from our users.\nWe've also taken measures to help our buyers and sellers while taking care and\npreserving our P&L to boost frequency and drive conversion rates like installment,\nshipping prices, etc.\nBut in general, we remain very, very optimistic what we are seeing in the country.\nDemand is performing well, and we are satisfied with the turnaround that we saw over the\nlast few months.\nOsvaldo Gimenez\nYes. Just to complement that, on the fintech side of the business, we're also seeing very\ngood traction in Argentina, with interest rates coming down, and NPLs under control and\nvery good spreads on our credit product. We also accelerated credit this quarter in\nArgentina. So, very positive signs as well from the fintech side.\nOperator\nThere are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer\nsession. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Martin de los Santos for any closing\nremarks.\nCONCLUSION\nMartin des los Santos\nThanks, everybody, for joining the call tonight. We had another quarter of strong results\nand great growth throughout our business. As we mentioned, we invested during this\nquarter on credits, which is strategic for Mercado Pago as well as logistics, which is critical\nto continue bringing volume on line. Meli is very well positioned to capture all the\ninvestments or the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us, and we are investing\nbehind those with discipline, focusing on long term and sustainable profitable growth.\nMercadoLibre, Inc.\nWednesday, November 06, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n15\nLet me take a minute now to remember Mario Vasquez, who passed away a couple of\nmonths ago. He was a board member for MercadoLibre for 17 years. He left a very\nstrong mark on all of us, all of us who had a chance to work with him for those years. So,\nwe are going to miss him. And now I close the call, and thank you again for joining.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
