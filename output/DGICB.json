Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Donegal Group Inc.\n\n“With the exit from commercial lines markets in Georgia and Alabama essentially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2024, solid new business writings, rate achievement and retention levels led to a 6.4% increase in commercial lines net premiums written for the third quarter of 2024. Our personal lines net premiums written growth rate for the third quarter was 5.4%, primarily attributable to strong rate increases and policy retention that were partially offset by intentional strategic actions to slow growth and further improve profitability.\n\n“Despite higher-than-average weather-related losses during the quarter, primarily attributable to Hurricane Helene in late September, our combined ratio improved significantly to 96.4%, compared to 104.5% for the prior-year quarter. Our core loss ratios improved across all of our major lines of business. We attribute that improvement to the favorable impact of numerous ongoing underwriting initiatives and higher net premiums earned from renewal rate increases that we implemented over the past two years.”\n\nMr, Burke concluded, “We have growing confidence that the continuing execution of our strategies will deliver sustained excellent financial performance.”\n\n**Insurance Operations**\n\n _Donegal Group is an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiaries and affiliates offer property and casualty lines of insurance in three Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania), five Southern states (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia), eight Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) and five Southwestern states (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Utah). Donegal Mutual Insurance Company and the insurance subsidiaries of Donegal Group conduct business together as the Donegal Insurance Group._\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n(dollars in thousands)  \n**Net Premiums Earned**  \nCommercial lines| $| 136,401| $| 135,432| 0.7| %| $| 402,982| $| 399,427| 0.9| %  \nPersonal lines| 101,556| 88,961| 14.2| 297,035| 256,460| 15.8  \nTotal net premiums earned| $| 237,957| $| 224,393| 6.0| %| $| 700,017| $| 655,887| 6.7| %  \n**Net Premiums Written**  \nCommercial lines:  \nAutomobile| $| 41,464| $| 37,535| 10.5| %| $| 142,067| $| 134,853| 5.3| %  \nWorkers' compensation| 23,934| 24,371| -1.8| 82,599| 85,315| -3.2  \nCommercial multi-peril| 50,155| 44,949| 11.6| 163,528| 147,622| 10.8  \nOther| 10,548| 11,639| -9.4| 35,649| 39,913| -10.7  \nTotal commercial lines| 126,101| 118,494| 6.4| 423,843| 407,703| 4.0  \nPersonal lines:  \nAutomobile| 65,150| 58,038| 12.3| 188,958| 161,348| 17.1  \nHomeowners| 38,288| 39,633| -3.4| 109,655| 105,035| 4.4  \nOther| 2,669| 3,021| -11.7| 8,383| 8,917| -6.0  \nTotal personal lines| 106,107| 100,692| 5.4| 306,996| 275,300| 11.5  \nTotal net premiums written| $| 232,208| $| 219,186| 5.9| %| $| 730,839| $| 683,003| 7.0| %  \n  \n_Net Premiums Written_\n\nThe 5.9% increase in net premiums written for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, as shown in the table above, represents the combination of 6.4% growth in commercial lines net premiums written and 5.4% growth in personal lines net premiums written. The $13.0 million increase in net premiums written for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 included:\n\n  * _Commercial Lines:_ $7.6 million increase that we attribute primarily to new business writings, strong premium retention, and a continuation of renewal premium increases in lines other than workers’ compensation, offset partially by planned attrition in states in which we are executing ongoing profit improvement initiatives as part of our state-specific strategies.\n\n  * _Personal Lines:_ $5.4 million increase that we attribute primarily to a continuation of renewal premium rate increases and strong policy retention, offset partially by planned attrition due to non-renewal actions.\n\n\n\n\n_Underwriting Performance_\n\nWe evaluate the performance of our commercial lines and personal lines segments primarily based upon the underwriting results of our insurance subsidiaries as determined under statutory accounting practices. The following table presents comparative details with respect to the GAAP and statutory combined ratios1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30****,**| **September 30****,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**GAAP Combined Ratios (Total Lines)**  \nLoss ratio - core losses| 50.1| %| 56.7| %| 54.5| %| 56.0| %  \nLoss ratio - weather-related losses| 10.3| 11.5| 8.6| 9.1  \nLoss ratio - large fire losses| 3.7| 4.9| 5.2| 5.3  \nLoss ratio - net prior-year reserve development| -2.6| -3.3| -2.2| -2.4  \nLoss ratio| 61.5| 69.8| 66.1| 68.0  \nExpense ratio| 34.5| 34.1| 34.0| 34.9  \nDividend ratio| 0.4| 0.6| 0.5| 0.6  \nCombined ratio| 96.4| %| 104.5| %| 100.6| %| 103.5| %  \n**Statutory Combined Ratios**  \nCommercial lines:  \nAutomobile| 101.5| %| 86.5| %| 98.2| %| 94.8| %  \nWorkers' compensation| 84.7| 97.7| 104.1| 93.1  \nCommercial multi-peril| 88.4| 114.8| 100.4| 113.8  \nOther| 59.4| 76.2| 78.4| 82.7  \nTotal commercial lines| 89.8| 97.5| 98.6| 100.2  \nPersonal lines:  \nAutomobile| 97.8| 109.8| 97.8| 106.1  \nHomeowners| 116.8| 128.9| 107.5| 111.2  \nOther| 102.2| 46.4| 97.2| 81.3  \nTotal personal lines| 104.7| 119.4| 101.2| 107.2  \nTotal lines| 96.0| %| 105.2| %| 99.7| %| 102.9| %  \n  \n_Loss Ratio_\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the loss ratio decreased to 61.5%, compared to 69.8% for the third quarter of 2023. For the commercial lines segment, the core loss ratio of 48.5% for the third quarter of 2024 decreased from 53.7% for the third quarter of 2023, due largely to lower severity of large casualty losses. For the personal lines segment, the core loss ratio of 52.5% for the third quarter of 2024 decreased from 61.8% for the third quarter of 2023, due largely to the favorable impact of premium rate increases on net premiums earned for that segment. Core loss ratios in both segments improved compared to the respective ratios for the first half of 2024.\n\nWeather-related losses were $24.4 million, or 10.3 percentage points of the loss ratio, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.7 million, or 11.5 percentage points of the loss ratio, for the third quarter of 2023. Weather-related loss activity for the third quarter of 2024 was higher than our previous five-year average of $18.8 million, or 9.4 percentage points of the loss ratio, for third-quarter weather-related losses. Our insurance subsidiaries incurred $6.0 million in net losses from Hurricane Helene in September 2024.\n\nLarge fire losses, which we define as individual fire losses in excess of $50,000, for the third quarter of 2024 were $8.8 million, or 3.7 percentage points of the loss ratio. That amount was lower than large fire losses of $11.0 million, or 4.9 percentage points of the loss ratio, for the third quarter of 2023. We experienced a decrease in commercial property fire losses compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nNet favorable development of reserves for losses incurred in prior accident years of $6.2 million decreased the loss ratio for the third quarter of 2024 by 2.6 percentage points, compared to $7.3 million that decreased the loss ratio for the third quarter of 2023 by 3.3 percentage points. Our insurance subsidiaries experienced favorable development primarily in the commercial multi-peril and other commercial lines of business.\n\n_Expense Ratio_\n\nThe expense ratio was 34.5% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 34.1% for the third quarter of 2023. The modest increase in the expense ratio primarily reflected an increase in underwriting-based incentive costs as well as higher technology systems-related expenses that were primarily due to increased costs related to our ongoing systems modernization project, a portion of which Donegal Mutual Insurance Company allocates to our insurance subsidiaries. This increase was offset partially by impacts of various expense reduction initiatives, including agency incentive program revisions, commission schedule adjustments, targeted staffing reductions, and hiring restrictions for open employment positions, among others. We expect the impact from allocated costs from Donegal Mutual Insurance Company to our insurance subsidiaries related to the ongoing systems modernization project will peak at approximately 1.3 percentage points of the expense ratio for the full year of 2024 before beginning to subside gradually in subsequent years.\n\n**Investment Operations**\n\n _Donegal Group’s investment strategy is to generate an appropriate amount of after-tax income on its invested assets while minimizing credit risk through investment in high-quality securities. As a result, we had invested 96.2% of our consolidated investment portfolio in diversified, highly rated and marketable fixed-maturity securities at September 30, 2024._\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Amount**| **%**| **Amount**| **%**  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nFixed maturities, at carrying value:  \nU.S.Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies| $| 173,663| 12.7| %| $| 176,991| 13.3| %  \nObligations of states and political subdivisions| 413,040| 30.1| 415,280| 31.3  \nCorporate securities| 427,372| 31.2| 399,640| 30.1  \nMortgage-backed securities| 304,911| 22.3| 278,260| 21.0  \nAllowance for expected credit losses| (1,483| )| -0.1| (1,326| )| -0.1  \nTotal fixed maturities| 1,317,503| 96.2| 1,268,845| 95.6  \nEquity securities, at fair value| 35,957| 2.6| 25,903| 2.0  \nShort-term investments, at cost| 15,805| 1.2| 32,306| 2.4  \nTotal investments| $| 1,369,265| 100.0| %| $| 1,327,054| 100.0| %  \nAverage investment yield| 3.3| %| 3.1| %  \nAverage tax-equivalent investment yield| 3.3| %| 3.2| %  \nAverage fixed-maturity duration (years)| 5.1| 4.3  \n  \nNet investment income of $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased modestly compared to $10.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net investment income primarily reflected an increase in average investment yield relative to the prior-year third quarter.\n\nNet investment gains of $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 were primarily related to unrealized gains in the fair value of equity securities held at September 30, 2024. Net investment losses of $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 were primarily related to unrealized losses in the fair value of equity securities held at September 30, 2023.\n\nOur book value per share was $15.22 at September 30, 2024, compared to $14.39 at December 31, 2023, with the increase related to net income as well as $11.9 million of after-tax unrealized gains within our available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio during 2024 that increased our book value by $0.37 per share, offset partially by cash dividends declared.\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial** **Measures**\n\n _We prepare our consolidated financial statements on the basis of GAAP. Our insurance subsidiaries also prepare financial statements based on statutory accounting principles state insurance regulators prescribe or permit (“SAP”). In addition to using GAAP-based performance measurements, we also utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide value in managing our business and for comparison to the financial results of our peers. These non-GAAP measures are net premiums written, operating income or loss and statutory combined ratio._\n\nNet premiums written and operating income or loss are non-GAAP financial measures investors in insurance companies commonly use. We define net premiums written as the amount of full-term premiums our insurance subsidiaries record for policies effective within a given period less premiums our insurance subsidiaries cede to reinsurers. We define operating income or loss as net income or loss excluding after-tax net investment gains or losses, after-tax restructuring charges and other significant non-recurring items. Because our calculation of operating income or loss may differ from similar measures other companies use, investors should exercise caution when comparing our measure of operating income or loss to the measure of other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net premiums earned to net premiums written for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n(dollars in thousands)  \n**Reconciliation of Net Premiums**  \n**Earned to Net Premiums Written**  \nNet premiums earned| $| 237,957| $| 224,393| 6.0| %| $| 700,017| $| 655,886| 6.7| %  \nChange in net unearned premiums| (5,749| )| (5,207| )| 10.4| 30,822| 27,117| 13.7  \nNet premiums written| $| 232,208| $| 219,186| 5.9| %| $| 730,839| $| 683,003| 7.0| %  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss)**  \n**to Non-GAAP Operating Income**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 16,752| $| (805| )| NM| $| 26,860| $| 6,396| 319.9| %  \nInvestment (gains) losses (after tax)| (1,482| )| 981| NM| (3,733| )| (735| )| 407.9  \nNon-GAAP operating income| $| 15,270| $| 176| NM| $| 23,127| $| 5,661| 308.5| %  \n**Per Share Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss)**  \n**to Non-GAAP Operating Income**  \nNet income (loss) – Class A (diluted)| $| 0.51| $| (0.02| )| NM| $| 0.81| $| 0.20| 305.0| %  \nInvestment (gains) losses (after tax)| (0.05| )| 0.03| NM| (0.11| )| (0.03| )| 266.7  \nNon-GAAP operating income – Class A| $| 0.46| $| 0.01| NM| $| 0.70| $| 0.17| 311.8| %  \nNet income (loss) – Class B| $| 0.46| $| (0.02| )| NM| $| 0.74| $| 0.17| 335.3| %  \nInvestment (gains) losses (after tax)| (0.04| )| 0.02| NM| (0.11| )| (0.02| )| 450.0  \nNon-GAAP operating income – Class B| $| 0.42| $| -| NM| $| 0.63| $| 0.15| 320.0| %  \n  \nThe statutory combined ratio is a non-GAAP standard measurement of underwriting profitability that is based upon amounts determined under SAP.
