Scruggs, President and Chief Commercial Officer of RedHill Biopharma, Inc**. \"The continuing access to Talicia further reflects the strength of our collaboration and aligned commitment to improving patient care. This agreement comes in the wake of the publication of the new American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Clinical Guideline for _H. pylori_ infection, listing Talicia as an empirically prescribed first-line option – a clear scientific validation of Talicia's effective, simple and convenient all-in-one three-times daily (TID) therapeutic approach, supporting high rates of _H. pylori_ eradication without the need for prior resistance testing.\"\n\n**About _H. pylori_** _H. pylori_ is a bacterial infection that affects approximately 35%6 of the U.S. population, with an estimated two million patients treated annually3. Worldwide, around 66% of the population has _H. pylori_ infection7, which is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Group 1 carcinogen. It remains the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer8 and a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease9 and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma10. More than 27,000 Americans are diagnosed with gastric cancer annually11. Eradication of _H. pylori_ is becoming increasingly difficult, with current therapies failing in approximately 25-40% of patients who remain  _H. pylori_ -positive due to high resistance of  _H. pylori_ to antibiotics – especially clarithromycin – which is still commonly used in standard combination therapies12.\n\n**About Talicia ® **Talicia® is the only low-dose rifabutin-based therapy approved for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infection and is designed to address the high resistance of _H. pylori_ bacteria seen with other antibiotics. More specifically, the high rates of _H. pylori_ resistance to clarithromycin have led to significant increases in treatment failures with clarithromycin-based therapies and are a strong public health concern, as highlighted by the ACG, FDA and the WHO in recent years.\n\nTalicia® is a novel, fixed-dose, all-in-one oral capsule combination of two antibiotics (amoxicillin and rifabutin) and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole). In November 2019, Talicia® was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infection in adults. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, Talicia® demonstrated 84% eradication of _H. pylori_ infection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) group vs. 58% in the active comparator arm (p<0.0001). Minimal to zero resistance to rifabutin, a key component of Talicia®, was detected in RedHill's pivotal Phase 3 study. Further, in an analysis of data from this study, it was observed that subjects who were confirmed adherent13 to their therapy had response rates of 90.3% in the Talicia® arm vs. 64.7% in the active comparator arm14. Talicia® is eligible for a total of eight years of U.S. market exclusivity under its Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and is also covered by U.S. patents which extend patent protection until 2034 with additional patents and applications pending and granted in various territories worldwide.\n\n**TALICIA: INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION** Talicia is a three-drug combination of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial, and rifabutin, a rifamycin antibacterial­­, indicated for the treatment of  _Helicobacter pylori_ infection in adults. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Talicia and other antibacterial drugs, Talicia should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION** Talicia contains omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and rifabutin, a rifamycin antibacterial. It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of these medications, any other components of the formulation, any other beta-lactams or any other rifamycin.Talicia is contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products.Talicia is contraindicated in patients receiving delavirdine or voriconazole.Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with omeprazole, amoxicillin and rifabutin.Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with use of amoxicillin, a component of Talicia.Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) have been reported with rifabutin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole. Additionally, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with rifabutin.Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs and penicillins.Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.Talicia may cause fetal harm. Talicia is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Talicia may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. An additional non-hormonal method of contraception is recommended when taking Talicia.Talicia should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment.Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs. These events have occurred as both new onset and exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease.The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) were diarrhea, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, chromaturia, rash, dyspepsia, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact RedHill Biopharma INC. at 1-833-ADRHILL (1-833-237-4455) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.fda.gov/medwatch).Full prescribing information for Talicia is available at [www.Talicia.com](http://bit.ly/2CozHNH).\n\n**About RedHill Biopharma** RedHill Biopharma Ltd.

This is a very interesting addition to the already strong patent portfolio protecting opaganib.\"\n\n**About Opaganib (ABC294640)** Opaganib, a proprietary investigational host-directed and potentially broad-acting drug, is a first-in-class, orally administered sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, targeting multiple potential indications, including several cancers, diabetes and obesity-related disorders, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), Sulfur Mustard exposure, COVID-19, Ebola and other viruses as part of pandemic preparedness.\n\nOpaganib's host-directed action is thought to work through the inhibition of multiple pathways, the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and disruption of viral replication, through simultaneous inhibition of three sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in human cells (SPHK2, DES1 and GCS).\n\nSeveral U.S. government countermeasures and pandemic preparedness programs have selected opaganib for evaluation for multiple indications, including Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), Ebola virus disease and others Funding bodies include the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP), led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. government Department of Health & Human Services' National Institutes of Health and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response's (ASPR) Center for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\nOpaganib has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, multiple variants, and several other viruses, such as Influenza A and Ebola. Opaganib delivered a statistically significant increase in survival time when given at 150 mg/kg twice a day (BID) in a United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) _in vivo_ Ebola virus study, making it the first host-directed molecule to show activity in Ebola virus disease. Opaganib also recently demonstrated a distinct synergistic effect when combined individually with remdesivir (Veklury®, Gilead Sciences Inc.), significantly improving potency while maintaining cell viability, in a U.S. Army-funded and conducted _in vitro_ Ebola virus study.\n\nBeing host-targeted, and based on data accumulated to date, opaganib is expected to maintain effect against emerging viral variants. In prespecified analyses of Phase 2/3 clinical data in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, oral opaganib demonstrated improved viral RNA clearance, faster time to recovery and significant mortality reduction in key patient subpopulations versus placebo on top of standard of care. Opaganib has demonstrated its safety and tolerability profile in more than 470 people in multiple clinical studies and expanded access use. Data from the opaganib global Phase 2/3 study was published in [Microorganisms](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/9/1767).\n\nOpaganib has received several orphan-drug designations from the FDA in oncology and other diseases and has undergone studies in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (Phase 2a) and prostate cancer. Opaganib also has a Phase 1 chemoradiotherapy study protocol ready for FDA-IND submission.\n\nOpaganib has also shown positive preclinical results in renal fibrosis, and has the potential to target multiple oncology, radioprotection, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.\n\n**About RedHill Biopharma** RedHill Biopharma Ltd.

(Nasdaq: RDHL) (\"RedHill\" or the \"Company\"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced the signing of a collaborative research agreement with Duke University School of Medicine outlining plans for multiple in vivo studies. The program is designed to test opaganib[2] as a potential medical countermeasure to treat phosgene inhalation injury, aimed at providing results sufficient to advance opaganib into further definitive U.S. government-sponsored development under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule pathway to approval. The FDA Animal Rule allows for the use of pivotal animal model efficacy studies to support FDA approval of new drugs when human clinical trials are not ethical or feasible. Under this research agreement, RedHill will provide required drug quantities for animal studies, analytical support to quantify drug concentrations in plasma samples, and share dosing regimen with the Achanta Lab at Duke University.\n\n![RedHill Biopharma Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1334141/RedHill_Biopharma_Logo.jpg)\n\n\"Opaganib is currently being tested, by various governmental research bodies, in multiple areas that urgently require new chemical and medical countermeasure therapeutic options,\" **said Dr. Satya Achanta, D.V.M., Ph.D., Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine.** \"Our research will help determine whether there is a potential protective role of opaganib in limiting damage caused by phosgene inhalation.\"\n\n\"Notably used as a chemical weapon during World War I, phosgene, a toxic, colorless chemical, is today widely used in industrial processes for the manufacture of plastics and pesticides. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified 123 sites in the United States that could expose millions of people to phosgene potentially due to plant malfunction or bioterrorism,\" **said****Gilead Raday, RedHill's Chief Operating Officer and Head of Research and Development**. \"This exciting collaboration with Duke University School of Medicine could pave the way to a potential therapy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phosgene inhalation can cause, which can be extremely dangerous, causing significant, even fatal, injury. No known approved antidote or reversal agent currently exists, and, if approved, opaganib may provide potential for stockpiling for emergency use in the event of a major public safety incident.\"\n\n**What is Phosgene inhalation injury**\n\nPhosgene inhalation injury occurs when someone breathes in phosgene gas (COCl₂), a toxic chemical primarily used in industrial processes. Phosgene has a distinct odor, similar to freshly mown grass or hay. However, only 10% of the population may detect this odor at lower concentrations. The combination of its unassuming odor and poor human detection makes phosgene particularly dangerous. At higher concentrations, it is extremely dangerous, even fatal, and is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that no antidotes or reversal agents exist at this time. Phosgene was notably used as a chemical weapon during World War I.\n\nToday, phosgene use in industry is ubiquitous - being used in the production of polymers, plastics and pesticides. Global estimates indicate that more than 12 million metric tons are produced annually[3]. Despite its widespread use, some regions poorly regulate its production, and concern exists for its potential as a weapon of bioterrorism. Given its severe toxicity and high mortality, research is primarily limited to an Animal Rule pathway to approval, which allows for the use of pivotal animal model efficacy studies to support FDA approval of new drugs when human clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.\n\nThe EPA identified 123 sites in the United States that could expose millions of people to phosgene if the plant malfunctions or becomes a target of bioterrorism.\n\n**About Opaganib (ABC294640)**\n\nOpaganib, a proprietary investigational host-directed and potentially broad-acting drug, is a first-in-class, orally administered sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, targeting multiple potential indications, including several cancers, diabetes and obesity-related disorders, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), Sulfur Mustard exposure, COVID-19, Ebola and other viruses as part of pandemic preparedness.\n\nOpaganib's host-directed action is thought to work through the inhibition of multiple pathways, the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and disruption of viral replication, through simultaneous inhibition of three sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in human cells (SPHK2, DES1 and GCS).\n\nSeveral U.S. government countermeasures and pandemic preparedness programs have selected opaganib for evaluation for multiple indications, including Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), Ebola virus disease and others Funding bodies include the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP), led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. government Department of Health & Human Services' National Institutes of Health and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response's (ASPR) Center for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\nOpaganib has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, multiple variants, and several other viruses, such as Influenza A and Ebola. Opaganib delivered a statistically significant increase in survival time when given at 150 mg/kg twice a day (BID) in a United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) _in vivo_ Ebola virus study, making it the first host-directed molecule to show activity in Ebola virus disease. Opaganib also recently demonstrated a distinct synergistic effect when combined individually with remdesivir (Veklury®, Gilead Sciences Inc.), significantly improving potency while maintaining cell viability, in a U.S. Army-funded and conducted _in vitro_ Ebola virus study.\n\nBeing host-targeted, and based on data accumulated to date, opaganib is expected to maintain effect against emerging viral variants. In prespecified analyses of Phase 2/3 clinical data in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, oral opaganib demonstrated improved viral RNA clearance, faster time to recovery and significant mortality reduction in key patient subpopulations versus placebo on top of standard of care. Opaganib has demonstrated its safety and tolerability profile in more than 470 people in multiple clinical studies and expanded access use. Data from the opaganib global Phase 2/3 study was published in [Microorganisms](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/9/1767).\n\nOpaganib has received several orphan-drug designations from the FDA in oncology and other diseases and has undergone studies in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (Phase 2a) and prostate cancer. Opaganib also has a Phase 1 chemoradiotherapy study protocol ready for FDA-IND submission.\n\nOpaganib has also shown positive preclinical results in renal fibrosis, and has the potential to target multiple oncology, radioprotection, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.\n\n**About RedHill Biopharma**\n\nRedHill Biopharma Ltd.

Additional U.S. government collaborations with opaganib are ongoing_ _--__Significant geopolitical and logistical challenges exist in managing outbreaks of disease and there is an urgent need for safe and effective, oral, small molecule therapeutics that can be stored and easily distributed and administered in an outbreak_\n\nTEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (\"RedHill\" or the \"Company\"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a center of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), has selected opaganib2 for development to treat exposure to Ebola virus disease (EBOV).\n\n![RedHill Biopharma Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1334141/RedHill_Biopharma_Logo.jpg)\n\nUnder this cost-sharing contract, BARDA will provide partial funding for the company to further advance opaganib to mitigate infection and contain EBOV outbreaks. To date, opaganib has made positive development progress on the expected Animal Rule pathway towards potential approval as a treatment for EBOV. The Animal Rule allows for the use of pivotal animal model efficacy studies to support U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of new drugs when human clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.\n\n\"EBOV is deadly, killing, on average, half of all those who contract it. This year marks 10 years since the West Africa Ebola epidemic in which 11,000 people died, and yet there are still no host-directed, small molecule therapies approved to provide effective and useable treatment strategies,\" **said Guy Goldberg, RedHill's Chief Business Officer**. \"Currently only Inmazeb™, a combination of three monoclonal antibodies, and Ebanga™, a single monoclonal antibody, are FDA-approved to treat EBOV, as such there is an urgent medical need for additional effective and easy to distribute and administer EBOV therapies. There are also enormous geopolitical and logistical challenges to overcome in managing outbreaks such as EBOV, and others like Mpox, and so new host-directed, small molecule therapeutic options for biodefense and global health preparedness could prove to be major life-saving advances – this is especially true if they are capable of viral mutation-resistance, have extended shelf-lives for long-term storage, are relatively straightforward to transport to hard-to-reach territories, and are easy to administer without the need for cold-storage or injections.\"\n\nOpaganib delivered a statistically significant increase in survival time when given at 150 mg/kg twice a day (BID) in a United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) _in vivo_ EBOV study, making it the first host-directed molecule to show activity in EBOV. Opaganib also recently demonstrated a distinct synergistic effect when combined individually with remdesivir (Veklury®, Gilead Sciences Inc.), significantly improving potency while maintaining cell viability, in a U.S. Army-funded and conducted _in vitro_ EBOV study.\n\nOpaganib is currently also in development for multiple oncology, viral, inflammatory and diabetes and obesity-related indications, including COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and radiological and chemical protection or mitigation.\n\nThis project is supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number 75A50124C00059.\n\n**About Ebola virus disease:** According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ebola disease is a rare and often deadly illness, caused by infection by one of a group of four viruses, known as ebolaviruses. Transmission of the disease is mostly through contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman primate) or a sick or dead person infected with an ebolavirus. The course of the illness typically progresses from \"dry\" symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then progresses to \"wet\" symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting and unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising) as the person becomes sicker. Currently only Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a combination of three monoclonal antibodies and Ebanga™ (ansuvimab-zykl, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, LP), a single monoclonal antibody, are FDA-approved to treat EBOV. Both are intravenously administered direct acting monoclonal antibody antivirals that bind to glycoproteins on the Ebola virus's surface to prevent the virus from entering a person's cells. There is an urgent need for host-directed small molecule therapies that may be effective against multiple strains of ebolavirus, less likely to be impacted by viral mutation, and that are easy to store, distribute and administer, especially in areas where healthcare services and infrastructures may be sub-optimal. \n\n**About Opaganib (ABC294640)** Opaganib, a proprietary investigational host-directed and potentially broad-acting drug, is a first-in-class, orally administered sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, targeting multiple potential indications, including several cancers, diabetes and obesity-related disorders, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), Sulfur Mustard exposure, COVID-19, Ebola and other viruses as part of pandemic preparedness.\n\nOpaganib's host-directed action is thought to work through the inhibition of multiple pathways, the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and disruption of viral replication, through simultaneous inhibition of three sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in human cells (SPHK2, DES1 and GCS).\n\nOpaganib has been selected for evaluation by multiple NIH-funded U.S. government countermeasures programs: The Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP), led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the HHS National Institutes of Health, for the nuclear medical countermeasures (MCM) product development pipeline selected opaganib for development as a potential treatment for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). Opaganib will also be evaluated as a potential countermeasure for inhalational Sulfur Mustard exposure under a joint screening core operated by the BARDA Chemical Medical Countermeasures (Chem MCM) Program and the NIH/NIAID Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP).\n\nOpaganib has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, multiple variants, and several other viruses, such as Influenza A and Ebola.\n\nBeing host-targeted, and based on data accumulated to date, opaganib is expected to maintain effect against emerging viral variants. In prespecified analyses of Phase 2/3 clinical data in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, oral opaganib demonstrated improved viral RNA clearance, faster time to recovery and significant mortality reduction in key patient subpopulations versus placebo on top of standard of care. Opaganib has demonstrated its safety and tolerability profile in more than 470 people in multiple clinical studies and expanded access use. Data from the opaganib global Phase 2/3 study was published in [Microorganisms](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/9/1767).\n\nOpaganib has received several orphan-drug designations from the FDA in oncology and other diseases and has undergone studies in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (Phase 2a) and prostate cancer. Opaganib also has a Phase 1 chemoradiotherapy study protocol ready for FDA-IND submission.\n\nOpaganib has also shown positive preclinical results in renal fibrosis, and has the potential to target multiple oncology, radioprotection, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.\n\n**About RedHill Biopharma** RedHill Biopharma Ltd.

Talicia\nnet revenues were $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5.1 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023, mainly due to a 26% decrease in gross revenues and a 9% increase in Gross-to-Net deductions,\nmainly from increased Medicaid rebates. In the first half of 2024, $0.5 million of net revenues came from sales in the\nUAE. Talicia scripts in the U.S. in the first half of 2024 were down by approximately 12%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, mainly due to reduced promotion and marketing following employee terminations and other cost-\ncutting measures in the United States. These measures had a significant positive impact on reducing expenses, as\ndetailed below.\nMovantik had negative net revenues of $0.9 million in the first half of 2024, compared to negative net revenues of\n$0.1 million in the first half of 2023, mainly due to returns related to sales in the second and third quarters of 2020.\nGross Profit for the first half of 2024 was $1.2 million, compared to $3 million for the first half of 2023, in line with\nthe decrease in Net Revenues as explained above and primarily attributable to the reduction in Talicia prescriptions\nfollowing employee terminations and other cost-cutting measures.\nResearch and Development Expenses for the first half of 2024 were $0.7 million, as compared to $2.3 million for\nthe first half of 2023. The decrease is mainly attributable to the costs from closing the RHB-204 clinical trial, which\nwere recognized in the first half of 2023, and to ongoing cost-reduction measures.\nSelling, Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses for the first half of 2024 were $9 million,\ncompared to $19 million for the first half of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to downsizing the U.S. workforce\nfollowing the Movantik divestiture, leading to lower payroll and related expenses, and reduced sales force expenses.\nOther Income – There was no other income for the first half of 2024, as compared to $43 million of other income\nfor the first half of 2023. The other income recognized in the first half of 2023 was comprised of (i) $35.5 million\nfrom the divestiture of Movantik and (ii) $7.5 million from transitional services fees provided to the buyer of\nMovantik.\nOperating Loss for the first half of 2024 was $8.4 million, compared to operating income of $24.7 million for the\nfirst half of 2023. The difference is primarily attributable to the changes resulting from the divestiture of Movantik\nthe previous year, as detailed above. Excluding the other income from the Movantik transaction in 2023, the\noperating loss decreased by approximately $9.9 million, from an operating loss of $18.3 million for the first half of\n2023, reflecting the positive operating impact of the cost-cutting measures.\nFinancial Income, net for the first half of 2024 was $5.4 million, compared to $26.3 million for the first half of\n2023. In the first half of 2024, the income recognized was mainly attributable to warrants’ revaluation, offset by\nofferings’ expenses. In the first half of 2023, the income recognized was primarily attributable to a $20.6 million gain\nresulting from the extinguishment of the HCR Collateral Management LLC debt in exchange for the transfer of\nrights to Movantik.\nNet Loss was $3.1 million for the first half of 2024, compared to net income of $51 million for the first half of 2023.\nThis change was primarily attributable to the effects resulting from the sale of Movantik and ongoing cost-reduction\nmeasures, as detailed above. Excluding the other income and financial income from the Movantik transaction in\n2023, the net loss decreased by approximately $9.5 million, from a net loss of $12.6 million for the first half of 2023,\nreflecting the positive net impact of the cost-cutting measures.\n3\nTotal Assets as of June 30, 2024 were $22 million, as compared to $23 million as of December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the inventory balance due to sales, as well as a reduction in\nright-of-use assets, due to termination of car leases in the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nTotal Liabilities as of June 30, 2024 were $22 million, as compared to $21 million as of December 31, 2023. The\nincrease is mainly due to higher allowance from deductions from revenues and increased warrant-related derivative\nliabilities, partially offset by lower accounts payable, accrued expenses and lease liabilities (due to the car leases’\ntermination).\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $6.2 million, compared to\n$17.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to settling pre-closing\nliabilities associated with Movantik and other operational activities in the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nFurthermore, this reduction is attributable to the cost-cutting measures mentioned above.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $7.9 million, comprised\nprimarily of the net proceeds from securities offerings in the six months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months\nended June 30, 2023, Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities was $4.8 million, comprised primarily of the net\nproceeds from securities offerings in the six months ended June 30, 2023, and the decrease in restricted cash,\npartially offset by the repayment of payables related to the purchase of intangible assets.\nCash Balance as of June 30, 2024 was $8.2 million1.\nR&D and Commercial Highlights:\nR&D:\nRedHill’s pipeline is centered around opaganib3 & RHB-1074, two promising, potentially broad utility, novel, oral,\nhost-directed small molecule drugs with demonstrated safety and efficacy profiles. Both candidates are advancing in\npredominantly U.S. government-supported, externally-funded programs, directed at multiple underserved indications\nwith sizeable multi-billion-dollar market opportunities and potentially advantageous pathways to approval.\nBetween them, they are in development for multiple oncology, viral, inflammatory and diabetes and obesity-related\nindications, including COVID-19, Ebola, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and radio/chemical protection\n(Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and Sulfur Mustard exposure).\nBeing (i) easy to administer and distribute and (ii) viral mutation-resistant, they are ideally suited for stockpiling\nstrategies in the event of nuclear/chemical incidents and viral pandemic scenarios.\nOpaganib:\n· U.S. Army program for Ebola. Opaganib is believed to be the first host-directed molecule to show activity\nin vivo in Ebola virus disease, delivering a statistically significant increase in survival and, separately,\ndemonstrating a robust synergistic effect in vitro when combined with remdesivir (Veklury®; Gilead\nSciences, Inc.), improving viral inhibition while maintaining cell viability\n· Orphan drug designation granted by FDA for neuroblastoma (opaganib has several such designations in\nmultiple indications, with three in oncology)\n· Discussions ongoing for a potential externally-funded, late-stage study in an additional underserved\noncology indication\n· Positive in vivo study results support potential of opaganib therapy in diabetes / obesity-related disorders\n- a market projected to be worth approximately $100 billion within the next decade\n4\n· U.S. government-funded programs ongoing with the NIH / BARDA-funded nuclear and chemical medical\ncountermeasure programs for ARS and Sulfur Mustard exposure\n· Late-stage COVID-19 program continues to address a multi-hundreds of millions of dollars market\n· New opaganib publications:\no The Sphingolipid-Modulating Drug Opaganib Protects against Radiation-Induced Lung\nInflammation and Fibrosis: Potential Uses as a Medical Countermeasure and in Cancer\nRadiotherapy. Publication showed that opaganib significantly improved long-term survival in an in\nvivo model of lung damage following exposure to ionizing radiation5\no Effect of Opaganib on Supplemental Oxygen and Mortality in Patients with Severe SARS-CoV-2\nBased Upon FiO2 Requirements. Publication showed that oral opaganib reduced mortality by 62%\nand delivered improved time to room air, and faster time to hospital discharge in a large group of\n251 hospitalized, moderately severe COVID-19 patients requiring a Fraction of inspired Oxygen up\nto and including 60% (FiO2≤60%). The paper also indicates that due to the lack of treatment effect\nin patients requiring FiO2>60%, this may represent a threshold level for disease irreversibility\n(likely due to more severe COVID-19 lung disease) and be an important patient selection clinical\nbiomarker, a key finding for future therapeutic strategies and studies6\n· New Chinese patents granted for opaganib:\no In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a method of inducing an anti-cancer\nimmune response. Provides protection for opaganib's potential use in combination with a range of\napproved and in-development ICIs across a growing range of indications through 2040\no As a therapy for inhibition of single-stranded RNA virus replication (notably Ebola Disease Virus);\nvalid through 2035\nRHB-107 (upamostat):\n· COVID-19: Enrollment ongoing in the U.S Department of Defense-supported 300-patient Phase 2 ACESO\nPROTECT platform trial for early COVID-19 outpatient treatment. Enrollment is estimated to be\ncompleted in the first half of 2025\n· U.S. Army-funded Ebola development program ongoing; RHB-107 also demonstrated a robust synergistic\neffect in vitro when combined with remdesivir. Management of potential Ebola virus pandemic outbreaks\nrepresents a significant opportunity and is a key concern for global health agencies\nRHB-1047: Newly published positive Phase 3 data demonstrated 64% increased efficacy with RHB-104 in Crohn's\ndisease\nCommercial:\nTalicia: The leading prescribed branded H. pylori therapy in the U.S., maintaining leadership position with a\nstreamlined commercial team:\n· Expected upcoming new H. pylori treatment guidelines may further enhance positioning and use\n· Potential manufacturing developments aiming to open additional new markets underway\n· Now commercially launched in the UAE, triggering RedHill’s eligibility for potential milestone and royalty\npayments\n· Two new U.S. patent grants covering Talicia as:\no A method for eradicating H. pylori regardless of BMI, valid until May 2042\no Use as an all-in-one treatment of H. pylori infection, valid until 2034\nAbout RedHill Biopharma\nRedHill Biopharma Ltd.

STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL:\na. General\n1) RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (the “Company”), incorporated on August 3, 2009, together with its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, RedHill Biopharma Inc. (“RedHill Inc.”), incorporated in Delaware, U.S. on January 19, 2017, is\na specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases and infectious\ndiseases.\nThe Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) were traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from\nDecember 27, 2012, were listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) from July 20, 2018, and have been\nagain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since November 15, 2023. On March 23, 2023, the Company\nchanged the ADS ratio from 1 ADS representing 10 ordinary shares to 1 ADS representing 400 ordinary\nshares. On August 20, 2024, after the condensed consolidated interim financial statements date, the Company\nchanged the ADS to ordinary share ratio from 1 ADS representing 400 ordinary shares to 1 ADS representing\n10,000 ordinary shares. The ADSs and per ADS amounts in these interim financial statements reflect the old\nratio of 1 ADS to 400 ordinary shares.\nThe Company’s registered address is 21 Ha’arba’a St, Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n2) Since the Company established its commercial presence in the U.S. in 2017, it has promoted or\ncommercialized various GI-related products that were either developed internally or acquired through in-\nlicensing agreements. As of the date of approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements, the Company commercializes in the U.S., mainly Talicia®, for the treatment of Helicobacter\npylori infection in adults, the first product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)\nbeing developed primarily internally by the Company. Until February 1, 2023, the Company commercialized\nMovantik® in the U.S, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation. See also note 15(6) in the annual\nfinancial statements as of December 31, 2023 regarding the transfer of the Company’s rights in Movantik®\nto HCR Collateral Management, LLC (“HCRM”) in exchange for all the Company’s debt obligations under\nthe Credit Agreement with HCRM (see also note 10). The Company also continues to advance the\ndevelopment of part of its late-stage therapeutic candidates.\n3) Through June 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit and negative working capital, and its\nactivities have been funded primarily through public and private offerings of the Company’s securities and\nsecured borrowing (now fully extinguished, see note 15(6) in the annual financial statements as of December\n31, 2023(. There is no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sustainable positive cash flows to\nfund its business.\nThe Company plans to further fund its future operations through commercialization and out-licensing of its\ntherapeutic candidates, commercialization of in-licensed or acquired products and raising additional capital\nthrough equity or debt financing or through other non-dilutive financing. Furthermore, the Company is\nactively pursuing and in discussions with multiple parties regarding strategic business development\ntransactions, including potential divestment of certain of the Company’s assets and/or its commercial\noperations, which the Company expects would provide it with additional capital, although there is no\nguarantee that the Company will complete such a transaction on favorable terms. The Company’s current\ncash resources are not sufficient to complete the research and development of any of its therapeutic\ncandidates and to fully support its commercial operations until generation of sustainable positive cash flows.\nManagement expects that the Company will incur additional losses as it continues to focus its resources on\nadvancing the development of its therapeutic candidates, as well as advancing its commercial operations,\nbased on a prioritized plan that will result in negative cash flows from operating activities. Management\nbelieves that there is presently insufficient funding available to allow\n7\nREDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nthe Company to fund its activities for a period exceeding one year from the date of this filing. These\nconditions and events indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt (or raise\nsubstantial doubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that\nthe Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty.\n4) In October 2023, Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization and entered a state of war. As of the date of\nthese condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the war in Israel is ongoing and continues to\nevolve. During six months ended of June 30,2024, the impact of this war on the Company results and\nfinancial condition was immaterial, but such impact may increase.\nb. Approval of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements:\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the\n\"BoD\") on August 28, 2024.\nNOTE 2 - BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\na. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (the\n\"Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\"), have been prepared in accordance with International\nAccounting Standard IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”. These Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial\nStatements, that are unaudited, do not include all the information and disclosures that would otherwise be\nrequired in a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual\nfinancial statements as of December 31, 2023, and their accompanying notes, which have been prepared in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as published by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024, are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or for any other interim period.\nb. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n1) General\nThe accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial\nStatements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements as of\nDecember 31, 2023, except for the reclassification of derivative financial instruments from non-current\nliabilities to current liabilities, as described in note 2b(2).\n2) New international financial reporting standards, amendments to standards and new interpretations\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendment to IAS 1)\nThe narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements,” clarify that liabilities are\nclassified as either current or noncurrent, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period.\nClassification is unaffected by the entity’s expectations or events after the reporting date. The amendments\nalso clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the settlement’ of a liability. The amendments may affect the\nclassification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered\n8\nREDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nmanagement’s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.\nThe Company adopted these amendments effective January 1, 2024. The impact on the Company’s financial\nstatements of these amendments was the reclassification of the Company’s derivative financial instruments\nfrom non-current to current as of its effective date. The Company has retrospectively applied the amendments\nin these interim financial statements and, accordingly, has retrospectively adjusted the comparative balance\nsheet for December 31, 2023 to reclassify its warrant liabilities ($741 as of December 31, 2023) from non-\ncurrent to current. Adoption of the amendments had no other impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements\nThis standard replaces the international accounting standard IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements.”\nAs part of the new disclosure requirements, companies will be required to present new defined subtotals in\nthe statements of income, as follows: (1) operating profit and (2) profit before financing and tax. In addition,\nincome statement items will be classified into three defined categories: operating, investment and financing.\nThe standard also includes a requirement to provide a separate disclosure in the financial statements\nregarding the use of management-defined performance measures (“non-GAAP measures”), and specific\ninstructions were added for the grouping and splitting of items in the financial statements and in the notes to\nthe financial statements. IFRS 18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,\n2027, with an option for early adoption.\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD:\na. On January 26, 2024, the Company issued 10,000,000 ADSs at a purchase price of $0.80 per ADS and\nwarrants to purchase 10,000,000 ADSs at an exercise price of $1.00 per ADS. These warrants may be\nexercised in cash or on a cashless basis, are immediately exercisable, and expire in five years. The Company\nalso issued to the placement agent warrants to purchase 600,000 ADSs under the same terms. The gross\nproceeds from the offering were $8 million, before deducting approximately $0.9 million in fees and\nexpenses.\nThe warrants were classified as a financial liability due to a net settlement provision. These derivatives were\nrecognized and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Upon initial recognition the fair\nvalue of the warrants was adjusted to reflect the unrecognized day 1 loss. This unrecognized day 1 loss is\namortized over the warrants’ contractual life. Consequently, $0.9 million of issuance costs allocated to the\nwarrants, were included directly in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See also\nnote 7.\nb. On March 21, 2024, the Annual General Meeting of shareholders approved the increase of the authorized\nshare capital of the Company to NIS 400,000,000 divided into (i) 39,994,000,000 registered Ordinary Shares\nof NIS 0.01 par value each, and (ii) 6,000,000 preferred shares of NIS 0.01 par value each.\nc. On April 3, 2024, the Company issued 2,144,487 ADSs at a purchase price of $0.58289 per ADS and\nwarrants to purchase 2,144,487 ADSs at an exercise price of $0.75 per ADS. These warrants may be\nexercised in cash or on a cashless basis, are immediately exercisable and expire in five years. The gross\nproceeds from the offering were $1.25 million, before deducting offering expenses approximately $0.1\nmillion in expesnses.\nThe warrants were classified as a financial liability due to a net settlement provision. These derivatives were\nrecognized and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. The consideration, net of issue\nexpenses, was allocated to the various issued instruments. Out of the gross consideration, $0.9 million was\nallocated to the warrants. The remainder of approximately $0.35 million was allocated to\n9\nREDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nequity. Issuance expenses allocated to the liability instruments were recorded directly in the Consolidated\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and , while those allocated to equity were recorded against\nadditional paid in capital.

On June 24, 2024, the BoD granted 1,044,000 RSUs to employees and consultants. These RSUs will vest\nin 8 equal quarterly installments over two years and had a fair value of $0.4 million on the grant date,\nbased on the ADS price on that date. In addition, the BoD approved the grant of 383,000 RSUs for\ndirectors and the Company's Chief Executive Officer in the same terms, subject to Annual General\nMeeting approval. The fair value of these RSUs on the date of approval was $0.1 million.\n2. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 24,000 options and RSUs were forfeited,\nmainly due to a reduction in the number of employees, leading to an expense reversal of approximately\n$0.3 million.\nNOTE 6 - NET REVENUES:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nU.S dollars in thousands\nSales of products 2,572 5,395\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, the Company recorded contra-revenues of\n($0.9) million and ($0.2) million for Movantik®, respectively, primarily due to returns following its\ndivestiture on February 1, 2023 (see note 15(6) in the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023).\nCorrespondingly, net revenues from other products (mainly Talicia®) were $3.5 million in the first half of\n2024, including $0.5\n10\nREDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nmillion from sales to Gaelan Medical Trade LLC, which has an exclusive license for Talicia® in the UAE\n(see note 15(7) in the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023). In the first half of 2023, net\nrevenues from other products (mainly Talicia®) were $5.6 million, all from U.S. sales.\nNOTE 7 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:\na. The Company’s derivative financial liability, represented by warrants, is measured at fair value and classified as\nlevel 3. Fair value adjustments are recognized in profit or loss as financial income or expenses. The following\ntable presents the change in this level 3 derivative liability for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30,\n2023:\nDerivative financial instruments\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nBalance at beginning of the period 741 2,623\nInitial recognition of financial liability 9,860 7,083\nInitial recognition of unrecognized day 1\nloss (952) —\nFair value adjustments recognized in\nprofit or loss (7,108) (8,071)\nBalance at end of the period 2,541 1,635\nThe fair value of the warrants is computed using the Black-Scholes model. As of June 30,2024, it is based on the\nADS price on that date and the following key parameters: risk-free interest rate of 4.35%-4.48% and volatility of\n120.5%-133.6%. As of June 30,2023, it is based on the ADS price on that date and the following key parameters:\nrisk-free interest rate of 4.17%-5.47% and volatility of 86.6%-99.5%.\nb. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash, receivables, account payables and accrued\nexpenses approximate their fair value due to their short-term characteristics.\nNOTE 8 - SEGMENT INFORMATION:\nThe Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM allocates\nresources and assesses the Company’s performance based on the following segmentation: Commercial Operations\nand Research & Development.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss before depreciation, amortization, and financial income (expenses),\nadjusted to exclude share-based compensation, gains from early termination of leases, and other income, which\nincludes income from service provided to HCRM and gain from the sale of Movantik®.\nThe following table presents segment profitability and a reconciliation to the consolidated net income (loss) and\ncomprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nCommercial Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDA (4,681) (11,031)\nResearch And Development Adjusted EBITDA (3,143) (5,550)\nFinancial income, net 5,360 26,330\nShare-based compensation to employees and service providers (229) (849)\nDepreciation (402) (1,055)\nAmortization of intangible assets (16) (530)\nGain from early termination of lease, net 23 694\nOther income — 42,993\nConsolidated Comprehensive income (loss) (3,088) 51,002\n11\nREDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 9 - EARNING (LOSS) PER SHARE:\nThe basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same since the effect of all potentially diluted ordinary\nshares for all reporting periods is anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 10 - EVENT SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2024:\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company and RedHill Inc signed a Global Termination Agreement with Movantik\nAcquisition Co., Valinor Pharma, LLC, and HCR Redhill SPV, LLC, affiliates of HCRM (the “Global\nTermination Agreement”). This agreement terminates the Credit Agreement from February 23, 2020, which\nwas amended on February 2, 2023, as part of the transaction where the rights to Movantik® were sold to\nHCRM in exchange for extinguishing all debt obligations under the Credit Agreement. The February 2023\nagreement had placed a lien Talicia® and Aemcolo® assets and established an escrow account with restricted\nfunds for Movantik® liabilities (for further details, see note 1(a)(2) above and notes 14(a), 15(4), 15(5), and\n15(6) to the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023).\nThe Global Termination Agreement terminates all existing credit ties, removing the aforementioned lien and\nrestoring control over the restricted escrow funds. The Company received approximately $9.9 million in cash\nand gained full control over $0.7 million previously held in the restricted account. Under the Global\nTermination Agreement, the Company assumed certain liabilities related to Movantik® from the other parties\nand settled additional liabilities between the parties. This resulted in an increase of approximately $12.2\nmillion in the Company's future obligations, reflecting these assumed and settled amounts.\n12"

Talicia\nnet revenues were $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5.1 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023, mainly due to a 26% decrease in gross revenues and a 9% increase in Gross-to-Net\ndeductions, mainly from increased Medicaid rebates. In the \u0000rst half of 2024, $0.5 million of net revenues came\nfrom sales in the UAE. Talicia scripts in the U.S. in the \u0000rst half of 2024 were down by approximately 12%, compared\nto the same period in 2023, mainly due to reduced promotion and marketing following employee terminations and\nother cost-cutting measures in the United States. These measures had a signi\u0000cant positive impact on reducing\nexpenses, as detailed below.\nMovantik had negative net revenues of $0.9 million in the \u0000rst half of 2024, compared to negative net revenues of\n$0.1 million in the \u0000rst half of 2023, mainly due to returns related to sales in the second and third quarters of 2020.\nGross Pro\u0000t for the \u0000rst half of 2024 was $1.2 million, compared to $3 million for the \u0000rst half of 2023, in line with\nthe decrease in Net Revenues as explained above and primarily attributable to the reduction in Talicia prescriptions\nfollowing employee terminations and other cost-cutting measures.\n3\nResearch and Development Expenses for the \u0000rst half of 2024 were $0.7 million, as compared to $2.3 million for\nthe \u0000rst half of 2023. The decrease is mainly attributable to the costs from closing the RHB-204 clinical trial, which\nwere recognized in the \u0000rst half of 2023, and to ongoing cost-reduction measures.\nSelling, Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses for the \u0000rst half of 2024 were $9 million, compared\nto $19 million for the \u0000rst half of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to downsizing the U.S. workforce following\nthe Movantik divestiture, leading to lower payroll and related expenses, and reduced sales force expenses.\nOther Income – There was no other income for the \u0000rst half of 2024, as compared to $43 million of other income\nfor the \u0000rst half of 2023. The other income recognized in the \u0000rst half of 2023 was comprised of (i) $35.5 million\nfrom the divestiture of Movantik and (ii) $7.5 million from transitional services fees provided to the buyer of\nMovantik.\nOperating Loss for the \u0000rst half of 2024 was $8.4 million, compared to operating income of $24.7 million for the\n\u0000rst half of 2023. The di\u0000erence is primarily attributable to the changes resulting from the divestiture of Movantik\nthe previous year, as detailed above. Excluding the other income from the Movantik transaction in 2023, the\noperating loss decreased by approximately $9.9 million, from an operating loss of $18.3 million for the \u0000rst half of\n2023, re\u0000ecting the positive operating impact of the cost-cutting measures.\nFinancial Income, net for the \u0000rst half of 2024 was $5.4 million, compared to $26.3 million for the \u0000rst half of 2023.\nIn the \u0000rst half of 2024, the income recognized was mainly attributable to warrants' revaluation, o\u0000set by o\u0000erings'\nexpenses. In the \u0000rst half of 2023, the income recognized was primarily attributable to a $20.6 million gain resulting\nfrom the extinguishment of the HCR Collateral Management LLC debt in exchange for the transfer of rights to\nMovantik.\nNet Loss was $3.1 million for the \u0000rst half of 2024, compared to net income of $51 million for the \u0000rst half of 2023.\nThis change was primarily attributable to the e\u0000ects resulting from the sale of Movantik and ongoing cost-reduction\nmeasures, as detailed above. Excluding the other income and \u0000nancial income from the Movantik transaction in\n2023, the net loss decreased by approximately $9.5 million, from a net loss of $12.6 million for the \u0000rst half of 2023,\nre\u0000ecting the positive net impact of the cost-cutting measures.\nTotal Assets as of June 30, 2024 were $22 million, as compared to $23 million as of December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the inventory balance due to sales, as well as a reduction in\nright-of-use assets, due to termination of car leases in the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nTotal Liabilities as of June 30, 2024 were $22 million, as compared to $21 million as of December 31, 2023. The\n4\nincrease is mainly due to higher allowance from deductions from revenues and increased warrant-related\nderivative liabilities, partially o\u0000set by lower accounts payable, accrued expenses and lease liabilities (due to the car\nleases' termination).\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $6.2 million, compared to $17.8\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to settling pre-closing liabilities\nassociated with Movantik and other operational activities in the six months ended June 30, 2023. Furthermore, this\nreduction is attributable to the cost-cutting measures mentioned above.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $7.9 million, comprised\nprimarily of the net proceeds from securities o\u0000erings in the six months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months\nended June 30, 2023, Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities was $4.8 million, comprised primarily of the net\nproceeds from securities o\u0000erings in the six months ended June 30, 2023, and the decrease in restricted cash,\npartially o\u0000set by the repayment of payables related to the purchase of intangible assets.\nCash Balance as of June 30, 2024 was $8.2 million1.\nR&D and Commercial Highlights:\nR&D:\nRedHill's pipeline is centered around opaganib[3] & RHB-107[4], two promising, potentially broad utility, novel, oral,\nhost-directed small molecule drugs with demonstrated safety and e\u0000cacy pro\u0000les. Both candidates are advancing\nin predominantly U.S. government-supported, externally-funded programs, directed at multiple underserved\nindications with sizeable multi-billion-dollar market opportunities and potentially advantageous pathways to\napproval.\nBetween them, they are in development for multiple oncology, viral, in\u0000ammatory and diabetes and obesity-related\nindications, including COVID-19, Ebola, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and radio/chemical protection\n(Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and Sulfur Mustard exposure).\nBeing (i) easy to administer and distribute and (ii) viral mutation-resistant, they are ideally suited for stockpiling\nstrategies in the event of nuclear/chemical incidents and viral pandemic scenarios.\nOpaganib:\nU.S. Army program for Ebola. Opaganib is believed to be the \u0000rst host-directed molecule to show activity in\n5\nvivo in Ebola virus disease, delivering a statistically signi\u0000cant increase in survival and, separately,\ndemonstrating a robust synergistic e\u0000ect in vitro when combined with remdesivir (Veklury®; Gilead Sciences,\nInc.), improving viral inhibition while maintaining cell viability\nOrphan drug designation granted by FDA for neuroblastoma (opaganib has several such designations in\nmultiple indications, with three in oncology)\nDiscussions ongoing for a potential externally-funded, late-stage study in an additional underserved\noncology indication\nPositive in vivo study results support potential of opaganib therapy in diabetes / obesity-related disorders –\na market projected to be worth approximately $100 billion within the next decade\nU.S. government-funded programs ongoing with the NIH / BARDA-funded nuclear and chemical medical\ncountermeasure programs for ARS and Sulfur Mustard exposure\nLate-stage COVID-19 program continues to address a multi-hundreds of millions of dollars market\nNew opaganib publications:\n- The Sphingolipid-Modulating Drug Opaganib Protects against Radiation-Induced Lung In\u0000ammation and\nFibrosis: Potential Uses as a Medical Countermeasure and in Cancer Radiotherapy. Publication showed\nthat opaganib signi\u0000cantly improved long-term survival in an in vivo model of lung damage following\nexposure to ionizing radiation[5]\n- E\u0000ect of Opaganib on Supplemental Oxygen and Mortality in Patients with Severe SARS-CoV-2 Based\nUpon FiO2 Requirements. Publication showed that oral opaganib reduced mortality by 62% and delivered\nimproved time to room air, and faster time to hospital discharge in a large group of 251 hospitalized,\nmoderately severe COVID-19 patients requiring a Fraction of inspired Oxygen up to and including 60%\n(FiO2≤60%). The paper also indicates that due to the lack of treatment e\u0000ect in patients requiring FiO2>60%,\nthis may represent a threshold level for disease irreversibility (likely due to more severe COVID-19 lung\ndisease) and be an important patient selection clinical biomarker, a key \u0000nding for future therapeutic\nstrategies and studies[6]\nNew Chinese patents granted for opaganib:\n- In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a method of inducing an anti-cancer immune\nresponse. Provides protection for opaganib's potential use in combination with a range of approved and in-\ndevelopment ICIs across a growing range of indications through 2040\n- As a therapy for inhibition of single-stranded RNA virus replication (notably Ebola Disease Virus); valid\nthrough 2035\nRHB-107 (upamostat):\nCOVID-19: Enrollment ongoing in the U.S Department of Defense-supported 300-patient Phase 2 ACESO\nPROTECT platform trial for early COVID-19 outpatient treatment. Enrollment is estimated to be completed in\n6\nthe \u0000rst half of 2025\nU.S. Army-funded Ebola development program ongoing; RHB-107 also demonstrated a robust synergistic\ne\u0000ect in vitro when combined with remdesivir.
