(\"Nabors\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NBR) today reported third quarter 2024 operating revenues of $732 million, compared to operating revenues of $735 million in the second quarter. The net loss attributable to Nabors shareholders for the quarter was $56 million, compared to a net loss of $32 million in the second quarter. This equates to a loss of $6.86 per diluted share, compared to a loss per diluted share of $4.29 in the second quarter. The third quarter included net charges totaling approximately $25 million, primarily reflecting the redemption premium on the 2026 notes and market adjustments on investments. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $222 million, compared to $218 million in the previous quarter.\n\n_Highlights_\n\n  * Loading...\n\n\n\n\n[Previous Item](#prev \"Previous\")[Next Item](#next \"Next\")\n\n[Continue Reading](#continue)\n\n  * ![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=600)\n\n[](https://investor.nabors.com/2024-10-22-Nabors-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results#assets_3:205)\n\n[View File](https://investor.nabors.com/2024-10-22-Nabors-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results#assets_3:205) [Download File](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=10000)\n\n\n\n\n  * Last week, Nabors announced the signing of an agreement to acquire Parker Wellbore. Parker's lines of business include the leading franchise in U.S. tubular rentals – Quail Tools – as well as international tubular rentals, well construction services (including casing running), and drilling rigs. Parker expects to generate EBITDA of $180 million this year. Nabors has identified synergies potential at an annualized run-rate of $35 million within 12 months of closing. Nabors will acquire all of Parker's issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for 4.8 million shares of Nabors common stock, subject to a share price collar. Nabors will also assume approximately $100 million in net debt.\n  * Nabors Lower 48 rigs once again set notable performance milestones. A major operator in the Delaware Basin drilled three wells, each with four-mile laterals, utilizing a Nabors PACE®-X rig equipped with a Canrig® Sigma topdrive. Sigma's rated torque is the industry's highest and is ideal for the larger-diameter drill pipe run on these wells. The rig also employed an NDS technology package.\n  * A large operator in the Eagle Ford drilled its longest well in the basin, incorporating a lateral length of more than four miles. The lateral was drilled in a single run without the use of rotary steerable systems. The rig was a Nabors PACE®-M1000, utilizing larger-diameter drill pipe.\n  * A large operator in the Bakken completed a four-mile lateral in a single run in under 12 days, utilizing a Nabors PACE®-X rig. This well is the operator's first four-mile lateral, and the operator believes it is the quickest in the Bakken. The rig was equipped with a comprehensive package of NDS Smart technology.\n\n\n\nAnthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, \"We are excited as we move forward with our announced acquisition of Parker Wellbore. Our companies' portfolios are highly complementary. Parker's recent track record speaks for itself. Quail Tools, already the leader in its space, plays a key role as operators extend the lengths of their wellbore laterals. The transaction increases our scale, provides incremental growth and improves our leverage metrics.\n\n\"Our third quarter operating results matched our overall expectations. Higher average daily margins and an improved mix drove growth in our International Drilling segment. International growth also resulted in better performance for our Drilling Solutions segment.\n\n\"Daily margins in our International Drilling segment exceeded the $17,000 mark in the third quarter. We reached this milestone earlier than we expected. This result demonstrates the earnings power of our International segment. During the quarter we also started up previously awarded rigs. We have a path to substantial international growth with 13 rigs scheduled to deploy through early 2026 in the Middle East and Latin America. The opportunity set on top of those planned start-ups is also substantial.\n\n\"In the Lower 48 market, our leading-edge pricing remained stable, supporting daily rig margins that were essentially in line with our expectations. Our average rig count was just under the prior quarter. Although we have not yet seen the anticipated increases in gas-directed drilling or a recovery from reductions driven by E&P consolidation, we look forward to an improvement in Lower 48 drilling activity in 2025.\"\n\n_Segment Results_\n\nInternational Drilling adjusted EBITDA totaled $116.0 million, compared to $106.4 million in the second quarter. Average rig count increased to 85 from 84, driven by rig additions in Algeria and Saudi Arabia. Daily adjusted gross margin for the third quarter averaged $17,085, an increase of more than $1,000 compared to the prior quarter.\n\nThe U.S. Drilling segment reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $108.7 million, compared to $114.0 million in the second quarter. Nabors' third quarter Lower 48 average rig count totaled 68, versus 69 in the second quarter. Daily adjusted gross margin in the Lower 48 averaged $15,051, versus $15,598 in the prior quarter.\n\nDrilling Solutions adjusted EBITDA increased to $34.3 million, compared to $32.5 million in the second quarter. This growth was driven by higher revenue in international markets of approximately 8% and higher penetration of performance software on Nabors U.S. rigs.\n\nRig Technologies' adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million, versus $7.3 million in the second quarter. The decrease was spread across several business lines in the U.S., mainly capital equipment, spare parts, and energy transition.\n\n_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_\n\nAdjusted free cash flow was $18 million in the third quarter compared to $57 million in the preceding quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million, including $37 million supporting the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia. This compares to $138 million in the second quarter, including $56 million supporting the newbuilds. The third quarter included two and a half additional months of interest payments for the notes issued late last year, translating into $11.7 million of interest. The first coupon payment for the notes occurred eight months after the notes were issued. Total interest payments for the quarter were $82 million, compared to $31 million in the prior quarter.\n\nWilliam Restrepo, Nabors CFO, stated, \"Last week we signed an agreement to acquire Parker Wellbore. The transaction is well aligned with our long-term strategy. It grows our capex-light NDS business, expands our international footprint, and helps us delever Nabors. Additionally, Parker is on track to earn meaningful EBITDA this year, totaling $180 million with attractive growth. Finally, Parker comes with low debt and it generates positive cash flow. This is before targeted annual synergies of $35 million. We are excited about the addition of Parker to the Nabors platform.\n\n\"Nabors' third quarter results met our outlook. Daily adjusted gross margin in our International Drilling segment expanded by more than $1,000. We reached the $17,000 daily margin target a quarter ahead of schedule, driven by exceptional performances in Saudi Arabia and Latin America, which both increased daily margins, by $1,200 and $1,300 respectively. We have three rigs scheduled to deploy in the fourth quarter, each with attractive economics. These deployments will be somewhat offset by the 12-month suspension of three lower-margin rigs in the Kingdom.\n\n\"Strength in the international markets also led to sequential growth in our Drilling Solutions business. We experienced an increase in international casing running jobs, augmented by greater deployment of performance software products, driving the segment's gross margin above 53%.\n\n\"In our Lower 48 drilling business, pricing discipline and strict expense control maintained our average daily margin above $15,000 and in line with our forecast. We expect relative stability in the fourth quarter in both margin and rig count. Our rig count forecast is dependent on stable oil prices, a similar level of churn, and stability in the overall market.\n\n\"Our capital spending target for the fourth quarter is now $230 million, with capital expenditures for SANAD newbuilds forecast at $105 million. The resulting annual capital spending forecast for 2024 is now $600 million, including $230 million related to the SANAD newbuilds. SANAD's rig supplier has improved its performance in reaching manufacturing milestones. We now expect earlier delivery of our rigs going forward. This has accelerated approximately $40 million of newbuild capital spending into 2024. We are targeting reductions in various markets to offset this increase.\n\n\"Given the SANAD newbuild capital expenditures moving forward to 2024, the recent rig suspensions in Saudi Arabia and the slightly lower U.S. activity in the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year free cash flow to close between $100 and $130 million.\"\n\n_Outlook_\n\nNabors expects the following metrics for the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\nU.S. Drilling \n\n  * Lower 48 average rig count of approximately 68 rigs\n  * Lower 48 daily adjusted gross margin of $15,000\n  * Alaska and Gulf of Mexico combined adjusted EBITDA up approximately $1.5 million versus the third quarter, with an additional rig starting work in Alaska\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n  * Average rig count of approximately 84 rigs\n  * Daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $17,000\n\n\n\nDrilling Solutions\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $36 to $37 million\n\n\n\nRig Technologies\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $9 to $10 million\n\n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n  * Capital expenditures of $230 million, with $105 million for the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia\n  * Full-year capital expenditures of approximately $600 million, with $230 million for the SANAD newbuilds\n  * This forecast includes accelerated timelines from SANAD's rig supplier totaling an estimated $40 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n\n  * Full-year adjusted free cash flow of $100 to $130 million\n\n\n\nMr. Petrello concluded, \"The results from our International Drilling segment demonstrate the value we are building in this business. With our pending rig deployments across markets, our path to future growth is well defined. Our success is driven in large part from our advanced technology. We see the global client base increasingly embracing the benefits of our solutions.\"\n\nAbout Nabors Industries\n\nNabors Industries (NYSE: NBR) is a leading provider of advanced technology for the energy industry.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, Nabors' actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect management's estimates and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Nabors does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. \n\nNon-GAAP Disclaimer\n\nThis press release presents certain \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted operating income (loss) represents income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, investment income (loss), and other, net. Adjusted EBITDA is computed similarly, but also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. Net debt is calculated as total debt minus the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash flow, after reinvesting in the company for future growth, that could be available for paying down debt or other financing cash flows, such as dividends to shareholders. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies.\n\nEach of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and therefore should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss), net debt, and adjusted free cash flow, because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability, performance and liquidity. Securities analysts and investors also use these measures as some of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. Reconciliations of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, net debt to total debt, and adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operations, which are their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures, are included in the tables at the end of this press release. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of our outlook for Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Gross Margin or Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as the amount and significance of items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts. These special items could be meaningful.\n\nInvestor Contacts: William C.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability and performance. Securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income (loss), which is the most closely comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table set forth immediately following the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Net Income (Loss)\".  \n(4) | Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses.  \n(5) | Adjusted operating income (loss) represents net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), investment income (loss), interest expense and other, net. Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP.

These would typically include days in which operating, standby and move revenue is earned.  \n(7) | Average rigs working represents a measure of the average number of rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter. On an annual period, one rig operating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year. Average rigs working can also be calculated as rig revenue days during the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period.  \n(8) | Daily rig revenue represents operating revenue, divided by the total number of revenue days during the quarter.  \n(9) | Daily adjusted gross margin represents operating revenue less direct costs, divided by the total number of rig revenue days during the quarter.  \n(10) | The U.S. Drilling segment includes the Lower 48, Alaska, and Gulf of Mexico operating areas.  \n  \n**NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD.

References in this report to “Nabors Delaware” mean Nabors\nIndustries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nabors.\nOur business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig related services\nand technologies. We provide performance tools, directional drilling services, tubular running services and innovative\ntechnologies for our own rig fleet and those operated by third parties. In addition, we manufacture advanced drilling\nequipment and provide drilling rig instrumentation. Also, we have a portfolio of technologies designed to drive energy\nefficiency and emissions reductions for both ourselves and our third-party customers.\nWith operations in over 15 countries, we are a global provider of drilling and drilling-related services for land-based\nand offshore oil and natural gas wells, with a fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment which, as of September 30, 2024\nincluded:\n● 289 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States and various countries\nthroughout the world; and\n● 26 actively marketed rigs for offshore platform drilling operations in the United States and multiple international\nmarkets.\nThe short- and long-term implications of the military hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, which began in early\n2022, remain difficult to predict. We continue to actively monitor this dynamic situation. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, 0.8% and 0.9% of our property, plant and equipment, net was located in Russia, respectively. For the\nnine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, 0.9% and 1.2% of our operating revenues were from operations in\nRussia, respectively. We currently have no assets or operations in Ukraine.\nNote 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nInterim Financial Information\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Nabors have been prepared in\nconformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) applicable to interim\nreporting. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”),\ncertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP have been omitted. Therefore, these financial statements should be read together with our annual report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report”). In management’s opinion, the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary\nto state fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss),\ncash flows and changes in equity for the periods presented herein. Interim results for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 may not be indicative of results that will be realized for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nabors, as well as all majority-owned and\nnon-majority owned subsidiaries consolidated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All significant intercompany accounts and\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn addition to the consolidation of our majority owned subsidiaries, we also consolidate variable interest entities\n(“VIE”) when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nis based on whether an entity has (a) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic\n9\nTable of Contents\nperformance of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Our determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships\nbetween us and the VIE. Our joint venture, SANAD, which is equally owned by Saudi Aramco and Nabors, has been\nconsolidated. As we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact SANAD’s economic performance,\nincluding operations, maintenance and certain sourcing and procurement, we have determined Nabors to be the primary\nbeneficiary. See Note 3—Joint Ventures. Also, we are the co-sponsor of a special purpose acquisition company (the\n“SPAC”) and have determined it is a VIE. Nabors is the primary beneficiary of the SPAC as we have the power to direct\nactivities, the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses. Therefore, the SPAC has been consolidated. See\nNote 13—Special Purpose Acquisition Company.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These\nreclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out or\nweighted-average cost methods and includes the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventory included\nthe following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nRaw materials $ 132,018 $ 144,886\nWork-in-progress 7,309 2,912\nFinished goods 2,537 —\n$ 141,864 $ 147,798\nRecent accounting pronouncements\n1RW\u0003<HW\u0003$GRSWHG\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 6HJPHQW\u00035HSRUWLQJ\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0015\u001b\u0013 , which enhances prior reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements in part by requiring entities to disclose significant expenses related to their reportable\nsegments that are regularly provided to the chief operation decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to\nsegment profit or loss. The guidance also requires disclosure of the CODM’s position for each segment and detail of how\nthe CODM uses financial reporting to access their segment’s performance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and should\nbe applied retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 requires us to provide additional disclosures related to our\nsegments, but will otherwise not materially impact our financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): ,PSURYHPHQW\u0003WR\u0003,QFRPH\u00037D[\n'LVFORVXUHV\u000f\u0003to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This provides qualitative and\nquantitative updates to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, including consistent categories and greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The new\nguidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of this\naccounting standard update on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. We assessed ASUs not listed above and determined that they\neither were not applicable or do not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nNote 3 Joint Ventures\nDuring 2016, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Aramco to form a joint venture known as SANAD to own,\nmanage and operate onshore drilling rigs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. SANAD is equally owned by Saudi Aramco and\nNabors.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDuring 2017, Nabors and Saudi Aramco each contributed $20 million in cash for the purpose of capitalizing the joint\nventure upon formation. In addition, since inception Nabors and Saudi Aramco have each contributed a combination of\ndrilling rigs, drilling rig equipment and other assets, including cash, with each of the party’s contributions having a value of\napproximately $394 million to the joint venture. The contributions were received in exchange for redeemable ownership\ninterests which accrue interest annually, have a twenty-five year maturity and are required to be converted to authorized\ncapital should certain events occur, including the accumulation of specified losses. In the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet, Nabors has reported Saudi Aramco’s share of authorized capital as a component of\nnoncontrolling interest in equity and Saudi Aramco’s share of the redeemable ownership interests as redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest in subsidiary, classified as mezzanine equity. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\namount included in redeemable noncontrolling interest was $445.5 million and $423.6 million, respectively. The accrued\ninterest on the redeemable ownership interest is a non-cash financing activity and is reported as an increase in the\nredeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary line in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The assets and liabilities\nincluded in the condensed balance sheet below are (a) assets that can either be used to settle obligations of the VIE or be\nmade available in the future to the equity owners through dividends, distributions or in exchange of the redeemable\nownership interests (upon mutual agreement of the owners) or (b) liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to\nother assets of Nabors.\nThe condensed balance sheet of SANAD, as included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, is presented below.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 319,322 $ 281,329\nAccounts receivable 116,794 86,461\nOther current assets 14,100 12,461\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 728,137 646,215\nOther long-term assets 19,764 25,099\nTotal assets $ 1,198,117 $1,051,565\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 103,515 $ 88,432\nAccrued liabilities 20,895 10,301\nOther liabilities 49,231 38,524\nTotal liabilities $ 173,641 $ 137,257\nNote 4 Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements\nThe Company entered into an accounts receivable sales agreement (the “A/R Sales Agreement”) and an accounts\nreceivable purchase agreement (the “A/R Purchase Agreement,” and, together with the A/R Sales Agreement, the “A/R\nAgreements”). As part of the A/R Agreements, the Company continuously sells designated eligible pools of receivables as\nthey are originated by it and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries to a separate, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity\n(“SPE”) pursuant to the A/R Sales Agreement. Pursuant to the A/R Purchase Agreement, the SPE in turn sells, transfers,\nconveys and assigns to unaffiliated third-party financial institutions (the “Purchasers”) all the rights, title and interest in and\nto its pool of eligible receivables (the “Eligible Receivables”). The sale of the Eligible Receivables qualifies for sale\naccounting treatment in accordance with ASC 860 – Transfers and Servicing. During the period of this program, cash\nreceipts from the Purchasers at the time of the sale are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statement of\ncash flows and the associated receivables are derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at the time of\nthe sale. The remaining receivables held by the SPE were pledged to secure the collectability of the sold Eligible\nReceivables. Subsequent collections on the pledged receivables, which have not been sold, will be classified as operating\ncash flows in our consolidated statement of cash flows at the time of collection. The amount of receivables pledged as\ncollateral as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is approximately $54.3 million and $67.0 million, respectively.\nIn June 2022, we entered into the Third Amendment to the A/R Purchase Agreement which extended the term of the\nA/R Purchase Agreement to August 13, 2024 and increased the commitments of the Purchasers under the A/R Purchase\n11\nTable of Contents\nAgreement from $150 million to $250 million. Subject to Purchaser approval, the commitments of the Purchasers may be\nincreased to $300 million.\nIn April 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the A/R Purchase Agreement which, among other things,\nextended the term of the A/R Purchase Agreement to the earliest of (i) April 1, 2027 and (ii) the date that is ninety (90)\ncalendar days prior to the occurrence of the maturity date under and as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.\nThe amount available for sale to the Purchasers under the A/R Purchase Agreement fluctuates over time based on the\ntotal amount of Eligible Receivables generated during the normal course of business after excluding excess concentrations\nand certain other ineligible receivables. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $146.0 million had been sold to and as\nyet uncollected by the Purchasers. As of December 31, 2023, the corresponding number was approximately $145.0 million.\nNote 5 Debt\nDebt consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\n0.75% senior exchangeable notes due January 2024 $ — $ 155,529\n5.75% senior notes due February 2025 — 474,092\n7.25% senior guaranteed notes due January 2026 — 555,902\n7.375% senior priority guaranteed notes due May 2027 700,000 700,000\n7.50% senior guaranteed notes due January 2028 389,609 389,609\n1.75% senior exchangeable notes due June 2029 250,000 250,000\n9.125% senior priority guaranteed notes due January 2030 650,000 650,000\n8.875% senior guaranteed notes due August 2031 550,000 —\n$2,539,609 $3,175,132\nLess: current portion — 629,621\nLess: deferred financing costs 36,339 33,992\nLong-term debt $2,503,270 $ 2,511,519\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we fully redeemed the $474.1 million remaining balance of the\n5.75% senior notes due February 2025 for approximately $487.0 million in cash, including principal, premium of $1.4\nmillion and $11.5 million in accrued and unpaid interest. We also fully redeemed the $555.9 million remaining balance of\nthe 7.25% senior guaranteed notes due January 2026 for approximately $568.3 million in cash, including principal,\npremium of $10.1 million and $2.4 million in accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the redemptions, we\nrecognized a $14.9 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which is included in Other, net in our\ncondensed consolidated statement of income (loss). In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nremaining balance of the 0.75% senior exchangeable notes due January 2024 were fully redeemed.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 17, 2024, Nabors Delaware amended and restated its credit agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”). Under\nthe 2024 Credit Agreement, the lenders have committed to provide to Nabors Delaware an aggregate principal amount of\nrevolving loans at any time outstanding not in excess of $350.0 million, and the issuing banks have committed to provide a\nstandalone letter of credit tranche that permits Nabors Delaware to issue reimbursement obligations under letters of credit\nin an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $125.0 million. Letters of credit issued do not\naffect revolving loan capacity and vice versa. The 2024 Credit Agreement contains a $200.0 million uncommitted\naccordion feature that can be applied to increase the commitments under either the revolving loans or the letter of credit\ntranche, or both.\nThe Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) of 2.75:1.00, and a\nminimum guarantor value, requiring the guarantors (other than the Company) and their subsidiaries to own at least 90% of\nthe consolidated property, plant and equipment of the Company. The facility matures on the earlier of (a) June 17, 2029 and\n(b) to the extent 10% or more of the respective principal amount of any of the 7.375% Senior Priority Guaranteed Notes\ndue May 2027 or 7.50% Senior Guaranteed Notes due January 2028 or 50% or more of the principal\n12\nTable of Contents\namount of the 1.75% Senior Exchangeable Notes due June 2029 remains outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the\napplicable maturity date for such indebtedness, then such 90th day.\nAdditionally, the Company is subject to covenants, which are subject to certain exceptions and include, among others,\n(a) a covenant restricting our ability to incur liens (subject to the additional liens basket of up to $150.0 million), (b) a\ncovenant restricting its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to its capital stock and to\nrepurchase certain indebtedness and (c) a covenant restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt\n(subject to the grower debt basket of up to $100.0 million). The agreement also includes a collateral coverage requirement\nthat the collateral rig fair value is to be no less than the collateral coverage threshold, as defined in the agreement. This\nrequirement includes an independent appraisal report to be delivered every 6 months following the closing date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings and $51.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under our 2024\nCredit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement at September 30,\n2024 was 8.17%. In order to make any future borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement, Nabors and certain of its\nwholly owned subsidiaries are subject to compliance with the conditions and covenants contained therein, including\ncompliance with applicable financial ratios.\nAs of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement. We expect\nto remain in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement during the twelve-month period following the\ndate of this report based on our current operational and financial projections. However, we can make no assurance of\ncontinued compliance if our current projections or material underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. If we fail to\ncomply with the covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under\nthe facility could be declared immediately due and payable.\n8.875% Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031\nOn July 22, 2024, Nabors issued $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.875% senior guaranteed notes,\nwhich are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors and certain of Nabors’ indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nInterest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes have a maturity date of August 15,\n2031.\nNote 6 Shareholders’ Equity\nCommon share warrants\nOn May 27, 2021, the Board declared a distribution of warrants to purchase its common shares (the “Warrants”) to\nholders of the Company’s common shares. Holders of Nabors common shares received two-fifths of a warrant per common\nshare held as of the record date (rounded down for any fractional warrant). Nabors issued approximately 3.2 million\nWarrants on June 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, 2.5 million Warrants\nremain outstanding and 1.1 million common shares have been issued as a result of exercises of Warrants.\nEach Warrant represents the right to purchase one common share at an initial exercise price of $166.66667 per\nWarrant, subject to certain adjustments (the “Exercise Price”). Payment of the exercise price may be in cash at this time.\nThe Exercise Price and the number of common shares issuable upon exercise are subject to anti-dilution adjustments,\nincluding for share dividends, splits, subdivisions, spin-offs, consolidations, reclassifications, combinations, noncash\ndistributions, cash dividends (other than regular quarterly cash dividends not exceeding a permitted threshold amount),\ncertain pro rata shares repurchases, and similar transactions, including certain issuances of common shares (or securities\nexercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for common shares) at a price (or having a conversion price) that is less\nthan 95% of the market price of the common shares. The Warrants expire on June 11, 2026, but the expiration date may be\naccelerated at any time by the Company upon 20-days’ prior notice. The Warrants are traded on the over-the-counter\nmarket.\nThe Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, the Company\nrecognizes the Warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting\nperiod. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value\nis recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair\n13\nTable of Contents\nvalue of the Warrants was approximately $13.4 million and $25.9 million, respectively. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, approximately $2.9 million and $12.5 million of gain has been recognized for the change in the\nliability and included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss), respectively. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, approximately $7.9 million of loss and $44.3 million of gain has been recognized for\nthe change in the liability and included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss), respectively.\nNote 7 Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the\ninputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market-corroborated, or generally unobservable.\nWe primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best information\navailable. Accordingly, we employ valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nThe use of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for fair value determinations in situations where there is little, if\nany, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. We are able to classify fair value balances utilizing a\nfair value hierarchy based on the observability of those inputs.\nUnder the fair value hierarchy:\n● Level 1 measurements include unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active\nmarket;\n● Level 2 measurements include quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that have\nbeen adjusted for items such as effects of restrictions for transferability and those that are not quoted but are\nobservable through corroboration with observable market data, including quoted market prices for similar assets;\nand\n● Level 3 measurements include those that are unobservable and of a subjective nature.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nOur financial assets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 consisted of short-term investments and restricted cash held in trust. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, there were no transfers of our financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2 measures. Our financial assets are\nclassified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our restricted cash held in trust was carried at fair market value and totaled\n$328.0 million and $315.5 million, respectively, and consisted of Level 1 measurements. Our short-term investments were\nprimarily held at fair market value and totaled $7.7 million and $12.7 million, respectively and primarily consisted of Level\n2 measurements. No material Level 3 measurements existed for our financial assets for any of the periods presented.\nOur financial liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 consisted of the Warrants and are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Warrants were carried at fair\nmarket value using their trading price and totaled $13.4 million and $25.9 million, respectively.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe applied fair value measurements to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis, which\nconsist of measurements primarily related to equity method investments, other long-lived assets and assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in a business combination. Based upon our review of the fair value hierarchy, the inputs used in these\nfair value measurements generally include Level 3 inputs but could include Level 1 and 2 inputs.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $15.4 million was recognized as an other than\ntemporary impairment related to our investment in Vast Renewables Limited (“Vast”). As Vast is a publicly traded\ncompany, the valuation assessment was based on the observable market trading price of Vast’s stock. During the third\nquarter, we determined that the fair value of our Vast investment was below carrying value for a prolonged period of time\nresulting in the impairment. This impairment has been included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of income\n(loss).\nFair Value of Debt Instruments\nWe estimate the fair value of our debt financial instruments in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The fair value of our long-\nterm debt and revolving credit facilities is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third-party\nfinancial institutions. The fair value of our debt instruments is determined using Level 2 measurements. The carrying and\nfair values of these liabilities were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\nValue Value Value Value\n(In thousands)\n0.75% senior exchangeable notes due January 2024 $ — $ — $ 155,529 $ 154,989\n5.75% senior notes due February 2025 — — 474,092 474,120\n7.25% senior guaranteed notes due January 2026 — — 555,902 535,328\n7.375% senior priority guaranteed notes due May\n2027 700,000 702,086 700,000 687,526\n7.50% senior guaranteed notes due January 2028 389,609 366,642 389,609 334,090\n1.75% senior exchangeable notes due June 2029 250,000 196,743 250,000 185,383\n9.125% senior priority guaranteed notes due January\n2030 650,000 671,268 650,000 656,871\n8.875% senior guaranteed notes due August 2031 550,000 523,523 — —\n$ 2,539,609 $ 2,460,261 $ 3,175,132 $ 3,028,307\nLess: current portion — 629,621\nLess: deferred financing costs 36,339 33,992\n$ 2,503,270 $ 2,511,519\nThe fair values of our cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables approximate their carrying values due to\nthe short-term nature of these instruments.\nNote 8 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\n,QFRPH\u00037D[\nWe operate in a number of countries and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and\nexamination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we\nbelieve are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully\nchallenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain\ncountries, if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose\na material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could change substantially.\nIn certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required\nin determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of\ncertain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance\nfor the amount we determine to be more likely than not unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for\nfuture utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the\nperiod of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations\nregarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash\nflow. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable\n15\nTable of Contents\nincome in the future that will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized. However, it is possible\nthat some of our recognized deferred tax assets, relating to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, could expire\nunused or could carryforward indefinitely without utilization. Therefore, unless we are able to generate sufficient taxable\nincome from our component operations, a substantial valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets may be\nrequired, which would materially increase our tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and materially\nadversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.\n/LWLJDWLRQ\nNabors and its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. We estimate the range of our liability related to pending litigation when we believe the amount and range of loss\ncan be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. When a liability is probable\nand there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related\nto the lawsuits or claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our\npending litigation and claims and revise our estimates. Due to uncertainties related to the resolution of lawsuits and claims,\nthe ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates. For matters where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and\nsignificant, we disclose the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at the\ntime of disclosure. In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided, our ultimate exposure with\nrespect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial\nposition or cash flows, although they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular\nreporting period.\nIn March 2011, the Court of Ouargla entered a judgment of approximately $21.4 million (at September 30, 2024\nexchange rates) against us relating to alleged violations of Algeria’s foreign currency exchange controls, which require that\ngoods and services provided locally be invoiced and paid in local currency. The case relates to certain foreign currency\npayments made to us by CEPSA, a Spanish operator, for wells drilled in 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the total\ncontract amount was paid offshore in foreign currency, and approximately $3.2 million was paid in local currency. The\njudgment includes fines and penalties of approximately four times the amount at issue. We have appealed the ruling based\non our understanding that the law in question applies only to resident entities incorporated under Algerian law. An\nintermediate court of appeals upheld the lower court’s ruling, and we appealed the matter to the Supreme Court. On\nSeptember 25, 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict against us, and the case was reheard by the Ouargla Court\nof Appeals on March 22, 2015 in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion. On March 29, 2015, the Ouargla Court of Appeals\nreinstated the initial judgment against us. We appealed this decision again to the Supreme Court, which again overturned\nthe appeals court’s decision. The case was moved back to the court of appeals, which, once again, reinstated the verdict,\nfailing to abide by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Accordingly, we are appealing once more to the Supreme Court to try to get\na final ruling on the matter. While our payments were consistent with our historical operations in the country, and, we\nbelieve, those of other multinational corporations there, as well as interpretations of the law by the Central Bank of Algeria,\nthe ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a loss of up to $13.4 million in excess of amounts accrued.\n2II\u0010%DODQFH\u00036KHHW\u0003$UUDQJHPHQWV\u0003 ,QFOXGLQJ\u0003*XDUDQWHHV\nWe are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as “off-balance sheet\narrangements” that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital\nresources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements include the A/R Facility (see Note 4—Accounts\nReceivable Purchase and Sales Agreements) and certain agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or\nperformance assurance to third parties. Certain of these financial or performance assurances serve as guarantees, including\nstandby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers’ compensation insurance\nprogram and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve\nas guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer\nagent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due\nunder our indemnification guarantees.\n16\nTable of Contents\nManagement believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses\nassociated with any of these guarantees is remote.

We have granted and expect to continue to grant to employees restricted stock grants that contain nonforfeitable\nrights to dividends. Such grants are considered participating securities under ASC 260. As such, we are required to include\nthese grants in the calculation of our basic earnings (losses) per share and calculate basic earnings (losses) per share using\nthe two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that\ndetermines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared\nand participation rights in undistributed earnings. The participating security holders are not contractually obligated to share\nin losses. Therefore, losses are not allocated to the participating security holders.\nBasic earnings (losses) per share is computed utilizing the two-class method and is calculated based on the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.\nDiluted earnings (losses) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common\nequivalent shares outstanding during the periods utilizing the two-class method for stock options and unvested restricted\nshares and the if-converted method for the 1.75% senior exchangeable notes due June 2029 as the instrument contains a\nprovision for share settlement.\nA reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (losses) per share computations\nis as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nBASIC EPS:\nNet income (loss) (numerator):\nIncome (loss), net of tax $(33,087) $(31,244) $ (55,118) $ 46,047\nLess: net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (22,738) (17,672) (67,295) (41,128)\nLess: deemed dividends to SPAC public shareholders — (823) — (8,180)\nLess: accrued distribution on redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary (7,363) (7,517) (21,929) (22,307)\nNumerator for basic earnings per share:\nAdjusted income (loss), net of tax - basic $(63,188) $(57,256) $(144,342) $ (25,568)\nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding - basic 9,213 9,148 9,199 9,168\nEarnings (losses) per share:\nTotal Basic $ (6.86) $ (6.26) $ (15.69) $ (2.79)\nDILUTED EPS:\nAdjusted income (loss), net of tax - diluted $(63,188) $(57,256) $(144,342) $ (25,568)\nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding - diluted 9,213 9,148 9,199 9,168\nEarnings (losses) per share:\nTotal Diluted $ (6.86) $ (6.26) $ (15.69) $ (2.79)\nFor all periods presented, the computation of diluted earnings (losses) per share excludes shares related to outstanding\nstock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of Nabors’ common shares and shares related to the\noutstanding Warrants when their exercise price or exchange price is higher than the average market\n17\nTable of Contents\nprice of Nabors’ common shares, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and because they are not considered\nparticipating securities.\nIn any period during which the average market price of Nabors’ common shares exceeds the exercise prices of the\nstock options, such stock options or warrants will be included in our diluted earnings (losses) per share computation using\nthe if-converted method of accounting. Restricted stock is included in our basic and diluted earnings (losses) per share\ncomputation using the two-class method of accounting in all periods because such stock is considered participating\nsecurities. For periods in which we experience a net loss, all potential common shares have been excluded from the\ncalculation of weighted-average shares outstanding, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nThe average number of shares from options and shares related to outstanding Warrants that were excluded from diluted\nearnings (losses) per share that would potentially dilute earnings

Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially\nall of the remaining benefits from that good or service. Contract drilling revenues are recorded over time utilizing the input\nmethod based on time elapsed. The measurement of progress considers the transfer of the service to the customer as we\nprovide daily drilling services. We receive payment after the services have been performed by billing customers\nperiodically (typically monthly). However, a portion of our revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is\ntransferred at a distinct point in time such as with the sale of our top drives and other capital equipment. Within our drilling\ncontracts, we have identified one performance obligation in which the transaction price is allocated.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by geographical region.

We recognize a contract asset or liability when we transfer goods or services to a\ncustomer and bill an amount which differs from the revenue allocated to the related performance obligations.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences\nresult in receivables, contract assets, or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nIn general, we receive payments from customers based on dayrates as stipulated in our contracts (e.g., operating rate,\nstandby rate, etc.). The invoices billed to the customer are based on the varying rates applicable to the operating status on\neach rig. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.\nDayrate contracts also may contain fees charged to the customer for up-front rig modifications, mobilization and\ndemobilization of equipment and personnel. These fees are associated with contract fulfillment activities, and the related\nrevenue (subject to any constraint on estimates of variable consideration) is allocated to a single performance obligation\nand recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract. Mobilization fees are generally billable to the customer in the\ninitial phase of a contract and generate contract liabilities until they are recognized as revenue. Demobilization fees are\ngenerally received at the end of the contract and generate contract assets when they are recognized as revenue prior to\nbecoming receivables from the customer.\nWe receive reimbursements from our customers for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other\nservices provided at their request. Reimbursable revenues are variable and subject to uncertainty as the amounts received\nand timing thereof are dependent on factors outside of our influence. Accordingly, these revenues are constrained and not\nrecognized until the uncertainty is resolved, which typically occurs when the related costs are incurred on behalf of the\ncustomer. We are generally considered a principal in these transactions and record the associated revenues at the gross\namounts billed to the customer.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe opening and closing balances of our receivables, contract assets and current and long-term contract liabilities are\nas follows:\nContract Contract Contract Contract\nContract Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities\nReceivables (Current) (Long-term) (Current) (Long-term)\n(In thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2023 $397,051 $ 8,434 $ 2,980 $20,295 $ 1,969\nAs of September 30, 2024 $431,925 $18,331 $ 6,057 $24,617 $ 1,918\nApproximately 71% of the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period is expected to be recognized as\nrevenue during 2024, of which 53% was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 14% is\nexpected to be recognized during 2025. The remaining 15% of the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period\nis expected to be recognized as revenue during 2026 or thereafter.\nAdditionally, 69% of the contract asset balance at the beginning of the period is expected to be recognized as expense\nduring 2024, of which 60% was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 21% is expected to be\nrecognized during 2025. The remaining 10% of the contract asset balance at the beginning of the period is expected to be\nrecognized as expense during 2026 or thereafter. This disclosure does not include variable consideration allocated entirely\nto a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single\nperformance obligation.\nNote 13 Special Purpose Acquisition Company\nNabors Energy Transition Corp. II (“NETC II”) is our SPAC co-sponsored by Nabors and Greens Road Energy II LLC.\nGreens Road Energy II LLC is owned by certain members of Nabors’ management team and board members. In July 2023,\nNETC II completed its initial public offering of 30,500,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of\napproximately $305.0 million. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, NETC II completed the private sale of an\naggregate of 9,540,000 warrants for an aggregate value of $9.5 million and issued unsecured promissory notes for an\naggregate amount of $3.1 million. As part of the initial public offering of NETC II and subsequent private placement\nwarrant transactions, $308.1 million was deposited in an interest-bearing U.S. based trust account (“Trust Account”) on\nJuly 18, 2023.\nThe SPAC’s funds held in a Trust Account are invested in money market funds meeting certain conditions under\nRule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invests only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The\nfunds in the Trust Account will only be released to the SPAC upon completion of a business combination or in connection\nwith redemptions of any of the redeemable common shares, except with respect to interest earned on the funds which may\nbe withdrawn to pay the SPAC’s taxes.\nThe company accounts for the non-controlling interest in the SPAC as subject to possible redemption in accordance\nwith FASB ASC Topic 480 “'LVWLQJXLVKLQJ\u0003/LDELOLWLHV\u0003IURP\u0003(TXLW\\.” The SPAC’s common stock features certain\nredemption rights, which are considered to be outside the company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future\nevents. Nabors will recognize any future changes in redemption value immediately as they occur – i.e., adjusting the\ncarrying amount of the instrument to its current redemption amount at each reporting period.\nThe SPAC is a consolidated VIE included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under Restricted cash\nheld in trust and Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nTrust Account balance and non-controlling interest subject to possible redemption was $328.0 million and $315.5 million,\nrespectively. NETC II’s non-controlling interest subject to possible redemption is presented at full redemption value as\nmezzanine equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes NETC II’s effects on changes in non-controlling interest subject to possible\nredemption.\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nBalance, beginning of year $ 315,488 $ —\nInitial public offering — 294,474\nNet earnings 12,521 3,214\nNabors deemed dividends to SPAC public shareholders — 5,583\nNoncontrolling interest deemed dividends to SPAC public shareholders — 7,993\nBalance as of September 30 $ 328,009 $ 311,264\nNote 14 Subsequent Event\nOn October 14, 2024, we and certain subsidiaries of ours entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”)\nto acquire Parker Drilling Company (“Parker”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth\ntherein, we will acquire Parker for 4.8 million of our common shares, subject to a collar. The precise number of shares to be\nissued to Parker stockholders will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of Nabors common shares\non the NYSE for the 15 trading days ending the fifth day before the closing of the merger (“Closing Price”) and, if that\nClosing Price is below $42.70, Parker stockholders will also receive a cash component for their shares of Parker stock. If\nthe volume weighted average price is above $99.62, the merger consideration will consist of the number of shares equal to\n$478,176,000 divided by the Closing Price.\nParker provides drilling services across global energy markets. Through its Quail Tools subsidiary, Parker is the\nleading rental provider of high-performance downhole tubulars in the U.S. market. Internationally, Parker provides tubular\nrentals and repair services, with state-of-the-art facilities located in key geographies. Parker offers differentiated, casing and\ntubular running services in the U.S., the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its portfolio also includes a fleet of 17\ndrilling rigs in the U.S. and international markets, as well as Operations & Maintenance services primarily\nin Canada and Alaska.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of\nrequired regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino\nAct.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nWe often discuss expectations regarding our future markets, demand for our products and services, and our\nperformance in our annual, quarterly and current reports, press releases, and other written and oral statements. Statements\nrelating to matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor\nprovisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of oil or natural gas, that has\na material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nThe above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive but highlights certain factors that we\nbelieve are important for your consideration. For a more detailed description of risk factors that may affect us or our\nindustry, please refer to Item 1A. —\u00035LVN\u0003)DFWRUV in our 2023 Annual Report.\nManagement Overview\nThis section is intended to help you understand our results of operations and our financial condition. This information\nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements\nand the accompanying notes thereto.\nWe are a leading provider of advanced technology for the energy industry. With operations in over 15 countries,\nNabors has established a global network of people, technology and equipment to deploy solutions that deliver safe, efficient\nand sustainable energy production. By leveraging its core competencies, particularly in drilling, engineering, automation,\ndata science and manufacturing, Nabors aims to innovate the future of energy and enable the transition to a lower carbon\nworld.\nOutlook\nThe demand for our services and products is a function of the level of spending by oil and gas companies for\nexploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a\nlarge extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly, are highly volatile and tend to be\nhighly sensitive to factors including supply and demand cycles and geopolitical uncertainties particularly those impacting\nlarge hydrocarbon-producing countries. Certain oil and gas companies may also intentionally limit their capital spending as\nthey focus on generating returns to shareholders as opposed to maximizing hydrocarbon production. Additionally, there has\nrecently been an increasing number of customer consolidations within the industry especially in the United States. In some\ncases, these transactions may have an impact on overall rig demand, as the acquiring company may apply criteria that\nresults in a different level of demand for drilling rigs than the previous two companies would have had on a stand-alone\nbasis.\nSince late 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of 2024, global energy commodity markets have experienced\nhigh levels of volatility. In the U.S., operators generally reacted to these market conditions by reducing their drilling\nactivity. Recent production actions announced by certain large international oil producers have been supportive of both oil\nprices and oil-focused activity broadly, especially in international markets. Natural gas prices, particularly in the United\nStates, declined significantly through 2023 and into 2024, to levels which largely persisted through the third quarter of\n2024 and which have caused operators to reduce natural gas directed activity.\nIn early 2023 economic sentiment was overshadowed by a pervasive concern that a global recession would take hold.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s tightening of interest rates reduced capital availability in the U.S energy market. As these\nhigher interest rates continued, rig counts in the U.S. Lower 48 continued to decline throughout the year. More recently, the\nU.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates. The impact of that decision should become evident in the coming quarters.\nDespite the reduction in rig count, rig pricing discipline remained intact, generally supportive of rig dayrates and daily rig\nmargins.\nU.S. oil and gas production has proved resilient thus far in 2024 in the face of reduced drilling activity. Internationally,\nwe generally see an expansion of production capacity as well as the widespread development of unconventional resources\ndriving an expected increase in oilfield activity broadly across those markets.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\n2024 Credit Agreement\nOn June 17, 2024, Nabors Delaware amended and restated its’ credit agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”).\nUnder the 2024 Credit Agreement, the lenders have committed to provide to Nabors Delaware up to $350.0 million in\nrevolving loans, and the issuing banks have committed to provide a standalone letter of credit tranche that permits Nabors\nDelaware to issue reimbursement obligations under letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of\n$125.0 million. Letters of credit issued will not affect revolving loan capacity and vice versa. The 2024 Credit Agreement\ncontains a $200.0 million uncommitted accordion feature that can be applied to increase the commitments under either the\nrevolving loans or the letter of credit tranche, or both. The facility matures on the earlier of (a) June 17, 2029 and (b) to the\nextent 10% or more of the respective principal amount of any of the 7.375% Senior Priority Guaranteed Notes due May\n2027 or 7.50% Senior Guaranteed Notes due January 2028 or 50% or more of the principal amount of the 1.75% Senior\nExchangeable Notes due June 2029 remains outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the applicable maturity date for\nsuch indebtedness, then such 90th day.\n8.875% Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031\nOn July 22, 2024, Nabors issued $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.875% senior guaranteed notes,\nwhich are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors and certain of Nabors’ indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nInterest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes have a maturity date of August 15,\n2031. Nabors used the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to redeem all of its 7.25% senior guaranteed notes due\nJanuary 2026.\nAcquisition of Parker Drilling Company\nOn October 14, 2024, we and certain subsidiaries of ours entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”)\nto acquire Parker Drilling Company (“Parker”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth\ntherein, we will acquire Parker for 4.8 million of our common shares, subject to a collar. The precise number of shares to be\nissued to Parker stockholders will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of Nabors common shares\non the NYSE for the 15 trading days ending the fifth day before the closing of the merger (“Closing Price”) and, if that\nClosing Price is below $42.70, Parker stockholders will also receive a cash component for their shares of Parker stock. If\nthe volume weighted average price is above $99.62, the merger consideration will consist of the number of shares equal to\n$478,176,000 divided by the Closing Price.\nParker provides drilling services across global energy markets. Through its Quail Tools subsidiary, Parker is the\nleading rental provider of high-performance downhole tubulars in the U.S. market. Internationally, Parker provides tubular\nrentals and repair services, with state-of-the-art facilities located in key geographies. Parker offers differentiated, casing and\ntubular running services in the U.S., the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its portfolio also includes a fleet of 17\ndrilling rigs in the U.S. and international markets, as well as Operations & Maintenance services primarily\nin Canada and Alaska.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of\nrequired regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino\nAct.\nComparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOperating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $731.8 million, representing a decrease of\n$2.2 million, or 0%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For a more detailed description of operating\nresults, see Segment Results of Operations below.\nNet loss attributable to Nabors totaled $55.8 million ($6.86 per diluted share) for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to a net loss attributable to Nabors of $48.9 million ($6.26 per diluted share) for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, or a $6.9 million increase in net loss. The increase in net loss is primarily related to\nhigher interest expense of $11.3 million and higher other, net of $6.1 million offset by an improvement in adjusted\n27\nTable of Contents\noperating income of $16.1 million for our segments from the prior year. See below for further discussion on each of these\nincome statement items.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $64.0 million,\nrepresenting an increase of $1.8 million, or 3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is reflective\nof increases in workforce costs, general operating costs and inflationary pressures as market conditions have improved.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $159.2 million,\nrepresenting a decrease of $2.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is a result of\nlower capital expenditures over recent years coupled with a higher amount of older assets reaching the end of their useful\nlives.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\n(In thousands, except percentages and rig activity)\nU.S. Drilling\nOperating revenues $ 254,773 $ 276,385 $ (21,612) (8)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 41,694 $ 49,582 $ (7,888) (16)%\nAverage rigs working (2) 74.0 80.4 (6.4) (8)%\nInternational Drilling\nOperating revenues $ 368,594 $ 344,780 $ 23,814 7%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 32,182 $ 9,862 $ 22,320 226%\nAverage rigs working (2) 84.7 77.2 7.5 10%\nDrilling Solutions\nOperating revenues $ 79,544 $ 72,831 $ 6,713 9%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 29,231 $ 25,341 $ 3,890 15%\nRig Technologies\nOperating revenues $ 45,809 $ 61,437 $ (15,628) (25)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 2,761 $ 4,995 $ (2,234) (45)%\n(1) Adjusted operating income (loss) is our measure of segment profit and loss.

For example, one rig operating 45\ndays during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter. On an annual period, one rig\noperating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year.\nU.S. Drilling\nOperating revenues for our U.S. Drilling segment decreased by $21.6 million or 8% during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to a decrease in activity as reflected by\nan 8% decrease in the average number of rigs working, while pricing remained stable.\nInternational Drilling\nOperating revenues for our International Drilling segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024\nincreased by $23.8 million or 7% compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to\na 10% increase in the average rigs working, reflecting increased drilling activity as market conditions and demand for our\ninternational drilling services have increased since the prior year.\n28\nTable of Contents\nDrilling Solutions\nOperating revenues for this segment increased by $6.7 million or 9% during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period as an increase in demand for our international and third-party\nservices offset a decline in results in the U.S. markets, which was driven by the reduction in drilling activity.\nRig Technologies\nOperating revenues for our Rig Technologies segment decreased by $15.6 million or 25% during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period due to the overall decline in activity in the U.S.\nas mentioned previously. Adjusted operating income was relatively flat despite the 25% drop in operating revenues, due to\na change in mix of business focusing more on the higher margin product lines.\nOther Financial Information\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $55.4 million, representing an increase of $11.3\nmillion, or 26%, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our\neffective interest rate levels on our outstanding debt throughout the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOther, net\nOther, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of $41.6 million compared to $35.5 million loss\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023 representing a $6.1 million decrease in income. During the three months\nended September 30, 2024, the amount consisted of $3.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses, $6.0 million in loss\non sales of assets, $15.4 million in other than temporary impairment on securities and $12.3 million of loss recognized for\ndebt buybacks which was offset by $2.9 million of mark-to-market gains on the common share warrants. In comparison,\nthe amount during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of $13.7 million from increases in\nlitigation reserves, $7.6 million from mark-to-market losses on the common share warrants, $7.1 million in losses on sales\nand disposals of long-lived assets and $4.9 million in foreign currency transaction losses.\nIncome tax\nOur worldwide tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $10.1 million compared to $10.5\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense was primarily attributable to the\nchange in amount and geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings (losses).\nThe Organization Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\n(“BEPS”) Pillar 2 rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Several legal entities in the Nabors’ group have\nenacted Pillar 2 legislation effective January 1, 2024. The enactment of this legislation results in application of the global\nminimum tax to certain of our legal entities and their subsidiaries. The enactment of Pillar 2 did not have a material impact\nto our worldwide tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nComparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOperating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2.2 billion, representing a decrease of\n$79.9 million, or 4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For a more detailed description of operating\nresults, see Segment Results of Operations below.\nNet loss attributable to Nabors totaled $122.4 million ($15.69 per diluted share) for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to a net income attributable to Nabors of $4.9 million ($2.79 loss per diluted share) for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, or a $127.3 million decrease in net income. The decrease in net income\nattributable to Nabors is partially due to a decline in U.S. activity which has resulted in a decrease of approximately $16.7\nmillion in adjusted operating income for our segments from the prior year. In addition, interest expense increased\n29\nTable of Contents\nby $21.9 million and other, net deteriorated by $78.4 million. See below for further discussion on each of these income\nstatement items.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $187.9 million,\nrepresenting an increase of $0.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is reflective of\nincreases in workforce costs, general operating costs and inflationary pressures as market conditions have improved.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $477.1 million,\nrepresenting a decrease of $7.0 million, or 1%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is a\nresult of the limited capital expenditures over recent years coupled with a higher amount of older assets reaching the end of\ntheir useful lives.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\n(In thousands, except percentages and rig activity)\nU.S. Drilling\nOperating revenues $ 786,485 $ 941,867 $ (155,382) (16)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 137,308 $ 210,859 $ (73,551) (35)%\nAverage rigs working (2) 75.9 89.7 (13.8) (15)%\nInternational Drilling\nOperating revenues $ 1,074,686 $ 1,002,478 $ 72,208 7%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 78,330 $ 22,226 $ 56,104 252%\nAverage rigs working (2) 83.4 76.9 6.5 8%\nDrilling Solutions\nOperating revenues $ 238,079 $ 224,729 $ 13,350 6%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 83,443 $ 80,830 $ 2,613 3%\nRig Technologies\nOperating revenues $ 145,511 $ 183,481 $ (37,970) (21)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) $ 11,830 $ 13,741 $ (1,911) (14)%\n(1) Adjusted operating income (loss) is our measure of segment profit and loss.

The enactment of Pillar 2 did not have a material impact\nto our worldwide tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and investments, availability under the 2024 Credit Agreement and cash\ngenerated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and short-term investments of $459.3 million and\nworking capital of $500.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion,\nwhich included proceeds from our offering of $650.0 million in aggregate principal of 9.125% senior priority guaranteed\nnotes due 2030 that were used primarily to retire certain outstanding indebtedness during the first quarter of 2024 and\nworking capital of $431.7 million.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOn September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings and $51.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under the 2024 Credit\nAgreement, which has a total borrowing capacity of $350.0 million and a separate letter of credit tranche that permits us to\nissue letters of credit with total reimbursement obligations not to exceed $125 million. Letters of credit issued do not affect\nrevolving loan capacity and vice versa.\nThe 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense of 2.75:1.00)\nand a minimum guarantor value, requiring the guarantors (other than the Company) and their subsidiaries to own at least\n90% of the consolidated property, plant and equipment of the Company. Additionally, the Company is subject to certain\ncovenants (which are subject to certain exceptions) and include, among others, (a) a covenant restricting our ability to incur\nliens (subject to the additional liens basket of up to $150.0 million, among other exceptions), (b) a covenant restricting its\nability to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to its capital stock and to repurchase certain indebtedness,\nand (c) a covenant restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt (subject to the grower debt basket of\nup to $100.0 million).

If we fail to perform our obligations under the covenants, the revolving credit\ncommitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under the facilities\ncould be declared immediately due and payable. If necessary, we have the ability to manage our covenant compliance by\ntaking certain actions including reductions in discretionary capital or other types of controllable expenditures, monetization\nof assets, amending or renegotiating the revolving credit agreement, accessing capital markets through a variety of\nalternative methods, or any combination of these alternatives. We expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under\nthe 2024 Credit Agreement during the twelve-month period following the date of this report based on our current\noperational and financial projections, including after giving effect to the Merger. However, we can make no assurance of\ncontinued compliance if our current projections or material underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. If we fail to\ncomply with the covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under\nthe facility could be declared immediately due and payable.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior\nunsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to\naccess these markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future,\nwe believe that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment\nobligation that might arise upon maturity, exchange or purchase of our notes and our debt facilities, loss of availability of\nour revolving credit facilities and our A/R Agreements (see—Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements,\nbelow), and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash obligations, would not ultimately have a material\nadverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. The major U.S. credit rating agencies have previously downgraded\nour senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and any further ratings downgrades could adversely\nimpact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post\nletters of credit for certain obligations.\nWe had 9 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of September 30, 2024. Availability under these facilities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 was as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n(In thousands)\nCredit available $ 353,667\nLess: Letters of credit outstanding, inclusive of financial and performance guarantees 125,670\nRemaining availability $ 227,997\nAccounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements\nOn September 13, 2019, we entered into an accounts receivables sales agreement (the “A/R Sales Agreement”) and an\naccounts receivables purchase agreement (the “A/R Purchase Agreement” and, together with the A/R Sales Agreement, the\n“A/R Agreements”), whereby the originators, all of whom are our subsidiaries, sold or contributed, and\n32\nTable of Contents\nwill on an ongoing basis continue to sell or contribute, certain of their domestic trade accounts receivables to a wholly-\nowned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (“SPE”). The SPE in turn, sells, transfers, conveys and assigns to third-\nparty financial institutions (“Purchasers”), all the rights, title and interest in and to its pool of eligible receivables.\nOver the term of the facility, we entered into a number of amendments. Most recently, on April 1, 2024, we entered\ninto the Fourth Amendment to the A/R Purchase Agreement, which among other things, extended the term of the A/R\nPurchase Agreement to the earliest of (i) April 1, 2027 and (ii) the date that is ninety (90) calendar days prior to the\noccurrence of the maturity date under and as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.\nThe amount available for purchase under the A/R Agreements fluctuates over time based on the total amount of\neligible receivables generated during the normal course of business after excluding excess concentrations and certain other\nineligible receivables. The maximum purchase commitment of the Purchasers under the A/R Agreements is $250.0 million\nand the amount of receivables purchased by the third-party Purchasers as of September 30, 2024 was $146.0 million.\nThe originators, Nabors Delaware, the SPE, and the Company provide representations, warranties, covenants and\nindemnities under the A/R Agreements and the Indemnification Guarantee. See further details at Note 4—Accounts\nReceivable Purchase and Sales Agreements.\nOther Indebtedness\nSee Note 5—Debt, for further details about our financing arrangements, including our debt securities.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nOur current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity or debt issuances, the\nA/R Agreements and the facilities under our 2024 Credit Agreement are expected to adequately finance our purchase\ncommitments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we can make no assurances that our current operational and\nfinancial projections will prove to be correct. A sustained period of highly depressed oil and natural gas prices could have a\nsignificant effect on our customers’ capital expenditure spending and therefore our operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nPurchase commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately $269.3 million, primarily for capital\nexpenditures, other operating expenses and purchases of inventory. We can reduce planned expenditures if necessary or\nincrease them if market conditions and new business opportunities warrant it. The level of our outstanding purchase\ncommitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months represent a number of capital\nprograms that are currently underway or planned.\nSee our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results\nof operations or cash flows in future periods included below under “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including\nGuarantees).”\nThere have been no material changes to the contractual cash obligations that were included in our 2023 Annual Report.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for\nequity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or\nexchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and\nother factors and may involve material amounts.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration,\ndevelopment and production activities. Sustained decreases in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material impact\non these activities and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of\ndiscretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and sales of investments, dividends, loans, issuances and\n33\nTable of Contents\nrepurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market\nconditions. We discuss our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 below.\n2SHUDWLQJ\u0003$FWLYLWLHV. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $432.5 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided of $455.9 million during the corresponding 2023 period. Operating\ncash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity. Cash from operating results (before working capital changes)\nwas $512.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $17.3 million when compared to $530.1\nmillion in the corresponding 2023 period. This was due to the decrease in activity across our business for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in working capital items such\nas collection of receivables, other deferred revenue arrangements and payments of operating payables are also significant\nfactors affecting operating cash flows and can be highly volatile in periods of increasing or decreasing activity levels.\nChanges in working capital items used $80.4 million in cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a\n$6.2 million unfavorable change as compared to the $74.2 million in cash flows used by working capital in the\ncorresponding 2023 period.\n,QYHVWLQJ\u0003$FWLYLWLHV. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $353.2 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to net cash used of $429.0 million during the corresponding 2023 period. Our primary use of\ncash for investing activities is capital expenditures for rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, and\nsustaining capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used cash for capital\nexpenditures totaling $359.9 million and $406.7 million, respectively.\n)LQDQFLQJ\u0003$FWLYLWLHV. Net cash used by financing activities totaled $662.0 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid $1.2 billion of outstanding long-term\ndebt and received proceeds of $550.0 million from the issuance of the 8.875% Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $54.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received proceeds of $250.0 million from issuance of the 1.75%\nExchangeable Notes, repaid $296.5 million of outstanding long-term debt. We received proceeds of $305.0 million from\nthe public offering of NETC II and made a distribution of $186.9 million from the Trust Account to NETC stockholders\nwho exercised their right to redemption of their shares.\nOther Matters\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\nWe are a party to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as “off-balance sheet\narrangements” that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital\nresources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements include the A/R Agreements (see —Accounts\nReceivable Purchase and Sales Agreements, above) and certain agreements and obligations under which we provide\nfinancial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these financial or performance assurances serve as\nguarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers’\ncompensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided\nindemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by\nus to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum\npayments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be\nrequired to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors:\nMaximum Amount\n2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total\n(In thousands)\nFinancial standby letters of credit and other financial surety\ninstruments $ 27,791 18,295 3,763 12,547 $ 62,396\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe may be exposed to market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as\ndiscussed in our 2023 Annual Report. There were no material changes in our exposure to market risk during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports\nfiled under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 8 — Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation for information regarding our legal proceedings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this report, the risk factors set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered when evaluating us. These risks are not the only risks we\nface. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. There\nhave been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nother than those listed in this section.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Merger\nRisk Factors Relating to Changes in the Price of Nabors Common Shares\nThe market value of Nabors common shares could be negatively affected by risks and conditions that apply to the\ncombined company, which may be different from the risks and conditions applicable to Nabors, and sales of Nabors’\nshares in connection with merger would impact the price of our common shares.\nFollowing the merger, shareholders of Nabors and former stockholders of Parker will own interests in a combined\ncompany operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current shareholders of Nabors\nand current stockholders of Parker may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company or may wish to reduce\ntheir investment in the combined company. In addition, if, following the merger, large amounts of Nabors common shares\nare sold, the price of Nabors common shares could decline.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Nabors.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond Nabors’ and Parker’s control that may prevent, delay or\notherwise materially adversely affect its completion. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, regulatory approval\nfrom the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice as required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and certain\nforeign antitrust and foreign direct investment regulatory approvals. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to\nsatisfy all of the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger. If the merger\nis not completed, our financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not\nlimited to:\n● Nabors being required to pay Parker a termination fee of $10,000,000 under certain circumstances provided in the\nmerger agreement;\n● payment of costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless\nof whether the merger is completed;\n● the focus of Nabors’ management team on the merger instead of the pursuit of other opportunities that could have\nbeen beneficial to Nabors; and\n● the potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the merger.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, Nabors may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and\nfrom its customers and employees. If the merger is not completed, Nabors cannot assure its stockholders that these risks\nwill not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect the business, financial results and stock price of Nabors.\nCompletion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Parker is a\nparty.\nThe completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Parker\nis a party. If Nabors and Parker are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their\nrights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if\nNabors and Parker are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to\nrenegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Parker or the combined company. The failure to negotiate a waiver, or\nto obtain amendments to these agreements on favorable terms, could have an adverse effect on the combined company.\nLitigation relating to the merger could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the applicable\ntransaction and/or substantial costs to us.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have\nentered into acquisition, merger, or other business combination agreements. Even if such a lawsuit is without\nmerit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An\nadverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial\ncondition.\nLawsuits that may be brought against us or our directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or\nother equitable relief, including a request to rescind parts of the Merger Agreement already implemented and\nto otherwise enjoin the parties from consummating the applicable transaction. If a plaintiff is successful in obtaining\nan injunction prohibiting completion of the applicable transaction, that injunction may delay or prevent such\ntransaction from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which may adversely affect our business,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any potential future\nlawsuits. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed\nmay adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRisk Factors Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Nabors and Parker or to effectively managed the consolidated\ncompany post-merger could adversely affect the combined company’s future results.\nThe merger involves the integration of two companies that currently operate independently. The success of the merger\nwill depend—in large part—on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits, including expected\nsynergies, cost savings, increased innovation and operational efficiencies, from combining the businesses of Nabors and\nParker. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of Nabors and Parker must be successfully integrated. This\nintegration will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the\nchallenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits\nof the merger.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n● preserving our and Parker’s relationships with our existing customers and vendors;\n● complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex combined business;\n● complexities associated with integrating the workforces of the two companies, including issues retaining\nkey management personnel at both companies;\n● potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with\nthe merger;\n● difficulty or inability to refinance the debt of the combined company or comply with the covenants\nthereof;\n● performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management’s\nattention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations; and\n● the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in\nstandards, controls, systems, procedures and policies.\nAny of these difficulties in successfully integrating the businesses of Nabors and Parker, or any delays in the\nintegration process, could adversely affect the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger\nand could adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial results, financial condition and stock price. Even if\nthe combined company is able to integrate the business operations of Nabors and Parker successfully, there can be no\nassurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, increased\ninnovation and operational efficiencies that Nabors and Parker currently expect from this integration, that these benefits\nwill be achieved within the anticipated time frame or that these benefits will match our current expectations. Following\nintegration, the combined company’s future success will depend on its ability to manage its operations, which will be\nsignificantly larger than the size of either our or Parker’s existing businesses. The failure to successfully integrate the two\ncompanies, to realize the expected benefits of the merger, or to manage the consolidated company’s operations, could have\nan adverse effect on the consolidated company.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Nabors and Parker\nfollowing the merger.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Nabors and\nParker following the merger. There are many processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that\nmust be integrated, including accounting and finance, asset management, benefits, billing, drilling data solutions, health,\nsafety and environment, human resources, maintenance, marketing, payroll and purchasing. Although Nabors and Parker\nhave assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect\nthe total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by\ntheir nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the\n37\nTable of Contents\nsavings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of\neconomies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses could result in the combined company’s taking charges\nagainst earnings following the completion of the merger, and the amount and timing of any such charges are uncertain at\npresent.\nThe combined company may not be able to utilize a portion of Nabors’ or Parker’s net operating loss carry forwards\n(“NOLs”) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal tax purposes, which could adversely affect the combined\ncompany’s net income and cash flows.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Parker had federal income tax NOLs of approximately $347.8 million, of which $243.5 million\nwill expire between 2035 and 2037, and $104.3 million have an indefinite life. As of September 30, 2024, Nabors had\nfederal income tax NOLs of approximately $559.3 million, all of which have an indefinite life. Utilization of these NOLs\ndepends on many factors, including the combined company’s future taxable income, which cannot be predicted with any\naccuracy. In addition, Section 382 of the Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may\nbe used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an “ownership change” (as determined under Section\n382). Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. An ownership change generally\noccurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the corporation’s\nstock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling\nthree-year period. For these reasons, the combined company may not be able to realize a material portion of Parker’s\nNOLs, which could result in the combined company facing increased future tax liability.\nThe due diligence process that we undertook before entering into the Merger Agreement with Parker may not have\nrevealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with merger.\nIn deciding whether to enter into the Merger Agreement, we conducted the due diligence investigation that we\ndeemed reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to the merger with Parker. When\nconducting due diligence, we were required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting,\ntechnological, governance, legal and regulatory issues. In addition to our employees, outside consultants, legal advisors\nand accountants were involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees. Despite our efforts, the results of our due\ndiligence may have not been complete and accurate or, even if complete and accurate, may have not been sufficient to\nidentify all relevant facts, which could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits we expect to achieve as a result\nof the merger with Parker and the business and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely\naffected.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nWe withheld the following shares of our common shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with\ngrants of share awards during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the distributions described below. These\nshares may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item, but were\nnot purchased as part of a publicly announced program to purchase common shares:\nApproximated\nTotal Number Dollar Value of\nof Shares Shares that May\nTotal Average Purchased as Yet Be\nNumber of Price Part of Publicly Purchased\nPeriod Shares Paid per Announced Under the\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Repurchased Share (1) Program Program (2)\nJuly 1 - July 31 1 $ 82.08 — 278,914\nAugust 1 - August 31 — $ — — 278,914\nSeptember 1 - September 30 — $ — — 278,914\n(1) Shares were withheld from employees and directors to satisfy certain tax withholding obligations due in connection\nwith grants of shares under our 2016 Stock Plan. Each of the 2016 Stock Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan for\nNon-Employee Directors provide for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations, but do not specify a\nmaximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. These shares were not purchased as part of a\npublicly announced program to purchase common shares.\n38\nTable of Contents\n(2) In August 2015, our Board authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to\n$400.0 million of our common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program was\nrenewed by the Board in February 2019. Through September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.3 million of our common\nshares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $121.1 million under this program. As of September 30, 2024,\nwe had $278.9 million that remained authorized under the program that may be used to repurchase shares. The\nrepurchased shares, which are held by our subsidiaries, are registered and tradable subject to applicable securities law\nlimitations and have the same voting, dividend and other rights as other outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2024,\nour subsidiaries held 1.2 million of our common shares.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5.

(\"Nabors\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NBR) today reported third quarter 2024 operating revenues of $732 million, compared to operating revenues of $735 million in the second quarter. The net loss attributable to Nabors shareholders for the quarter was $56 million, compared to a net loss of $32 million in the second quarter. This equates to a loss of $6.86 per diluted share, compared to a loss per diluted share of $4.29 in the second quarter. The third quarter included net charges totaling approximately $25 million, primarily reflecting the redemption premium on the 2026 notes and market adjustments on investments. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $222 million, compared to $218 million in the previous quarter.\n\n_Highlights_\n\n  * ![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=2700)\n\nDownload: [Hi Res](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=10000)\n\n\n\n\n[Previous Item](#prev \"Previous\")[Next Item](#next \"Next\")\n\n[Continue Reading](#continue)\n\n  * ![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=600)\n\n[](https://investor.nabors.com/2024-10-22-Nabors-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results#assets_3:205)\n\n[View File](https://investor.nabors.com/2024-10-22-Nabors-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results#assets_3:205) [Download File](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75835/nabors_industries_logo.jpg?w=10000)\n\n\n\n\n  * Last week, Nabors announced the signing of an agreement to acquire Parker Wellbore. Parker's lines of business include the leading franchise in U.S. tubular rentals – Quail Tools – as well as international tubular rentals, well construction services (including casing running), and drilling rigs. Parker expects to generate EBITDA of $180 million this year. Nabors has identified synergies potential at an annualized run-rate of $35 million within 12 months of closing. Nabors will acquire all of Parker's issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for 4.8 million shares of Nabors common stock, subject to a share price collar. Nabors will also assume approximately $100 million in net debt.\n  * Nabors Lower 48 rigs once again set notable performance milestones. A major operator in the Delaware Basin drilled three wells, each with four-mile laterals, utilizing a Nabors PACE®-X rig equipped with a Canrig® Sigma topdrive. Sigma's rated torque is the industry's highest and is ideal for the larger-diameter drill pipe run on these wells. The rig also employed an NDS technology package.\n  * A large operator in the Eagle Ford drilled its longest well in the basin, incorporating a lateral length of more than four miles. The lateral was drilled in a single run without the use of rotary steerable systems. The rig was a Nabors PACE®-M1000, utilizing larger-diameter drill pipe.\n  * A large operator in the Bakken completed a four-mile lateral in a single run in under 12 days, utilizing a Nabors PACE®-X rig. This well is the operator's first four-mile lateral, and the operator believes it is the quickest in the Bakken. The rig was equipped with a comprehensive package of NDS Smart technology.\n\n\n\nAnthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, \"We are excited as we move forward with our announced acquisition of Parker Wellbore. Our companies' portfolios are highly complementary. Parker's recent track record speaks for itself. Quail Tools, already the leader in its space, plays a key role as operators extend the lengths of their wellbore laterals. The transaction increases our scale, provides incremental growth and improves our leverage metrics.\n\n\"Our third quarter operating results matched our overall expectations. Higher average daily margins and an improved mix drove growth in our International Drilling segment. International growth also resulted in better performance for our Drilling Solutions segment.\n\n\"Daily margins in our International Drilling segment exceeded the $17,000 mark in the third quarter. We reached this milestone earlier than we expected. This result demonstrates the earnings power of our International segment. During the quarter we also started up previously awarded rigs. We have a path to substantial international growth with 13 rigs scheduled to deploy through early 2026 in the Middle East and Latin America. The opportunity set on top of those planned start-ups is also substantial.\n\n\"In the Lower 48 market, our leading-edge pricing remained stable, supporting daily rig margins that were essentially in line with our expectations. Our average rig count was just under the prior quarter. Although we have not yet seen the anticipated increases in gas-directed drilling or a recovery from reductions driven by E&P consolidation, we look forward to an improvement in Lower 48 drilling activity in 2025.\"\n\n_Segment Results_\n\nInternational Drilling adjusted EBITDA totaled $116.0 million, compared to $106.4 million in the second quarter. Average rig count increased to 85 from 84, driven by rig additions in Algeria and Saudi Arabia. Daily adjusted gross margin for the third quarter averaged $17,085, an increase of more than $1,000 compared to the prior quarter.\n\nThe U.S. Drilling segment reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $108.7 million, compared to $114.0 million in the second quarter. Nabors' third quarter Lower 48 average rig count totaled 68, versus 69 in the second quarter. Daily adjusted gross margin in the Lower 48 averaged $15,051, versus $15,598 in the prior quarter.\n\nDrilling Solutions adjusted EBITDA increased to $34.3 million, compared to $32.5 million in the second quarter. This growth was driven by higher revenue in international markets of approximately 8% and higher penetration of performance software on Nabors U.S. rigs.\n\nRig Technologies' adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million, versus $7.3 million in the second quarter. The decrease was spread across several business lines in the U.S., mainly capital equipment, spare parts, and energy transition.\n\n_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_\n\nAdjusted free cash flow was $18 million in the third quarter compared to $57 million in the preceding quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million, including $37 million supporting the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia. This compares to $138 million in the second quarter, including $56 million supporting the newbuilds. The third quarter included two and a half additional months of interest payments for the notes issued late last year, translating into $11.7 million of interest. The first coupon payment for the notes occurred eight months after the notes were issued. Total interest payments for the quarter were $82 million, compared to $31 million in the prior quarter.\n\nWilliam Restrepo, Nabors CFO, stated, \"Last week we signed an agreement to acquire Parker Wellbore. The transaction is well aligned with our long-term strategy. It grows our capex-light NDS business, expands our international footprint, and helps us delever Nabors. Additionally, Parker is on track to earn meaningful EBITDA this year, totaling $180 million with attractive growth. Finally, Parker comes with low debt and it generates positive cash flow. This is before targeted annual synergies of $35 million. We are excited about the addition of Parker to the Nabors platform.\n\n\"Nabors' third quarter results met our outlook. Daily adjusted gross margin in our International Drilling segment expanded by more than $1,000. We reached the $17,000 daily margin target a quarter ahead of schedule, driven by exceptional performances in Saudi Arabia and Latin America, which both increased daily margins, by $1,200 and $1,300 respectively. We have three rigs scheduled to deploy in the fourth quarter, each with attractive economics. These deployments will be somewhat offset by the 12-month suspension of three lower-margin rigs in the Kingdom.\n\n\"Strength in the international markets also led to sequential growth in our Drilling Solutions business. We experienced an increase in international casing running jobs, augmented by greater deployment of performance software products, driving the segment's gross margin above 53%.\n\n\"In our Lower 48 drilling business, pricing discipline and strict expense control maintained our average daily margin above $15,000 and in line with our forecast. We expect relative stability in the fourth quarter in both margin and rig count. Our rig count forecast is dependent on stable oil prices, a similar level of churn, and stability in the overall market.\n\n\"Our capital spending target for the fourth quarter is now $230 million, with capital expenditures for SANAD newbuilds forecast at $105 million. The resulting annual capital spending forecast for 2024 is now $600 million, including $230 million related to the SANAD newbuilds. SANAD's rig supplier has improved its performance in reaching manufacturing milestones. We now expect earlier delivery of our rigs going forward. This has accelerated approximately $40 million of newbuild capital spending into 2024. We are targeting reductions in various markets to offset this increase.\n\n\"Given the SANAD newbuild capital expenditures moving forward to 2024, the recent rig suspensions in Saudi Arabia and the slightly lower U.S. activity in the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year free cash flow to close between $100 and $130 million.\"\n\n_Outlook_\n\nNabors expects the following metrics for the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\nU.S. Drilling \n\n  * Lower 48 average rig count of approximately 68 rigs\n  * Lower 48 daily adjusted gross margin of $15,000\n  * Alaska and Gulf of Mexico combined adjusted EBITDA up approximately $1.5 million versus the third quarter, with an additional rig starting work in Alaska\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n  * Average rig count of approximately 84 rigs\n  * Daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $17,000\n\n\n\nDrilling Solutions\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $36 to $37 million\n\n\n\nRig Technologies\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $9 to $10 million\n\n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n  * Capital expenditures of $230 million, with $105 million for the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia\n  * Full-year capital expenditures of approximately $600 million, with $230 million for the SANAD newbuilds\n  * This forecast includes accelerated timelines from SANAD's rig supplier totaling an estimated $40 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n\n  * Full-year adjusted free cash flow of $100 to $130 million\n\n\n\nMr. Petrello concluded, \"The results from our International Drilling segment demonstrate the value we are building in this business. With our pending rig deployments across markets, our path to future growth is well defined. Our success is driven in large part from our advanced technology. We see the global client base increasingly embracing the benefits of our solutions.\"\n\nAbout Nabors Industries\n\nNabors Industries (NYSE: NBR) is a leading provider of advanced technology for the energy industry.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, Nabors' actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect management's estimates and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Nabors does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. \n\nNon-GAAP Disclaimer\n\nThis press release presents certain \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted operating income (loss) represents income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, investment income (loss), and other, net. Adjusted EBITDA is computed similarly, but also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. Net debt is calculated as total debt minus the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash flow, after reinvesting in the company for future growth, that could be available for paying down debt or other financing cash flows, such as dividends to shareholders. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies.\n\nEach of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and therefore should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss), net debt, and adjusted free cash flow, because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability, performance and liquidity. Securities analysts and investors also use these measures as some of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. Reconciliations of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, net debt to total debt, and adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operations, which are their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures, are included in the tables at the end of this press release. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of our outlook for Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Gross Margin or Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as the amount and significance of items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts. These special items could be meaningful.\n\nInvestor Contacts: William C.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability and performance. Securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income (loss), which is the most closely comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table set forth immediately following the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Net Income (Loss)\".  \n(4) | Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses.  \n(5) | Adjusted operating income (loss) represents net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), investment income (loss), interest expense and other, net.

These would typically include days in which operating, standby and move revenue is earned.  \n(7) | Average rigs working represents a measure of the average number of rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter. On an annual period, one rig operating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year. Average rigs working can also be calculated as rig revenue days during the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period.  \n(8) | Daily rig revenue represents operating revenue, divided by the total number of revenue days during the quarter.  \n(9) | Daily adjusted gross margin represents operating revenue less direct costs, divided by the total number of rig revenue days during the quarter.  \n(10) | The U.S. Drilling segment includes the Lower 48, Alaska, and Gulf of Mexico operating areas.  \n  \n**NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD.

We are excited to welcome Parker's highly capable team to Nabors. With Nabors' extensive global technology platform, we are confident we will extend Parker's success even further.\"\n\nSandy Esslemont, President and CEO of Parker commented, \"We believe Nabors is the ideal partner to build on Parker's 90-year reputation and performance. Parker's leading position across key product lines and geographic markets aligns neatly with the Nabors' footprint. Our portfolio and technology offerings combined with Nabors' leading drilling solutions business and strong capital structure are expected to provide significant benefits to both Nabors' and Parker's customers, investors and the industry at large.\"\n\n**_Robust Strategic and Financial Rationale_**\n\n**Materially strengthens Nabors Drilling Solutions business**\n\nThis acquisition adds a large-scale, high performance tubular rental and repairs services operation to the Nabors portfolio. Growth in wellbore lateral lengths is a key driver to increasing demand for drill pipe, both in the U.S. and in other important markets. \n\nParker's casing running business complements Nabors' own tubular services and affords the opportunity to migrate to Nabors' integrated casing running model. Nabors expects this combination will establish the industry's third largest provider, with presence in several key geographies. \n\n**Immediately additive to Free Cash Flow**\n\nThe transaction is expected to result in immediate accretion to Nabors' free cash flow. It is further expected to be increasingly accretive to valuation metrics as expense and revenue synergies are progressively realized. \n\n**Enhances scale and improves leverage metrics**\n\nOn a combined company basis, adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2024 totaled $527 million. For the full year 2024, Parker expects to generate EBITDA of $180 million. With meaningful incremental EBITDA and only $100 million in additional net debt, the transaction is projected to improve Nabors' leverage metrics. \n\n**Significant synergy potential**\n\nNabors expects to realize up to $35 million of annualized expense synergies, with the majority achieved during the first 12 months post-closing. The primary drivers of these savings include reductions in both duplicate overhead and operational expenses, as well as savings in procurement. In addition to these amounts, Nabors expects to combine its existing drill pipe rental operations in the U.S. with Quail Tools, resulting in additional efficiency savings and revenue opportunities. Nabors also plans to leverage its global operations footprint to expand Parker's international business. \n\n**_Transaction details_**\n\nThe transaction has been approved by the Nabors and Parker Boards of Directors. Nabors will acquire Parker for 4.8 million shares and the assumption of net debt totaling approximately $100 million. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, as well as shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n\n**Conference call and webcast**\n\nNabors will host a conference call to discuss the transaction. A slide presentation to accompany the conference call will be posted to Nabors' investor relations website. The call will be held on October 15, 2024, at 11:00 am CT with Anthony Petrello, Nabors' Chairman, President and CEO, William Restrepo, Nabors' CFO, and other members of Nabors' senior management team. \n\nDate: | October 15, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 11:00 a.m. CT (12:00 p.m. ET)  \n**_Dial-in-number(s):_**  \nUS Toll Free: | (888) 317-6003  \nCanada Toll Free: | (866) 284-3684  \nInternational: | (412) 317-6061  \nParticipant Elite Entry Number: | 1384453  \n  \nAbout Nabors Industries\n\nNabors Industries (NYSE: NBR) is a leading provider of advanced technology for the energy industry.

By leveraging its core competencies, particularly in drilling, engineering, automation, data science and manufacturing, Nabors aims to innovate the future of energy and enable the transition to a lower-carbon world.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, Nabors' actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect management's estimates and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Nabors does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. \n\nNon-GAAP Disclaimer\n\nThis press release may present certain \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").  Adjusted EBITDA is computed similarly, but also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. Net debt is calculated as total debt minus the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. \n\nAdjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets. Nabors' management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash flow, after reinvesting in the company for future growth, that could be available for paying down debt or other financing cash flows, such as dividends to shareholders. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies.\n\nEach of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and therefore should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, Nabors' management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss), net debt, and adjusted free cash flow, because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability and performance. Securities analysts and investors also use these measures as some of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently.  These special items could be meaningful.\n\nInvestor Contacts: William C.
