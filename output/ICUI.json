(NASDAQ:ICUI), a worldwide leader in the development, manufacture and sale of innovative medical devices, and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory, Inc.

OPF's history of innovation and consistent investment in state-of-the-art IV solutions manufacturing technologies combined with ICU Medical's differentiated IV pumps and consumables will create a valuable offering for North American customers across these complementary infusion products.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, ICU Medical will provide commercial services for the joint venture to ensure seamless operations for North American customers. Key economic terms of the joint venture include an upfront payment of approximately $200 million from OPF to ICU Medical at inception, performance-based milestones at the end of 2026, and a backend put-call option in 2030 and beyond.\n\nShuichi Takagi, President and Representative Director of OPF, commented, \"Entering the North American market has always been part of our long-term ambition, and this joint venture with ICU Medical is the perfect way to do that.\" Takagi added, \"It will allow us to bring our innovative PVC-free technologies—including admixtures, parenteral nutrition in advanced multi-chamber bags, and premix IV antibiotics—to a market with an established customer base.\"\n\n\"Otsuka's scale, experience with U.S. partnerships, and demonstrated long-term investment horizon made them the ideal partner,\" said Vivek Jain, ICU Medical's Chief Executive Officer. \"Their financial strength and dedication to portfolio expansion will provide the stability and choice the North American market needs,\" added Jain. \"Through this joint venture, we're committed to delivering clinical and economic value for ICU Medical customers and giving this critical product category the innovation and attention it deserves.\"\n\nThe North American IV solutions market has faced persistent supply chain challenges, including disruptions from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and Hurricane Helene in 2024, underscoring the urgent need for action and geographic supply chain redundancy. By partnering in this joint venture, ICU Medical and OPF will work together to pursue long-term FDA approval of overseas manufacturing sites and in the near term, seek import authorization if necessary for the U.S. market while focusing on accelerating new product development.\n\n**Investor Contacts:**\n\nBrian Bonnell, ICU Medical, Inc.949-366-2183Brian.Bonnell@icumed.com\n\nJohn Mills, ICR, Inc.646-277-1254John.Mills@icrinc.com\n\n**Media Contact:**\n\nHarrison Richards, ICU Medical, Inc.949-366-4261Harrison.Richards@icumed.com\n\n**_About_**** _Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd._****_:_**_The corporate philosophy of Otsuka is \"Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide.\" The Otsuka group of companies, whose origins date back to 1921, strives daily to achieve the philosophy by creating innovative products, improving human health, and contributing to the lives of people worldwide.
