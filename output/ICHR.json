Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n###### November 4, 2024\n\nFREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ICHR), a leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems and components for semiconductor capital equipment, today announced third quarter 2024 financial results. \n\nThird quarter 2024 highlights: \n\n  * Revenues of $211 million, above the guidance range communicated in August; \n  * Gross margin of 13.2% on a GAAP basis and 13.6% on a non‑GAAP basis; \n  * Earnings per share of $(0.08) on a GAAP basis and $0.12 on a non-GAAP basis; and \n  * Sixth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow generation. \n\n\n\n“We are pleased to report third-quarter financial results favorable to our outlook entering Q3,” commented Jeff Andreson, chief executive officer. “As we’ve progressed through the challenging business environment affecting demand for semiconductor process equipment for nearly two years, over the last few months we’ve witnessed steady strengthening in customer demand, with increased visibility for a stronger second half 2024 and a much healthier business environment for etch and deposition as we turn the corner into 2025. We are also making meaningful progress in our strategies to increase the proprietary content of our product portfolio, with continued new design wins and qualifications during the third quarter. Between the sequential increases in revenue volumes and gradual strengthening in proprietary content, we delivered incremental gross margin performance exceeding our 25% target in the third quarter, and expect to do so again in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2025, the strengthening demand environment for etch and deposition process equipment lends optimism for continued momentum driving our top-line results, and we expect continued execution of our gross margin expansion strategies will result in strong earnings leverage and cash flow dynamics as we deliver on our objective to outperform WFE (wafer fab equipment) in the coming year.” \n\n**Q3 2024** |  **Q2 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)_  \n**U.S. GAAP Financial Results:**  \nNet sales  |  $  |  211,139  |  $  |  203,227  |  $  |  196,761   \nGross margin  |  13.2  |  %  |  12.6  |  %  |  12.2  |  %   \nOperating margin  |  (0.2  |  )%  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  (2.5  |  )%   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (2,776  |  )  |  $  |  (5,112  |  )  |  $  |  (10,425  |  )   \nDiluted EPS  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.15  |  )  |  $  |  (0.36  |  )   \n  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q2 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)_  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Results:**  \nGross margin  |  13.6  |  %  |  13.0  |  %  |  13.1  |  %   \nOperating margin  |  3.0  |  %  |  2.2  |  %  |  2.2  |  %   \nNet income (loss)  |  $  |  4,020  |  $  |  1,819  |  $  |  2,097   \nDiluted EPS  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  0.05  |  $  |  0.07   \n  \n**U.S. GAAP Financial Results Overview**  \n---  \n  \nFor the third quarter of 2024, revenue was $211.1 million, net loss was $2.8 million, and net loss per diluted share (“diluted EPS”) was $(0.08). This compares to revenue of $203.2 million and $196.8 million, net loss of $5.1 million and $10.4 million, and diluted EPS of $(0.15) and $(0.36), for the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Results Overview**  \n---  \n  \nFor the third quarter of 2024, non-GAAP net income was $4.0 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.12. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05 and $0.07, for the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively. \n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Outlook**  \n---  \n  \nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $220 million to $235 million. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.01 to $0.13 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.33. \n\nThis outlook for non‑GAAP diluted EPS excludes amortization of intangible assets of approximately $2.2 million and share-based compensation expense of approximately $4.7 million, as well as the related income tax effects. Non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Results**  \n---  \n  \nWe ended the third quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $116.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $36.5 million from the prior year ended December 29, 2023. \n\nThe increase of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of $8.6 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $6.4 million. The increase of $36.5 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to net proceeds of $136.7 million from our issuance of 3.8 million ordinary shares in March 2024 in connection with an underwritten public offering and net cash provided by operating activities of $30.4 million, partially offset by net payments on credit facilities of $118.8 million and capital expenditures of $13.2 million. \n\nOur cash provided by operating activities of $8.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 consisted of net non-cash charges of $12.1 million, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of $7.6 million and share-based compensation expense of $4.7 million, partially offset by net loss of $2.8 million. Our cash provided by operating activities of $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 consisted of net non-cash charges of $33.9 million, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of $22.8 million and share-based compensation expense of $11.0 million, and a decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities of $13.4 million, partially offset by net loss of $16.9 million. \n\nThe increase in our net operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $18.9 million and an increase in inventories of $7.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $22.9 million. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities of $13.4 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of $22.7 million and a decrease in inventories of $6.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.4 million. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results**  \n---  \n  \nIn addition to U.S. GAAP (\"GAAP\") results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results, including non‑GAAP gross profit, non‑GAAP operating income, non‑GAAP net income (loss), non‑GAAP diluted EPS, and free cash flow. Management uses non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view our results from management’s perspective. Non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, and net income are defined as: gross profit, operating income (loss), or net income (loss), respectively, excluding (1) amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and discrete or infrequent charges and gains that are outside of normal business operations, including transaction-related costs, contract and legal settlement gains and losses, facility shutdown costs, and severance costs associated with reduction-in-force programs, to the extent they are present in gross profit, operating income (loss), and net income (loss), respectively; and (2) the tax impacts associated with these non-GAAP adjustments, as well as non-recurring discrete tax items, including the impact of deferred tax asset valuation allowances. All non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis; the related income tax effects, including current and deferred income tax expense, are included in the adjustment line under the heading \"Tax adjustments related to non-GAAP adjustments.\" Non-GAAP diluted EPS is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin are defined as non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating income, respectively, divided by net sales. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures. Tables showing these metrics on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with reconciliation footnotes thereto, are included at the end of this press release. \n\nNon-GAAP results have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP results differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, both of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP results as a tool for comparison. \n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider non-GAAP results alongside other financial performance measures and results presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, in evaluating non-GAAP results, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving non-GAAP results, and you should not infer from our presentation of non-GAAP results that our future results will not be affected by these expenses or other discrete or infrequent charges and gains that are outside of normal business operations. \n\n**Conference Call**  \n---  \n  \nWe will conduct a conference call to discuss our third quarter 2024 results and business outlook today at 1:30 p.m. PT. \n\nTo listen to a live webcast of the call, please visit our investor relations website at [https://ir.ichorsystems.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.ichorsystems.com&esheet=54146247&newsitemid=20241104137003&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.ichorsystems.com&index=1&md5=f200c810ba81a83107016a775f2f088b), or go to the live link at [https://www.webcast-eqs.com/register/ichor110424/en](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webcast-eqs.com%2Fregister%2Fichor110424%2Fen&esheet=54146247&newsitemid=20241104137003&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webcast-eqs.com%2Fregister%2Fichor110424%2Fen&index=2&md5=188ee056e4cd23a59afae67bad57d116). \n\nTo listen via telephone, please call (877) 407‑0989 (domestic) or +1 (201) 389‑0921 (international), conference ID: 13748960.

In the first quarter of 2024, we determined that the valuation allowance should be recognized against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets on a non-GAAP basis as we were not in a three-year cumulative U.S. income position on a non-GAAP basis.
