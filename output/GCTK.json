If you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on November 8, 2024, you may\nattend and vote at the Special Meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters to be voted on. As of November 8, 2024, there were 5,772,026 shares of\nour common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nQ: How do I vote my shares if I hold my shares through a broker rather than directly?\nA: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you\nhave the right to vote at the Special Meeting.\nIf your shares are held in a brokerage account, bank or by another nominee or trustee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street” name. In that case, the proxy materials have been\nforwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record who is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your\nbroker, bank or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the voting instructions included in the proxy materials. As the beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the Special\nMeeting, but because the beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, bank,\nnominee, or trustee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Special Meeting.\nAs indicated above, if your shares are held in “street” name by a broker, bank, or other nominee, they should send you instructions that you must follow in order to have your shares voted at the Special\nMeeting.\nIf you hold shares in your own name, you may vote by proxy in any one of the following ways:\n● Via the Internet by accessing the proxy materials on the secured website www.proxyvote.com and following the voting instructions on that website. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day\nand will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on , 2024, the day before the Special Meeting. Easy-to-follow instructions allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your\ninstructions have been properly recorded;\n● Via telephone by calling toll free 1-800-690-6903 and following the recorded instructions. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on ,\n2024, the day before the Special Meeting. Easy-to-follow instructions allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded; or\n● By completing, dating, signing and returning the proxy card. If you received the proxy card by mail and choose to vote by mail, simply mark your proxy card, date and sign it, and return it. Your\nproxy card must be received by the close of business on , 2024, the day before the Special Meeting.\nThe Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders’ identities by use of a control number to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that\nstockholders’ instructions have been properly recorded. Voting via the Internet or telephone must be completed by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on , 2024, the day before the Special Meeting. If you submit\nor return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board, as permitted by law.\n2\nQ: How will my shares be voted?\nA: All shares which are entitled to vote and represented by a properly completed, executed and delivered proxy received before the Special Meeting and not revoked will be voted at the Special Meeting as\ninstructed by you in a proxy delivered before the Special Meeting. If you do not indicate how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted “FOR” the\nIssuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, the Charter Amendment Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal, and with regard to any other matters that may be properly presented at the Special\nMeeting and all matters incident to the conduct of the meeting. All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative\nvotes, abstentions and broker non-votes.\nQ: Is my vote confidential?\nA: Yes, your vote is confidential. The only persons who have access to your vote are the inspector of election, individuals who help with processing and counting your votes, and persons who need access\nfor legal reasons. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to the Company’s management and the Board.\nQ: What is the quorum requirement for the Special Meeting?\nA: One third (1/3) of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote, as of the Record Date, must be present at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy in order for us legally to hold the Special\nMeeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. Your shares will be counted as present at the Special Meeting if you:\n● Are present and entitled to vote in person at the Special Meeting; or\n● Properly submitted a proxy card or voter instruction card.\nIf you are present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting but withhold your vote or abstain from voting on any or all proposals, your shares are still counted as present and entitled to vote for\npurposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes are not counted for determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a\nbrokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares, but the broker submits that person’s proxy nonetheless. The proposals listed in this Proxy Statement state the votes needed\nto approve the proposed actions.\nQ: What proposals will be voted on at the Special Meeting?\nA: The following proposals will be voted on at the Special Meeting:\n● The approval, for purposes of complying with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), of the full issuance of shares of common stock issuable by the Company upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and\nthe Series B Warrants (the “Issuance Proposal”);\n● The approval of an amendment to Article IV of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of between 1-for-2 and 1-for-\n20, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and with such Reverse Stock Split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined\nby the Board in its sole discretion (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal”);\n● To approve an amendment to Article IV of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000\nshares (the “Charter Amendment Proposal”); and\n● To adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if it is determined by the Company that more time is necessary or appropriate\nto approve the Issuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, and the Charter Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).\n3\nQ: What are the recommendations of the Board of Directors?\nA: The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:\n● “FOR” the Issuance Proposal;\n● “FOR” the Reverse Stock Split Proposal;\n● “FOR” the Charter Amendment Proposal; and\n● “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ: What does it mean to vote by proxy?\nA: When you vote “by proxy,” you grant another person the power to vote stock that you own. If you vote by proxy in accordance with this Proxy Statement, you will have designated proxy holders for the\nSpecial Meeting.\nAny proxy given pursuant to this solicitation and received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted in accordance with your specific instructions. If you provide a proxy, but you do not provide\nspecific instructions on how to vote on each proposal, the proxy holder will vote your shares “FOR” the Issuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, the Charter Amendment Proposal, and the\nAdjournment Proposal. With respect to any other proposal that properly comes before the Special Meeting, the proxy holders will vote in their own discretion according to their best judgment, to the\nextent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.\nQ: What are the voting rights of stockholders?\nA: Each share of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date entitles its holder to cast one vote on each matter to be voted on. No dissenters’ rights are provided under the Delaware General\nCorporation Law (the “DGCL”), our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws with respect to any of the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.\nQ: How many votes are required to approve each proposal?\nA: Issuance Proposal. The approval of the Issuance Proposal requires that a quorum exist and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting\nand entitled to vote on the subject matter be voted in favor of the Issuance Proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the Issuance Proposal. Under\napplicable Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules, brokers are not permitted to vote shares held for a customer on “non-routine” matters (such as the Issuance Proposal) without specific instructions from the\ncustomer. Therefore, broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will also have no effect on the outcome of the Issuance Proposal.\nReverse Stock Split Proposal. The approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal requires that a quorum exist and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at\nthe Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter be voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. The Reverse Stock Split Proposal is generally considered to be a “routine” matter\nwhich means that banks, brokers or other nominees will have discretionary authority to vote on this matter. Accordingly, no “broker non-votes” are expected on the Reverse Stock Split Proposal.\nAbstentions and “broker non-votes”, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote on the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. .\nCharter Amendment Proposal. The approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal requires that a quorum exist and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy\nat the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter be voted in favor of the Charter Amendment Proposal. The Charter Amendment Proposal is generally considered to be a “routine” matter\nwhich means that banks, brokers or other nominees will have discretionary authority to vote on this matter. Accordingly, no “broker non-votes” are expected on the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nAbstentions and “broker non-votes”, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote on the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nAdjournment Proposal. For the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, the number of votes cast in favor of approval of the Adjournment Proposal must represent a majority of all those outstanding\nshares that (a) are present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, and (b) are cast either affirmatively or negatively on the proposal. The Adjournment Proposal is generally considered to be a\n“routine” matter which means that banks, brokers or other nominees will have discretionary authority to vote on this matter. Accordingly, no “broker non-votes” are expected on the Adjournment\nProposal. Abstentions and “broker non-votes”, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote on the Adjournment Proposal.\n4\nQ: Can I access these proxy materials on the Internet? How long will they be available?\nA: Yes. The Notice of Special Meeting and Proxy Statement are available for viewing, printing, and downloading at www.proxyvote.com. All materials will remain posted on www.proxyvote.com at least until\nthe conclusion of the meeting.\nQ: How can I revoke or change my vote after submitting it?\nA: If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy before your shares are voted at the Special Meeting by:\n● Filing a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy with our Chief Executive Officer at Glucotrack, Inc., 301 Rte. 17 North, Ste. 800, Rutherford, New Jersey 07070, at or before\nthe taking of the vote at the Special Meeting;\n● Duly executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Chief Executive Officer at Glucotrack, Inc., 301 Rte. 17 North, Ste. 800, Rutherford, New Jersey 07070, at or\nbefore the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting;\n● Attending the Special Meeting virtually and vote your shares (although attendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy); or\n● If you voted by telephone or via the Internet, voting again by the same means prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on , 2024, the day before the Special Meeting (your latest telephone or Internet\nvote, as applicable, will be counted and all earlier votes will be disregarded).\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your bank, broker, or other holder of record. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you\nobtain a legal proxy from them and register to attend the Special Meeting as described in the answers to previous questions.\nQ: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA: We plan to announce the preliminary voting results at the Special Meeting. We will publish the results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Special\nMeeting.\nQ: Who is paying for this Proxy Statement and the solicitation of my proxy, and how are proxies solicited?\nA: Proxies are being solicited by the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting. The Company’s officers and other employees, without additional remuneration, also may assist in the solicitation of\nproxies in the ordinary course of their employment.

The Offering, including the issuance of the Common Warrants is hereinafter referred to as the “Transaction.”\nIn a private placement offering completed concurrently with the Offering (the “Concurrent Private Offering”), an existing investor, which is controlled by a director of the Company (the “Investor”),\nconverted approximately $4,093,112 of debt, which represented the then outstanding principal and accrued interest under a convertible promissory note dated July 30, 2024 (the “Debt”). The Debt was\nconverted to common stock and Common Warrants on substantially the same terms as the Offering, resulting in the issuance of 2,640,717 shares of common stock, 2,640,717 accompanying Series A Common\nWarrants, and 2,640,717 accompanying Series B Common Warrants, based on a conversion price of $1.55 per share, which is equal to the consolidated closing bid price of the common stock on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market on November 12, 2024. The common stock and the Common Warrants issued in connection with the Concurrent Private Offering are not registered under the Securities Act and were offered\npursuant to the exemption from registration provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.\nEach Series A Common Warrant has an exercise price per share of $1.81 and will be exercisable beginning on the date on which Stockholder Approval (as defined below) is received and deemed effective\n(the “Initial Exercise Date” or the “Stockholder Approval Date”). The Series A Warrants will expire on the five-year anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date. The Series B Warrants will have an exercise price\nper share of $1.81 and will be exercisable beginning on the Initial Exercise Date. The Series B Warrants will expire on the two and one-half year anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date. The issuance of Common\nWarrant Shares upon exercise of the Common Warrants is subject to stockholder approval under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) (“Stockholder Approval” and the\ndate on which Stockholder Approval is received and deemed effective, the “Stockholder Approval Date”).\n7\nThe following adjustments are contained within the Common Warrants:\na. The reduction of the Common Warrants’ exercise price to a price equal to the lesser of (i) the then exercise price and (ii) the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) during the period\ncommencing five trading days immediately preceding and the five trading days commencing on the date the Company effects a reverse stock split in the future with a proportionate increase in the number of\nshares underlying the Common Warrants;\nb. The adjustment contained within the Series A Warrants, providing for a reduction to the exercise price and a proportionate increase in the number of shares underlying the Series A Warrants upon\nissuance of the common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share that is less than the exercise price of each Series A Warrant;\nc. A reduction to the exercise price to equal the lowest of (i) the exercise price then in effect, (ii) the lowest daily VWAP for the 10-trading day period commencing on the first trading day following the\nShareholder Approval Date, and ending following the close of trading on the 10th trading day thereafter, and (iii) the lowest VWAP during the period commencing five (5) consecutive trading days\nimmediately preceding the eleventh (11th) trading day following the Stockholder Approval Date;\nd. The provision contained within the Series B Warrants providing for an alternative cashless exercise feature pursuant to which the holder of the Series B Warrant has the right to receive an aggregate\nnumber of shares of common stock equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon a cashless exercise of the Series B Warrant and (y) 3.0; and\ne. Upon the Stockholder Approval Date any Adjustment to the Warrants will be subject to a floor price of $0.28 (collectively (a)-(e), the “Adjustments” and, each an “Adjustment”).\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to call a Special Meeting of its stockholders to approve the Transaction, including, without limitation, the issuance of all of the Warrant\nShares underlying the Common Warrants issued in the Offering and Concurrent Private Offering.\nWhy We are Seeking Stockholder Approval of the Issuance Proposal\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and as a result, we are subject to Nasdaq’s Listing Rules, including Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d).\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval of transactions, other than public offerings, resulting in the issuance of greater than 20% of the outstanding common stock at a price less than\nthe “Minimum Price.” Because (i) no additional consideration was paid by the Purchaser and the Investor for the Common Warrants, and (ii) the exercise in full of the Common Warrants (including shares of\ncommon stock issuable in connection with any Adjustment), taken together with the sale of the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants to the Purchasers and Investor in the Offering and the Concurrent Private\nOffering, would have resulted in the issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) is implicated by the issuance of the Common Warrants. Accordingly,\nin order to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), the Common Warrants include a provision under which they may not be exercised until we have obtained Stockholder Approval.\nAccordingly, we are seeking stockholder approval pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) to permit the issuance of the maximum number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant to the terms of the\nCommon Warrants.\nIf the Company does not obtain stockholder approval at the Special Meeting, the Company will not be able to issue to the Purchasers and Investor the number of shares to which they would otherwise\nbe entitled upon full exercise of the Common Warrants, which could require the Company to pay substantial cash amounts in lieu of delivering those shares.\nAdditional Information\nThis summary is intended to provide you with basic information concerning the Purchase Agreement and the Common Warrants. The full texts of the Common Warrants were included as exhibits to our\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024.\nEffect on Current Stockholders if the Issuance Proposal is Approved\nEach additional share of common stock that would be issuable to the Purchasers and the Investor would have the same rights and privileges as each share of our currently outstanding common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock to the Purchasers and Investor pursuant to the terms of the Common Warrants will not affect the rights of the holders of our outstanding common stock, but such\nissuances will have a dilutive effect on the existing stockholders, including the voting power and economic rights of the existing stockholders, and may result in a decline in our stock price or greater price\nvolatility.\nIf approved, the outstanding Common Warrants are exercisable for a maximum of an aggregate of 254,303,888 shares of common stock.\n8\nEffect on Current Stockholders if the Issuance Proposal is Not Approved\nThe Company is not seeking the approval of its stockholders to authorize its entry into the Purchase Agreement or the Common Warrants, as the Company has already done so, and such documents\nalready are binding obligations of the Company . The failure of the Company’s stockholders to approve the Issuance Proposal will not negate the existing terms of the documents, which will remain binding\nobligations of the Company. If the stockholders do not approve this proposal, the Company will be required to pay the Purchasers and Investor in cash in lieu of delivering Warrant Shares.\nThe Company’s ability to successfully implement its business plans and ultimately generate value for its stockholders is dependent upon its ability to raise capital and satisfy its ongoing business needs.\nIf the Company is required to satisfy its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and the Common Warrants in cash rather than Common Stock, the Company likely will not have the capital necessary to\nfully satisfy its ongoing business needs, the effect of which will materially and adversely impact future operating results, and result in a delay in or modification or abandonment of our business plans.\nAdditionally, it may be necessary for the Company to acquire additional financing in order to satisfy its obligations under the Common Warrants in cash, which financing may not be available on\nadvantageous terms, or at all, and which in any event will result in the incurrence of additional transaction expenses.\nFurther, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, if the Company does not obtain Stockholder Approval of the Issuance Proposal at the Special Meeting, each Purchaser shall be refunded all consideration\npaid for the Common Warrants purchased by such Purchaser as promptly as practicable following the Company’s failure to obtain such Stockholder Approval.\nRequired Vote of Stockholders\nThe approval of the Issuance Proposal requires that a quorum exist, and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote\non the subject matter shall be required to approve the Issuance Proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the Issuance Proposal. Under applicable Nasdaq\nStock Market listing rules, brokers are not permitted to vote shares held for a customer on “non-routine” matters (such as the Issuance Proposal) without specific instructions from the customer. Therefore,\nbroker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will also have no effect on the outcome of the Issuance Proposal.\nRecommendation of our Board of Directors\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” APPROVAL, OF (I) THE ISSUANCE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH NASDAQ RULE 5635(D), OF\n20% OR MORE OF OUR COMMON STOCK INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF THE COMMON WARRANTS AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE COMMON WARRANTS, ANY RESULTING\nISSUANCE OF WARRANT SHARES INCLUSIVE OF THE TERMS OF THE ADJUSTMENT, PURSUANT TO THAT CERTAIN SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED NOVEMBER 13, 2024,\nBY AND BETWEEN US AND CERTAIN ACCREDITED INVESTORS AND (II) THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE SERIES A WARRANTS AND SERIES B WARRANTS:\n(A) THE REDUCTION OF THE COMMON WARRANTS’ EXERCISE PRICE TO A PRICE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (I) THE THEN EXERCISE PRICE AND (II) LOWEST VWAP DURING THE\nPERIOD COMMENCING FIVE TRADING DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING AND THE FIVE TRADING DAYS COMMENCING ON THE DATE THE COMPANY EFFECTS A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT\nIN THE FUTURE WITH A PROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING THE COMMON WARRANTS; (B) THE ADJUSTMENT CONTAINED WITHIN THE SERIES A\nWARRANTS, PROVIDING FOR A REDUCTION TO THE EXERCISE PRICE AND A PROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING THE SERIES A WARRANTS UPON\nISSUANCE OF THE COMMON STOCK OR COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AT A PRICE PER SHARE THAT IS LESS THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF EACH SERIES A WARRANT; (C) A\nREDUCTION TO THE EXERCISE PRICE TO EQUAL THE LOWEST OF (X) THE EXERCISE PRICE THEN IN EFFECT, (Y) THE LOWEST DAILY VWAP FOR THE 10-TRADING DAY PERIOD\nCOMMENCING ON THE FIRST TRADING DAY FOLLOWING THE SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL DATE, AND ENDING FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF TRADING ON THE 10TH TRADING DAY\nTHEREAFTER, AND (Z) THE LOWEST VWAP DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING FIVE (5) CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ELEVENTH (11TH) TRADING\nDAY FOLLOWING THE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL DATE; AND (D) THE PROVISION CONTAINED WITHIN THE SERIES B WARRANTS PROVIDING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CASHLESS\nEXERCISE FEATURE PURSUANT TO WHICH THE HOLDER OF THE SERIES B WARRANT HAS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AN AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK EQUAL\nTO THE PRODUCT OF (X) THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD BE ISSUABLE UPON A CASHLESS EXERCISE OF THE SERIES B WARRANT AND (Y)\n3.0. AND (III) UPON THE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL DATE ANY ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXERCISE PRICE OF AND NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING THE WARRANTS WILL BE SUBJECT\nTO A FLOOR PRICE OF $0.28.\n9\nPROPOSAL 2\nAPPROVAL OF REVERSE STOCK SPLIT\nOverview\nOur Board has determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, for us to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to authorize our Board to effect the Reverse\nStock Split (the “Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment”) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a specific ratio, ranging from one-for-two (1:2) to one-for-twenty (1:20) (the “Approved\nSplit Ratios”), to be determined by the Board. A vote for this Proposal 2 will constitute approval of the Reverse Stock Split that, once authorized by the Board and effected by filing the Reverse Stock Split\nCharter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, will combine between two and 20 shares of our common stock into one share of our common stock. If implemented, the Reverse Stock\nSplit will have the effect of decreasing the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.\nAccordingly, stockholders are asked to adopt and approve the Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment set forth in Appendix A of this Proxy Statement to effect the Reverse Stock Split as set forth in the\nReverse Stock Split Charter Amendment, subject to the Board’s determination, in its sole discretion, whether or not to implement the Reverse Stock Split, as well as the specific ratio within the range of the\nApproved Split Ratios, and provided that the Reverse Stock Split must be effected on or prior to the one-year anniversary date of the Special Meeting. The text of Appendix A remains subject to modification\nto include such changes as may be required by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and as our Board deems necessary or advisable to implement the Reverse Stock Split.\nIf adopted and approved by the holders of our outstanding voting securities, the Reverse Stock Split would be applied at an Approved Split Ratio approved by the Board prior to the one-year\nanniversary date of the Special Meeting. The Board reserves the right to elect to abandon the Reverse Stock Split if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Reverse Stock Split is no longer in the best\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders.\nPurpose and Rationale for the Reverse Stock Split\nAvoid Delisting from Nasdaq. As we have previously reported, on May 26, 2023, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that,\nbased upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days, we were not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for\ncontinued listing on Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). We had 180 days from May 26, 2023, or through November 22, 2023, to regain compliance with the Bid Price\nRule.\n10\nOn November 24, 2023, we received a second letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had been granted an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 20, 2024 (the “Extended Compliance\nPeriod”), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A).\nOn May 17, 2024, in order to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware which effected, as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, on May 17, 2024, a one-for-five reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “May Reverse Split”). Following the May\nReverse Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was proportionally reduced. The shares of common stock underlying the outstanding stock options and warrants were similarly adjusted\nalong with corresponding adjustments to their exercise prices. The May Reverse Split also proportionally reduced the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 shares to\n100,000,000 shares.\nOn May 21, 2024, we received a third letter from Nasdaq (the “Letter”) notifying us that it had not regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule during the Extended Compliance Period. The Letter also\nnotified us that our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, indicates that we no longer meet the $2,500,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth under Listing Rule\n5550(b)(1) (the “Minimum Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). Pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(d)(2), the failure to comply with the Minimum Stockholders’ Equity Requirement became an additional and\nseparate basis for delisting.\nBecause we were under review for failure to comply with the Bid Price Rule, we were not eligible to submit a plan to regain compliance. Accordingly, unless we would request an appeal of this\ndetermination by May 28, 2024, trading of our common stock would be suspended at the opening of business on May 30, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”). We timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. On\nAugust 5, 2024, we received the decision of the Panel, and they granted us an extension until November 18, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders’ Equity Requirement.\nOn November 19, 2024, the Company received a compliance letter (the “Compliance Letter”) from Nasdaq, informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders’ Equity\nRequirement. The Compliance Letter noted, that because the Company’s bid price has closed below the minimum required by the Bid Price Rule following the Offering, the Panel has determined to impose on\nthe Company a Discretionary Panel Monitor, pursuant to Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), for a period of one year from the date of the Compliance Letter, to ensure that the Company maintains long-term\ncompliance with the Minimum Stockholders’ Equity Requirement, the Bid Price Rule, and all of Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\nOur Board believes that the Reverse Stock Split is necessary to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and maintain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. Accordingly, the Board has approved\nresolutions proposing the Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment to effect the Reverse Stock Split and directed that it be submitted to our stockholders for adoption and approval at the Special Meeting.\nManagement and the Board have considered the potential harm to us and our stockholders should Nasdaq delist our common stock from trading. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common\nstock since alternatives, such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the pink sheets, are generally considered to be less efficient markets. An investor likely would find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate\nquotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an OTC market. Many investors likely would not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing OTC markets, policies preventing them from\ntrading in securities not listed on a national exchange, or other reasons.\n11\nOther reasons. The Board also believes that the increased market price of our common stock expected as a result of implementing the Reverse Stock Split could improve the marketability and liquidity of\nour common stock and may encourage interest and trading in our common stock. The Reverse Stock Split, if effected, could allow a broader range of institutions to invest in our common stock (namely, funds\nthat are prohibited from buying stock whose price is below a certain threshold), potentially increasing the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock. The Reverse Stock Split could help increase\nanalyst and broker interest in the common stock, as their policies can discourage them from following or recommending companies with low stock prices. Because of the trading volatility often associated with\nlow-priced stocks, many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers\nfrom recommending low-priced stocks to their customers. Some of those policies and practices may make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers. Additionally,\nbecause brokers’ commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, a low average price per share of our common stock\ncan result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were higher.\nOur Board does not intend for this transaction to be the first step in a series of plans or proposals to effect a “going private transaction” within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nRisks of the Proposed Reverse Stock Split\nWe cannot assure you that the proposed Reverse Stock Split will increase the price of our common stock and have the desired effect of maintaining compliance with Nasdaq’s Bid Price Rule.\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, our Board expects that it will increase the market price of our common stock so that we are able to maintain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. However, the\neffect of the Reverse Stock Split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty. The history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in similar circumstances is varied.\nIt is possible that (i) the per share price of our common stock after the Reverse Stock Split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding resulting from\nthe Reverse Stock Split, (ii) the market price per post-Reverse Stock Split share may not exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a sustained period of time, or (iii) the Reverse Stock Split\nmay not result in a per share price that would attract brokers and investors who do not trade in lower priced stocks. Even if the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, the market price of our common stock may\ndecrease due to factors unrelated to the Reverse Stock Split. In any case, the market price of our common stock will be based on other factors which may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding,\nincluding our future performance. If the Reverse Stock Split is consummated and the trading price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our\noverall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Even if the market price per post-Reverse Stock Split share of our common stock remains in excess of\n$1.00 per share, we may be delisted due to a failure to meet other continued listing requirements, including Nasdaq requirements related to the minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum number of shares that\nmust be in the public float and the minimum market value of the public float.\nA decline in the market price of our common stock after the Reverse Stock Split is implemented may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split.\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is implemented and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. The market\nprice of our common stock will, however, also be based upon our performance and other factors, which are unrelated to the number of shares of common stock outstanding.\nThe proposed Reverse Stock Split may decrease the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of our common stock may be harmed by the proposed Reverse Stock Split given the reduced number of shares of common stock that would be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split,\nparticularly if the stock price does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n12\nDetermination of the Ratio for the Reverse Stock Split\nIf Proposal 2 is approved by stockholders and the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to move forward with the Reverse Stock Split, the Approved Split\nRatio will be selected by the Board, in its sole discretion. However, the Approved Split Ratio will not be less than a ratio of one-for-two (1:2) or exceed a ratio of one-for-20 (1:20). In determining which\nApproved Split Ratio to use, the Board will consider numerous factors, including the historical and projected performance of our common stock, the effect of the Approved Split Ratio on our compliance with\nother Nasdaq listing requirements, prevailing market conditions and general economic trends, and will place emphasis on the expected closing price of our common stock in the period following the\neffectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. The Board will also consider the impact of the Approved Split Ratios on investor interest. The purpose of selecting a range is to give the Board the flexibility to meet\nbusiness needs as they arise, to take advantage of favorable opportunities and to respond to a changing corporate environment. Based on the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as\nof the date of this Proxy Statement, after completion of the Reverse Stock Split, we will have between 724,749 and 7,247,491 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, depending on the Approved Split\nRatio selected by the Board.\nPrincipal Effects of the Reverse Stock Split\nAfter the effective date of the proposed Reverse Stock Split, each stockholder will own a reduced number of shares of common stock. The proposed Reverse Stock Split will affect all stockholders\nuniformly. The proportionate voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of our common stock will not be affected by the proposed Reverse Stock Split. For example, a holder of 2% of the\nvoting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately prior to a Reverse Stock Split would continue to hold 2% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock\nimmediately after such Reverse Stock Split.\nThe following table contains approximate number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and the estimated per share trading price following a 1:2 to 1:20 Reverse Stock Split, without giving\neffect to the issuance of any derivative securities, as of November 22, 2024.\nAfter Each Reverse Stock Split Ratio\nCurrent 1:2 1:20\nCommon stock Authorized 100,000,000 100,000,000 100,000,000\nCommon stock Issued and Outstanding 14,494,983 7,247,491 724,749\nNumber of Shares of common stock Reserved for Issuance(1) 29,361,874 14,680,937 1,468,093\nNumber of Shares of common stock Authorized but Unissued and Unreserved 56,143,143 28,071,571 2,807,157\nPrice per share, based on the closing price of our common stock on the Record Date(2) $ 1.38 $ 2.76 $ 27.60\n(1) Includes shares reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2010 Plan”) and the Company’s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”).\n(2) The price per share indicated reflects solely the application of the applicable reverse split ratio to the closing price of the common stock on the Record Date.\nAfter the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, our common stock would have a new CUSIP number, a number used to identify our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and we are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. The proposed Reverse Stock\nSplit will not affect the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act. Our common stock would continue to be reported on Nasdaq under the symbol “GCTK”, although it is likely that Nasdaq\nwould add the letter “D” to the end of the trading symbol for a period of twenty trading days after the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split to indicate that the Reverse Stock Split had occurred.\n13\nEffect on Outstanding Derivative Securities\nThe Reverse Stock Split will require that proportionate adjustments be made to the conversion rate, the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the\nfollowing outstanding derivative securities issued by us, in accordance with the Approved Split Ratio (all figures are as of November 22, 2024, and are on a pre-Reverse Stock Split basis), including:\n● 179,014 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.45 per share, under our 2010 Plan.\n● 16,442 shares of awarded but unissued restricted stock under our 2010 Plan;\n● 2,621 shares of awarded but unissued restricted stock units under our 2010 Plan;\n● 8,760 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.08 per share, under our 2024 Plan;\n● 54,248 shares of awarded but unissued restricted stock under our 2024 Plan;\n● 0 shares of awarded but unissued restricted stock units under our 2024 Plan;\n● 1,362,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants;\n● 9,834,957 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants (not accounting for Adjustments); and\n● 9,834,957 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants (not accounting for Adjustments).\nThe adjustments to the above securities, as required by the Reverse Stock Split and in accordance with the Approved Split Ratio, would result in approximately the same aggregate price being required to\nbe paid under such securities upon exercise, and approximately the same value of shares of common stock being delivered upon such exercise or conversion, immediately following the Reverse Stock Split as\nwas the case immediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split.\nEffect on Equity Incentive Plans\nAs of November 22, 2024, we had 65,629 shares and 2,675,636 shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options issued under our 2010 Plan and 2024 Plan,\nrespectively. Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Plan and the 2024 Plan, the Board, or a designated committee thereof, as applicable, will adjust the number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding\nawards, the exercise price per share of outstanding stock options and other terms of outstanding awards issued pursuant to the 2010 Plan and the 2024 Plan to equitably reflect the effects of the Reverse\nStock Split. The number of shares subject to vesting under restricted stock awards and the number of shares issuable as contingent consideration as part of an acquisition by the Company will be similarly\nadjusted, subject to our treatment of fractional shares. Furthermore, the number of shares available for future grant under the 2024 Plan will be similarly adjusted.\nEffective Date\nThe proposed Reverse Stock Split would become effective on the date of filing of the Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware unless another\neffective date is set forth in the Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment. On the effective date, shares of common stock issued and outstanding shares of common stock held in treasury, in each case,\nimmediately prior thereto will be combined and reclassified, automatically and without any action on the part of our stockholders, into new shares of common stock in accordance with the Approved Split\nRatio set forth in this Proposal 2. If the proposed Reverse Stock Split Charter Amendment is not adopted and approved by our stockholders, the Reverse Stock Split will not occur.\nTreatment of Fractional Shares\nNo fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of\nshares not evenly divisible by the reverse stock split ratio will automatically be entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole share.\n14\nRecord and Beneficial Stockholders\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is authorized by our stockholders and our Board elects to implement the Reverse Stock Split, stockholders of record holding some or all of their shares of common stock\nelectronically in book entry form under the direct registration system for securities will receive a transaction statement at their address of record indicating the number of shares of common stock they hold\nafter the Reverse Stock Split. Non-registered stockholders holding common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee should note that such banks, brokers or other nominees may have different\nprocedures for processing the consolidation than those that would be put in place by us for registered stockholders. If you hold your shares with such a bank, broker or other nominee and if you have\nquestions in this regard, you are encouraged to contact your nominee.\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is authorized by the stockholders and our Board elects to implement the Reverse Stock Split, stockholders of record holding some or all of their shares in certificate form will\nreceive a letter of transmittal, as soon as practicable after the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split. Our transfer agent will act as “exchange agent” for the purpose of implementing the exchange of stock\ncertificates. Holders of pre-Reverse Stock Split shares will be asked to surrender to the exchange agent certificates representing pre-Reverse Stock Split shares in exchange for post-Reverse Stock Split shares\nand payment in lieu of fractional shares (if any) in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in the letter of transmittal. Until surrender, each certificate representing shares before the Reverse Stock Split\nwould continue to be valid and would represent the adjusted number of whole shares based on the approved exchange ratio of the Reverse Stock Split selected by the Board. No new post-Reverse Stock Split\nshare certificates will be issued to a stockholder until such stockholder has surrendered such stockholder’s outstanding certificate(s) together with the properly completed and executed letter of transmittal to\nthe exchange agent.\nSTOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY PRE-REVERSE STOCK SPLIT STOCK CERTIFICATE AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY ARE REQUESTED TO DO\nSO.\nAccounting Consequences\nThe par value per share of common stock would remain unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Reverse Stock Split. As a result, on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, the stated capital on our\nbalance sheet attributable to the common stock will be reduced proportionally, based on the Approved Split Ratio selected by the Board, from its present amount, and the additional paid-in capital account\nshall be credited with the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. The per share common stock net income or loss and net book value will be increased because there will be fewer shares of common\nstock outstanding. The shares of common stock held in treasury, if any, will also be reduced proportionately based on the Approved Split Ratio selected by the Board. Retroactive restatement will be given to\nall share numbers in the financial statements, and accordingly all amounts including per share amounts will be shown on a post-split basis. We do not anticipate that any other accounting consequences\nwould arise as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\nNo Appraisal Rights\nOur stockholders are not entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to this Proposal 2 and we will not independently provide our stockholders with any such right if the\nReverse Stock Split is implemented.\nMaterial Federal U.S. Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split\nThe following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of a Reverse Stock Split to our stockholders. The summary is based on the Code, applicable U.S. Department of the\nTreasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority and current administrative rulings and practices as in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. Changes to the laws could alter the tax\nconsequences described below, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought and will not seek an opinion of counsel or a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the federal\nincome tax consequences of a Reverse Stock Split. This discussion only addresses stockholders who hold common stock as capital assets. It does not purport to be complete and does not address\nstockholders subject to special tax treatment under the Code, including, without limitation, financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, foreign stockholders,\nstockholders who hold their pre-Reverse Stock Split shares as part of a straddle, hedge or conversion transaction, and stockholders who acquired their pre-Reverse Stock Split shares pursuant to the exercise\nof employee stock options or otherwise as compensation. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our common stock, the U.S.\nfederal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships (and other entities treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purpose) holding our common stock and the partners in such entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nproposed Reverse Stock Split to them. In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split under state, local and foreign tax laws. Furthermore, the\nfollowing discussion does not address any tax consequences of transactions effectuated before, after or at the same time as the Reverse Stock Split, whether or not they are in connection with the Reverse\nStock Split.\n15\nWe believe that because the Reverse Stock Split is not part of a plan to increase periodically a stockholder’s proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits, the Reverse Stock Split should\nhave the following federal income tax effects. The Reverse Stock Split is expected to constitute a “recapitalization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code. A\nstockholder who receives solely a reduced number of shares of common stock will not recognize gain or loss. In the aggregate, such a stockholder’s basis in the reduced number of shares of common stock\nwill equal the stockholder’s basis in its old shares of common stock and such stockholder’s holding period in the reduced number of shares will include the holding period in its old shares exchanged. The\nTreasury Regulations provide detailed rules for allocating the tax basis and holding period of shares of common stock surrendered in a recapitalization to shares received in the recapitalization. Stockholders\nof our common stock acquired on different dates and at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis and holding period of such shares.\nWe will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the proposed Reverse Stock Split.\nA stockholder of our common stock will be subject to backup withholding if such stockholder is not otherwise exempt and such stockholder does not provide its taxpayer identification number in the\nmanner required or otherwise fails to comply with backup withholding tax rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or\nallowed as a credit against a stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Stockholders of our common stock should consult their own\ntax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nTHE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL U.S. INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE\nA COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL,\nSTATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT IN LIGHT OF YOUR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.\nVotes Required\nPursuant to changes to Section 242 of the DGCL, which became effective on August 1, 2023 (the “DGCL Change”), the necessary stockholder vote to approve reverse stock splits and an increase in\nauthorized share capital was reduced from a majority of outstanding shares entitled to vote, to a majority of votes actually cast at a meeting. In addition to reducing the required shareholder vote for approval\nof these actions, the DGCL Change has the effect of causing abstentions to have no effect on a stockholder vote. This reduced vote requirement only applies to companies (like ours) whose stock is listed on\na national securities exchange and who would continue to meet the listing requirements of the exchange immediately after giving effect to such actions.\nPursuant to the DCGL Change, approval and adoption of this Proposal 2 requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of votes actually cast at the meeting. Proposal 2 is generally considered to be a\n“routine” matter which means that banks, brokers or other nominees will have discretionary authority to vote on this matter. Accordingly, no “broker non-votes” are expected on Proposal 2. Abstentions and\n“broker non-votes”, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 2.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.\n16\nPROPOSAL 3\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY’S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE OUR AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM 100,000,000 TO\n250,000,000\nOverview\nOur Board has approved, subject to shareholder approval, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 250,000,000 (the\n“Charter Amendment”). The increase in our authorized shares of common stock will become effective upon the filing of the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. If the\nCharter Amendment to increase our authorized shares of common stock is approved by the stockholders at the Special Meeting, we intend to file the Charter Amendment as soon as practicable following the\nSpecial Meeting. The Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval of the Charter Amendment and without further action by our stockholders, not to proceed with the Charter Amendment\nat any time before it becomes effective.\nThe form of Charter Amendment is set forth as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement (subject to any changes required by applicable law, or any changes that might be required in connection with the\napproval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal).\nOutstanding Shares and Purpose of the Proposal\nOur Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes us to issue a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value\nper share. As of the Record Date, we had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding and the Charter Amendment does not affect the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. Our issued and\noutstanding securities, as of the record date, are as follows:\n● 5,772,026 shares of our common stock;\n● 1,362,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of Pre-Funded Warrants;\n● 25,126,161 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants (including the Common Warrants, assuming Stockholder Approval, but not accounting for any\nAdjustments); and\n● 190,353 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options.\nThe approval of the Charter Amendment to increase our authorized shares of common stock is important for our ongoing business. Our Board believes it would be prudent and advisable to have the\nadditional shares available to provide additional flexibility regarding the potential use of shares of common stock for business and financial purposes in the future. Having an increased number of authorized\nbut unissued shares of common stock would allow us to take prompt action with respect to corporate opportunities that develop, without the delay and expense of convening a special meeting of\nstockholders for the purpose of approving an increase in our authorized shares. The additional shares could be used for various purposes without further stockholder approval. These purposes may include:\n(i) raising capital, if we have an appropriate opportunity, through offerings of common stock or securities that are convertible into common stock; (ii) expanding our business through potential strategic\ntransactions, including mergers, acquisitions, licensing transactions and other business combinations or acquisitions of new product candidates or products; (iii) establishing strategic relationships with\nother companies; (iv) exchanges of common stock or securities that are convertible into common stock for other outstanding securities; (v) providing equity incentives pursuant to our 2024 Plan, or another\nplan we may adopt in the future, to attract and retain employees, officers or directors; and (vi) other general corporate purposes. We intend to use the additional shares of common stock that will be available\nto undertake any such issuances described above. Because it is anticipated that our directors and executive officers will be granted additional equity awards under our 2024 Plan, or another plan we adopt in\nthe future, they may be deemed to have an indirect interest in the Charter Amendment. Further, as discussed above, if the Issuance Proposal is approved, the outstanding Common Warrants are exercisable\nfor an aggregate of a maximum of 254,303,888 shares of common stock.\n17\nThe increase in authorized shares of our common stock under the Charter Amendment will not have any immediate effect on the rights of existing stockholders. However, because the holders of our\ncommon stock do not have any preemptive rights, future issuance of shares of common stock or securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our\nearnings per share, book value per share, voting rights of stockholders and could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nDisadvantages to an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock may include:\n● Stockholders may experience further dilution of their ownership;\n● Stockholders will not have any preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock that may be issued in the future, and therefore, future issuances of\ncommon stock, depending on the circumstances, will have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share, voting power and other interests of our existing stockholders;\n● The additional shares of common stock for which authorization is sought in this proposal would be part of the existing class of common stock and, if and when issued, would have the same rights\nand privileges as the shares of common stock presently outstanding; and\n● The issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock could be used to deter a potential takeover of us that may otherwise be beneficial to stockholders by diluting the shares held by a\npotential suitor or issuing shares to a stockholder that will vote in accordance with the Board’s desires. A takeover may be beneficial to independent stockholders because, among other reasons, a\npotential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of stock compared to the then-existing market price. We do not have any plans or proposals to adopt provisions or enter into\nagreements that may have material anti-takeover consequences.\nExcept as disclosed in this proxy statement, we have no specific plan, commitment, arrangement, understanding or agreement, either oral or written, regarding the issuance of the proposed new\nauthorization of common stock subsequent to this proposed increase in the number of authorized shares at this time, and we have not allocated any specific portion of the proposed increase in the authorized\nnumber of shares to any particular purpose. However, we have in the past conducted certain public and private offerings of common stock and warrants, and we will continue to require additional capital in\nthe near future to fund our operations. As a result, it is foreseeable that we will seek to issue such additional shares of common stock in connection with any such capital raising activities, or any of the other\nactivities described above. The Board does not intend to issue any common stock or securities convertible into common stock except on terms that the Board deems to be in the best interests of us and our\nstockholders.\nRequired Vote of Stockholders\nPursuant to the DCGL Change, approval and adoption of this Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of votes actually cast at the meeting. Proposal 3 is generally considered to be a\n“routine” matter which means that banks, brokers or other nominees will have discretionary authority to vote on this matter. Accordingly, no “broker non-votes” are expected on Proposal 3. Abstentions and\n“broker non-votes”, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 3.\nRecommendation of our Board of Directors\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” APPROVAL OF THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\n18\nPROPOSAL 4\nADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL\nHolders of Company common stock are being asked to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Board of Directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the Board of Directors to\nadjourn the Special Meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the stockholders approve this proposal, the Board of Directors could adjourn the Special Meeting and\nany adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders who have previously voted.\nThis Adjournment Proposal will be presented to stockholders at the Special Meeting to seek their approval of an adjournment to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional\nproxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Issuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, or the Charter Amendment Proposal or to constitute a quorum.\nIf, at the Special Meeting, the number of shares present or represented and voting to approve the presented Proposals is not sufficient to approve the Issuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split\nProposal, the Charter Amendment Proposal or if a quorum is not present, the Board of Directors currently intends to move to adjourn the Special Meeting to enable the Board of Directors to solicit additional\nproxies for the approval of the Issuance Proposal, the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, and the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nRequired Vote of Stockholders\nThe approval of Proposal 4 requires that holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon vote “FOR” Proposal 4. Abstentions are\nconsidered votes present and entitled to vote on this proposal, and thus, will have the same effect as a vote “against” the proposal. Because Proposal 4 is considered a “routine” matter under applicable\nstock exchange rules, we do not expect to receive any broker non-votes on this proposal.\nRecommendation of our Board of Directors\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.\nHOUSEHOLDING MATTERS\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies to deliver a single copy of proxy materials to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless a company has received contrary instructions from one or\nmore of the stockholders at that address. This means that only one copy of the proxy materials may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. If you would prefer to receive separate copies\nof the proxy materials either now or in the future, please contact our Corporate Secretary either by calling (201) 842-7715 or by mailing a request to Attn: Corporate Secretary, 301 Rte. 17 North, Ste. 800,\nRutherford, NJ 07070. Upon written or oral request to the Corporate Secretary, the Company will provide a separate copy of the proxy materials. In addition, stockholders at a shared address who receive\nmultiple copies of proxy materials may request to receive a single copy of proxy materials in the future in the same manner as described above.\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nOnly proper proposals under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act which are timely received will be included in the proxy materials for our next annual meeting. In order to be considered timely, such proposal\nmust be received by our Chief Financial Officer at the address provided herein for our corporate offices in New Jersey no later than December 3, 2024. We suggest that stockholders submit any stockholder\nproposal by certified mail, return receipt requested.\nOur Bylaws require stockholders to provide advance notice to the Company of any stockholder director nomination(s) and any other matter a stockholder wishes to present for action at an annual\nmeeting of stockholders (other than matters to be included in our proxy statement, which are discussed in the previous paragraph). In order to properly bring business before an annual meeting, our Bylaws\nrequire, among other things, that the stockholder submit written notice thereof complying with our Bylaws to our Chief Financial Officer, at the above address, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days\nprior to the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. Therefore, the Company must receive notice of a stockholder proposal submitted other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (as discussed above) no\nsooner than December 27, 2024, and no later than January 26, 2025. If a stockholder fails to provide timely notice of a proposal to be presented at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proxy\ndesignated by our Board will have discretionary authority to vote on any such proposal that may come before the meeting.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of\nGlucotrack, Inc.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Paul Goode\nPaul Goode\nChief Executive Officer\nRutherford, New Jersey\n, 2024\n19\nAppendix A\nCERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT\nOF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\nOF GLUCOTRACK, INC.\nGlucotrack, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Corporation”), does hereby certify as follows:\n1.

(the “Company”) has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to all officers and employees that urges\nthem promptly to discuss with or disclose to their supervisor, the Company’s Ethics Officer or the Board of\nDirectors any events of questionable, fraudulent, unethical or illegal nature. As an additional measure to support our\ncommitment to ethical conduct, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has adopted the following policies\nand procedures for (i) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding\naccounting, internal controls, financial reporting or auditing matters; and (ii) the confidential, anonymous\nsubmission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting, financial reporting or\nauditing matters.\nThis policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section\n922 of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.\nReporting of Concerns or Complaints Regarding Accounting, Internal Controls, Financial Reporting or\nAuditing Matters\nTaking action to prevent problems is part of the Company’s culture. If you observe possible unethical or illegal\nconduct, you are encouraged to report your concerns. Employees and others involved with the Company are urged to\ncome forward with any such information, without regard to the identity or position of the suspected offender.\nTo facilitate the investigation of a complaint, to the extent practicable, the complaint should include a full statement\nof the acts or omissions, along with relevant dates, forming the basis of the complaint. In addition, the\ncomplaint should state that it is being made pursuant to this policy.\nEmployees and others may choose any of the following modes of communicating suspected violations of law,\npolicy, or other wrongdoing, as well as any concerns regarding questionable accounting, financial reporting or\nauditing matters (including deficiencies in internal controls), or concerns about retaliation against employees or\ncontractors who, in good faith, make reports regarding any of the foregoing:\n● Report the matter to your supervisor; or\n● Report the matter by mailing the Chairman of the Audit Committee, c/o the Company’s Ethics Officer at the\nCompany’s corporate headquarters (such communication may be anonymous if desired); or\n● Report the matter to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Ethics Officer.\nConfidentiality\nThe Company will treat all communications under this Policy in a confidential manner, except to the extent necessary\n(a) to conduct a complete and fair investigation, or (b) for reviews of Company operations by the Company’s Board\nof Directors, its Audit Committee, the Company’s independent public accountants or the Company’s outside legal\ncounsel.\nWe encourage employees and other reporting persons to put their names on the complaint in order to enable the\nCompany to contact you with follow up questions. The investigation may require more detailed information from the\nsource of the information in order to quickly and efficiently ascertain the details of the reported incident. However, if\nyou choose, you may always submit an anonymous report.\nInvestigation\nThe Audit Committee, with the input of the Chief Executive Officer, outside counsel and/or the Chief Financial\nOfficer, other Company management and/or outside consultants, if requested by the Audit Committee and so long as\nsuch persons are not the subject of the complaint, will determine the scope of investigation to be conducted, the validity\nof the complaint and any corrective action, as appropriate. All employees have a duty to promptly cooperate and\nprovide accurate information in connection with any investigation of reports of questionable conduct, or of retaliation\nresulting from the reporting or investigation of such matters.\nIf a complaint is reported directly to the Audit Committee, it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to report to\nCompany management any noncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to assure that management\ntakes corrective action including, where appropriate, reporting any violation to the relevant federal, state or regulatory\nauthorities.\nThe Audit Committee also has the authority to retain additional outside legal or accounting expertise in any\ninvestigation as it deems necessary to conduct the investigation in accordance with its charter and this policy.\nRetaliation\nAny individual who in good faith reports a possible violation of the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics, or of\nlaw, rule or regulation, or any concerns regarding questionable accounting, financial reporting or auditing matters,\neven if the report is mistaken, or who assists in the investigation of a reported violation, will be protected by the\nCompany. Retaliation in any form against these individuals will not be tolerated. Any act of retaliation should be\nreported immediately and will be disciplined appropriately.\nSpecifically, the Company will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate\nor retaliate against any employee in the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment because of any lawful\nact done by that employee to either (a) provide information, cause information to be provided, or otherwise assist in\nany investigation regarding any conduct that the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of any Company\ncode of conduct or policy, law, rule, or regulation, including any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, or (b) file, cause to be filed, testify, participate in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding filed or, to the\nemployee’s knowledge, about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of any such law, rule, or regulation.\nWe assume that our employees and others will act in good faith and will not make false accusations when reporting\nwrongdoing. An employee who knowingly or recklessly makes statements or disclosures that are not in good faith\nwill not be protected by this policy and may be subject to discipline, which may include termination. Additionally,\nemployees who report acts of wrongdoing pursuant to this policy will continue to be held to the Company’s general\njob performance standards and adherence to the Company’s policies and procedures.\nRecords Retention\nThe Company will maintain records of complaint reports and related records consistent with the Company’s document\nretention policy in effect from time to time and in compliance with applicable law but in no event for a period of less\nthan seven (7) years from the date the complaint report is received or the related record is created, as applicable. It is\nillegal and against the Company’s policy to destroy any records that may be subject to or related to an investigation\nby the Company or any federal, state or regulatory body.\nReporting to Governmental Agencies\nThis policy is intended to encourage and enable employees to raise good faith concerns about questionable, fraudulent,\nunethical or illegal conduct to designated Company personnel prior to providing any notification outside the Company.\nHowever, nothing in this policy is intended to prevent an employee or others from reporting information to the\nappropriate governmental agency when the employee has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law has\noccurred, whether or not the reporting person has previously submitted a complaint under this policy.\nGovernmental agencies may pay bounties to persons who report information with respect to violations of law. To\nfurther encourage and enable employees to first report information to the designated Company personnel under this\npolicy, the Company will take appropriate steps to assist any person submitting a complaint under this policy to receive\nany applicable bounty, including providing the relevant agency with the identity and timing of the submission of the\ncomplaint by such person in order to assist such person in claiming such bounty."
