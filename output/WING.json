(NASDAQ: WING) today announced that its board of directors approved the purchase of up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding shares of common stock under its existing share repurchase program, effective immediately. This repurchase program follows the substantial completion of purchases of common stock under the inaugural $250 million repurchase authorization from August 2023. With this additional repurchase authorization, the Company anticipates executing a $250 million accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program that will commence in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n[ ![Wingstop Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Wingstop Restaurants Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1199181/Wingstop_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1199181/Wingstop_Logo.html)\n\n“We believe our asset-lite, highly-franchised model enables industry-leading shareholder returns,” commented Alex Kaleida, Chief Financial Officer. “Since becoming a public company in 2015, we have returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders. Our share repurchase program is another example of the long-term value creation enabled by our category of one operating model.”\n\nRepurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and accelerated share repurchase agreements, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at Wingstop’s discretion, depending on market and business conditions, prevailing stock prices, and contractual limitations, among other factors. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. This program does not obligate Wingstop to acquire any particular amount of common stock, or at any specific time or intervals and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at Wingstop’s discretion.\n\nWingstop expects to fund repurchases with existing cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from its recently completed $500 million financing transaction which closed on December 3, 2024.\n\n**About Wingstop**\n\nFounded in 1994 and headquartered in Dallas, TX, Wingstop Inc.

Reports Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n  * October 30, 2024\n\n\n\n![Submit](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pdf.svg) Download\n\n**Delivers Record Third Quarter with 106** **Net New Openings and 17.1% Unit Growth**\n\n**Domestic Same Store Sales Increased 20.9%, Driven by Transaction Growth**\n\nDALLAS, Oct. 30, 2024 — Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ: WING) today announced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\n[ ![Wingstop Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Wingstop Restaurants Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1199181/Wingstop_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1199181/Wingstop_Logo.html)\n\n**Highlights for the fiscal third quarter 2024 compared to the fiscal third quarter 2023:**\n\n  * System-wide sales increased 39.4% to $1.2 billion\n  * 106 net new openings in the fiscal third quarter 2024\n  * Domestic restaurant AUV increased to $2.1 million\n  * Domestic same store sales increased 20.9%\n  * Digital sales increased to 69.0% of system-wide sales\n  * Total revenue increased 38.8% to $162.5 million\n  * Net income increased 31.9% to $25.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 39.5% to $53.7 million\n\n\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) is set forth in the schedule accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_\n\n“Our third quarter results demonstrated the staying power of our multi-year strategies we are executing against, delivering 20.9% same store sales growth, primarily driven by transaction growth,” said Michael Skipworth, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We opened a record 106 net new units in the third quarter, a 17.1% growth in system-wide restaurants over the prior year, which showcases the excitement among our Brand Partners who are seeing industry-leading returns.”\n\n**Key operating metrics for the fiscal third quarter 2024 compared to the fiscal third quarter 2023:**\n\n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**September 28, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nNumber of system-wide restaurants open at end of period |  2,458 |  2,099  \nNumber of domestic franchise restaurants open at end of period |  2,064 |  1,791  \nNumber of international franchise restaurants open at end of period (1) |  338 |  262  \nSystem-wide sales (in millions) |  $ 1,233 |  $ 885  \nDomestic AUV (in thousands) |  $ 2,116 |  $ 1,755  \nDomestic same store sales growth |  20.9 % |  15.3 %  \nCompany-owned domestic same store sales growth |  7.3 % |  6.0 %  \nNet income (in thousands) |  $ 25,732 |  $ 19,511  \nAdjusted EBITDA (in thousands)  |  $ 53,672 |  $ 38,483  \n  \n_______________________  \n---  \n(1) Including U.S. territories.  \n  \n**Fiscal third quarter 2024 financial results**\n\nTotal revenue for the fiscal third quarter 2024 increased to $162.5 million from $117.1 million in the fiscal third quarter last year. Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other increased $21.2 million, of which $9.6 million was due to domestic same store sales growth of 20.9%, and $9.3 million was due to net new franchise development. Advertising fees increased $16.8 million due to a 39.4% increase in system-wide sales in the fiscal third quarter 2024, as well as an increase in the national advertising fund contribution rate to 5.3% from 5.0%, effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024. Company-owned restaurant sales increased $7.4 million due to the addition of 10 net new company-owned restaurants since the prior fiscal third quarter and 7.3% company-owned domestic same store sales growth, driven primarily by an increase in transactions.\n\nCost of sales was $24.4 million compared to $17.6 million in the fiscal third quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales, cost of sales increased to 77.8% from 73.6% in the prior year comparable period. The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales was driven by food, beverage and packaging costs primarily resulting from an increase in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior fiscal third quarter. Our purchases in the prior fiscal third quarter were tied primarily to the spot market, which benefited from significant deflation in the cost of bone-in chicken wings.\n\nSelling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased $9.2 million to $32.3 million from $23.0 million in the fiscal third quarter of the prior year. The increase in SG&A expense was driven by an increase in performance-based stock compensation and incentive compensation expense of $4.9 million primarily related to the Company’s performance, an increase in headcount related expenses of $2.8 million to support the growth in our business, an increase in consulting and other professional fees of $1.3 million associated with our strategic initiatives, including system implementation costs.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million to $5.1 million from $3.4 million in the fiscal third quarter of the prior year. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation expense for the software assets placed in service during the second fiscal quarter 2024 related to our MyWingstop technology platform.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe Company is reiterating guidance of approximately 20% domestic same store sales growth for fiscal year 2024.\n\nAdditionally, based on year-to-date results, the Company is providing updated guidance for 2024:\n\n  * 320 to 330 global net new units, previously 285 to 300;\n  * Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22.5 million, previously $20 million;\n  * SG&A expense of between $117.5 – $118.5 million, previously $114 – 116 million; and\n  * Depreciation and amortization of approximately $19 million, previously $18 – $19 million.\n\n\n\n**Restaurant Development**\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, there were 2,458 Wingstop restaurants system-wide. This included 2,120 restaurants in the United States, of which 2,064 were franchised restaurants and 56 were company-owned, and 338 franchised restaurants were in international markets and U.S. territories. During the fiscal third quarter 2024, there were 106 net system-wide Wingstop restaurant openings.\n\n**Quarterly Dividend**\n\nIn recognition of the Company’s strong cash flow generation and our commitment to returning value to stockholders, on October 29, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share of common stock, resulting in a total dividend of approximately $7.9 million. This dividend will be paid on December 6, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 93,617 shares of its common stock at an average price of $373.68 per share. As of September 28, 2024, $61.1 million remained available under the share repurchase program previously approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company has repurchased and retired 815,431 shares of its common stock at an average price of $276.43 per share since inception of its share repurchase program in August 2023.\n\n**The following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:**\n\n**Domestic average unit volume (“AUV”)** consists of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all restaurants being measured by the number of restaurants being measured. Domestic AUV includes revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants. Domestic AUV allows management to assess our domestic company-owned and franchised restaurant economics. Changes in domestic AUV are primarily driven by increases in same store sales and are also influenced by opening new restaurants.\n\n**Domestic same store sales** reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the same store restaurant base. We define the same store restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and permanent closures. We review same store sales for domestic company-owned restaurants as well as system-wide domestic restaurants. Domestic same store sales growth is driven by increases in transactions and average transaction size. Transaction size increases are driven by price increases or favorable mix shift from either an increase in items purchased or shifts into higher priced items.\n\n**System-wide sales** represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants, as reported by franchisees. This measure allows management to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall store performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by new restaurant openings as well as increases in same store sales.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is defined as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), further adjusted for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, system implementation costs, and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions above may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate certain non-GAAP measurements in the same manner.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today to discuss the fiscal third quarter 2024 financial results at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. The conference call can be joined telephonically by dialing 1-877-259-5243 or 1-412-317-5176 (international) and asking for the Wingstop conference call.

The Company landed on Entrepreneur Magazine’s “Fastest-Growing Franchises” list and ranked #16 on “Franchise 500.” Wingstop was listed on Technomic’s “Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report,” QSR Magazine’s “2023 QSR 50” and Franchise Time’s “40 Smartest-Growing Franchises.” \n\nFor more information, visit [www.wingstop.com](http://www.wingstop.com) or [www.wingstop.com/own-a-wingstop](http://www.wingstop.com/own-a-wingstop) and follow @Wingstop on X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

By providing non-GAAP financial measures, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. These measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures used in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in this news release. In addition, the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) concurrent with the issuance of this press release includes a more detailed description of each of these non-GAAP financial measures, together with a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of such measures.\n\n**Forward-looking Statements**\n\nThis news release includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability, trends, liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “think,” “estimate,” “seek,” “predict,” “can,” “could,” “project,” “potential” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such terms. Examples of forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, our 2024 fiscal year outlook for domestic same store sales growth, global net new units, SG&A expense, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties, risks, and factors relating to our operations and business environments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which can be found at the SEC’s website [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). The discussion of these risks is specifically incorporated by reference into this news release.\n\nWhen considering forward-looking statements in this news release or that we make in other reports or statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this news release and future reports we file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. Any forward-looking statement in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it was made. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\n**Media Contact** Maddie LuporiMedia@wingstop.com\n\n**Investor Contact** Kristen ThomasIR@wingstop.com\n\n**WINGSTOP INC.
