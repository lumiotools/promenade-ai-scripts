(NASDAQ: NSTS) (the “Company” or “NSTS Bancorp”), the stock holding company of North Shore Trust and Savings, announced today the execution of a balance sheet repositioning strategy related to its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\n\nIn December 2023, the Bank sold $30.5 million in book value of lower yielding available-for-sale investment securities, generating an after-tax loss of approximately $1.8 million. The securities sold are comprised primarily of U.S. Treasury notes, agency, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations with an average yield of 2.83% and an average duration of 2.75 years and represented approximately 25.0% of the Bank’s securities portfolio.\n\nThe sale of these securities is designed to seek to improve the Bank’s earnings going forward, beginning in fiscal year 2024, and to provide liquidity to deleverage its balance sheet. Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay approximately $10.0 million in existing debt with a current rate of 5.31%, with the remainder to be re-deployed into cash and short-term U.S. Treasury notes with an average expected yield in excess of 5.0% and to fund additional residential loan growth and general working capital at the Bank.\n\nAfter the repositioning, both the Bank and the Company remain well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital standards, and the Company continues to maintain a tangible common equity ratio in excess of 10.0% and strong liquidity, including an unused $64.3 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank Chicago. The loss on the sale of securities is expected to have a neutral impact on the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity and tangible book value per share.\n\nThe Company is also announcing today that it expects to recognize an additional valuation allowance of approximately $1.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 on the remaining portion of its deferred tax asset as the Company believes these are more likely than not to not be realized. During 2023, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing portion of the deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth.\n\nAbout NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and North Shore Trust and Savings\n\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc. is the stock holding company of North Shore Trust and Savings. As of September 30, 2023, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. had approximately $252 million in assets and operates from its headquarters and main banking office in Waukegan, Illinois, as well as two additional full-service branch offices located in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and conform to practices within the banking industry. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual financial statements. The interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary, in the opinion of management, for fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. Results for the _three_ and _nine_ month periods ended _September 30, 2024_ , are _not_ necessarily indicative of the results that _may_ be expected for the year ending _December_ _31,_ _2024._\n\n**Nature of Operations**\n\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc. (“NSTS” or the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was formed to serve as the stock holding company for North Shore Trust and Savings (the “Bank”) in connection with the conversion of North Shore Trust and Savings, NSTS Financial Corporation and North Shore MHC, into the stock form of organization, which was completed on _January 18, 2022._ Shares of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. stock began trading on _January 19, 2022_ on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol \"NSTS.\"\n\nThe Bank operates primarily out of _three_ bank branch locations in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. In efforts to expand our loan originations within the Chicagoland area, the Bank also has _three_ loan production offices, located in Chicago, Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois. The lending team operates as Oak Leaf Community Mortgage, powered by North Shore Trust and Savings. The Bank offers a variety of financial services to customers in our surrounding community. Financial services consist primarily of _1_ -_4_ family mortgage loans, savings accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. There are _no_ significant concentrations of loans to any _one_ industry or customer. The Bank’s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the Bank’s market area.\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and the instructions to Form _10_ -Q and Rule _10_ -_01_ of Regulation S-_X._ Accordingly, they do _not_ include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with NSTS Bancorp, Inc.’s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form _10_ -K for the year ended _December 31, 2023_. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nManagement is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results _may_ vary from those estimates. Material estimates that could significantly change in the near-term include the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, determination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the valuation of investment securities and the related tax effect. The results of operations for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ , are _not_ necessarily indicative of results that _may_ be expected for any other interim period or the entire fiscal year ending _December 31, 2024._ Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of issuance of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. _No_ significant subsequent events have occurred through this date requiring adjustment to the financial statements or disclosures.\n\nIn _March 2024,_ the FASB issued ASU _No._ _2024_ -_01,_ “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic _718_): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards” (ASU _2024_ -_01_). ASU _2024_ -_01_ adds an example to Topic _718_ which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic _718_ or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU _2024_ -_01_ is effective for annual periods beginning after _December 15, 2025,_ although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU _2024_ -_01_ is _not_ expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\n\n_8_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Note _2:_ Securities Available for Sale**\n\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , by contractual maturity, are shown below.

There were _no_ securities with identified credit losses at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively. Unrealized losses have _not_ been recognized into income because, based on management's evaluation, the decline in fair value is largely due to increased market rates, temporary market conditions and trading spreads, and, as such, are considered to be temporary by the Bank. In addition, management has the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or they recover their carrying values. \n\nAll U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-based residential obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are agency-issued or government-sponsored enterprise issued. Agency-issued securities are generally guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Small Business Administration, have either a direct or implied guarantee by the U.S. government. \n\nThe Bank holds _two_ classifications of municipal bonds, general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are backed by the general revenue of the issuing municipality, while revenue bonds are supported by a specific revenue source. All general obligation and revenue bonds have a bond rating of investment grade by Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investor Services or are _not_ rated. There have been _no_ declines in investment grades on bonds in a loss position and as of  _September 30, 2024_ , all municipal bonds are paying as agreed. \n\nThere were no sales of securities available-for-sale during the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_. \n\n**Note _3:_ Loans and allowance for credit losses**\n\nA summary of loans by major category as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ is as follows:\n\n**_September 30, 2024_** |  **_December 31, 2023_**  \n---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nFirst mortgage loans  \n1-4 family residential | $| 125,052| $| 111,081  \nMulti-family | 3,539| 3,111  \nCommercial | 4,152| 3,835  \nConstruction | 1,380| 2,508  \nTotal first mortgage loans | 134,123| 120,535  \nConsumer loans | 275| 248  \nTotal loans | 134,398| 120,783  \nNet deferred loan costs | 684| 1,016  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans | (1,271| )| (1,176| )  \nTotal loans, net | $| 133,811| $| 120,623  \n  \nFirst mortgage loans serviced for others are _not_ included in the accompanying balance sheets.

Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the loans serviced were $116,000 and $231,000 at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively.\n\nThe accrued interest receivable for loans, net, was $566,000 and $392,000 for _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023,_ respectively\n\nIn the normal course of business, loans are made by the Bank to directors and officers of the Company and the Bank (related parties). The terms of these loans, including interest rate and collateral, are similar to those prevailing for comparable transactions with other customers and do _not_ involve more than a normal risk of collectability. At  _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , such borrowers were indebted to the Bank in the aggregate amount of $535,000 and $550,000, respectively.\n\n_10_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ :\n\n**______September 30, 2024______**  \n---  \n**_1-4 family_**  \n**_residential_** |  **_Multi-family_** |  **_Commercial_** |  **_Construction_** |  **_Consumer_** |  **_Total_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Three months ended**  \nBeginning balance | $| 1,165| $| 36| $| 41| $| 24| $| 1| $| 1,267  \nCharge-offs | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nRecoveries | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nNet recoveries (charge-offs) | —| —| —| —| —| —  \n(Release of) Provision for credit losses | (1| )| 3| 1| —| 1|  4  \nEnding balance | $| 1,164| $| 39| $| 42| $| 24| $| 2| $| 1,271  \n**______September 30, 2024______**  \n---  \n**_1-4 family_**  \n**_residential_** |  **_Multi-family_** |  **_Commercial_** |  **_Construction_** |  **_Consumer_** |  **_Total_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Nine months ended**  \nBeginning balance | $| 1,094| $| 40| $| 37| $| 4| $| 1| $| 1,176  \nCharge-offs | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nRecoveries | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nNet recoveries (charge-offs) | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nProvision for (release of ) credit losses | 70| (1| )| 5| 20| 1| 95  \nEnding balance | $| 1,164| $| 39| $| 42| $| 24| $| 2| $| 1,271  \n**______September 30, 2023______**  \n---  \n**_1-4 family_**  \n**_residential_** |  **_Multi-family_** |  **_Commercial_** |  **_Construction_** |  **_Consumer_** |  **_Total_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Three months ended**  \nBeginning balance | $| 928| $| 41| $| 39| $| —| $| 2| $| 1,010  \nCharge-offs | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nRecoveries | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nNet recoveries (charge-offs) | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nProvision for (release of ) credit losses | 56| (2| )| (3| )| —| —| 51  \nEnding balance | $| 984| $| 39| $| 36| $| —| $| 2| $| 1,061  \n**______September 30, 2023______**  \n---  \n**_1-4 family_**  \n**_residential_** |  **_Multi-family_** |  **_Commercial_** |  **_Construction_** |  **_Consumer_** |  **_Total_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Nine months ended**  \nBeginning balance | $| 581| $| 19| $| 19| $| —| $| 5| $| 624  \nCumulative effect of change in accounting principle | 335| 23| 29| —| (3| )| 384  \nCharge-offs | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nRecoveries | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nNet recoveries (charge-offs) | —| —| —| —| —| —  \nProvision for (release of ) credit losses | 68| (3| )| (12| )| —| —| 53  \nEnding balance | $| 984| $| 39| $| 36| $| —| $| 2| $| 1,061  \n  \nThe ACL on loans excludes $60,000 and $4,000 of allowance for off-balance sheet exposures as of _September 30, 2024_ and _2023,_ respectively, recorded within Other Liabilities.

These loans are collateralized by residential real estate and have no ACL as of _December 31, 2023._ There were _no_ other collateral dependent loans as of _December 31, 2023._\n\nThe Bank evaluates collectability based on payment activity and other factors. The Bank uses a graded loan rating system as a means of identifying potential problem loans, as follows:\n\nPass\n\nLoans in these categories are performing as expected with low to average risk.\n\nSpecial Mention\n\nLoans in this category are internally designated by management as “watch loans.” These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are closely monitored by management.\n\nSubstandard\n\nLoans in this category are internally designated by management as “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the obligors or the current net worth of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans present a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain losses if such weaknesses are _not_ corrected.\n\nDoubtful\n\nLoans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those designated as “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses _may_ make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\n\nOn an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Bank formally reviews the ratings on commercial loans. In addition, the Bank performs an independent review of a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. Management uses the results of the independent review as part of its annual review process.\n\n_12_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe following tables present the credit risk profile of the

Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of _three_ levels of inputs that _may_ be used to measure fair value:\n\n**Level _1_** |  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  \n---|---  \n**Level _2_** |  Observable inputs other than Level _1_ prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are _not_ active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  \n---|---  \n**Level _3_** |  Unobservable inputs supported by little or _no_ market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  \n---|---  \n  \nAn asset’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been _no_ changes in the methodologies used at _September 30, 2024_ or _December 31, 2023_.\n\nSecurities available for sale (Recurring)\n\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities such as U.S. Treasuries, would be classified within Level _1_ of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are _not_ available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but _not_ limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level _2_ of the valuation hierarchy. In certain cases where Level _1_ or Level _2_ inputs are _not_ available, securities would be classified within Level _3_ of the hierarchy.\n\n_18_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe following table presents the Bank’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**____Fair Value Measurements Using____**  \n---  \n**_Fair Value_** |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**September 30, 2024**  \nSecurities available-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury Notes | $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —  \nU.S. government agency obligations | 8,928| —| 8,928| —  \nMunicipal obligations | 12,214| —| 12,214| —  \nMortgage-backed residential obligations | 28,044| —| 28,044| —  \nCollateralized mortgage obligations | 26,054| —| 26,054| —  \nTotal | $| 75,240| $| —| $| 75,240| $| —  \n**December 31, 2023**  \nSecurities available-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury Notes | $| 2,973| $| 2,973| $| —| $| —  \nU.S. government agency obligations | 9,106| —| 9,106| $| —  \nMunicipal obligations | 13,570| —| 13,570| —  \nMortgage-backed residential obligations | 30,351| —| 30,351| —  \nCollateralized mortgage obligations | 26,135| —| 26,135| —  \nTotal | $| 82,135| $| 2,973| $| 79,162| $| —  \n  \nThe Bank _may_ be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The following disclosures include financial instruments that are _not_ carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of estimated fair values is based on market conditions at a specific point in time and _may_ _not_ reflect current or future fair values. \n\nCertain financial instruments generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and have _no_ stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The carrying value of these financial instruments assumes to approximate the fair value of these instruments. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, non-interest bearing deposit accounts, time deposits with other financial institutions, FHLB stock, escrow deposits and accrued interest receivable and payable. \n\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments are as follows: \n\n**_Carrying_** |  **_Estimated_**  \n---|---  \n**_Amount_** |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_** |  **_Fair Value_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**September 30, 2024**  \nFinancial assets:  \nLoans, net | $| 133,811| $| —| $| —| $| 126,382| $| 126,382  \nLoans held for sale | 3,120| —| 3,182| —| 3,182  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nInterest-bearing deposits | $| 169,288| $| —| $| 169,734| $| —| $| 169,734  \nOther Borrowings | 5,000| —| 5,025| —| 5,025  \n**December 31, 2023**  \nFinancial assets:  \nLoans, net | $| 120,623| $| —| $| —| $| 110,288| $| 110,288  \nLoans held for sale | 380| —| 387| —| 387  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nInterest-bearing deposits | $| 156,402| $| —| $| 156,092| $| —| $| 156,092  \nOther Borrowings | 5,000| —| 4,990| —| 4,990  \n  \n**Note _8:_ Capital Ratios**\n\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulatory reporting requirements and regulatory capital standards. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\n\nQuantitative measures established by regulatory reporting standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier _1_ capital to total risk-weighted assets and of Tier I capital to average assets, as such individual components and calculations are defined by related standards.\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ the most recent notification from the regulators categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are _no_ conditions or events since that notification which management believes have changed the Bank’s category. On _November 13, 2019,_ the federal regulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”), which became effective on _January 1, 2020._ The intent of CBLR is to provide a simple alternative measure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, as directed under the Economic Growth, Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier _1_ capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds _9%_ subject to a limited _two_ quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot drop _100_ basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will _not_ be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. The Bank elected to begin using CBLR for the _first_ quarter of _2020._ Management believes, as of _September 30, 2024_ , that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject.\n\n_20_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , are presented below:\n\n**__Minimum Required to be__**  \n---  \n**__Actual__** |  **__Well-Capitalized (1)__**  \n**_Amount_** |  **_Ratio_** |  **_Amount_** |  **_Ratio_**  \n**As of September 30, 2024** |  **____(Dollars in thousands)____**  \nTier 1 capital (to Average Assets) | $| 63,962| 23.96| %| $| 24,026| >9%  \n**As of December 31, 2023**  \nTier 1 capital (to Average Assets) | $| 63,258| 24.72| %| $| 23,031| >9%  \n  \n(_1_) As defined by regulatory agencies. Failure to exceed the leverage ratio thresholds required under CBLR in the future, subject to any applicable grace period, would require the Bank to return to the risk-based capital ratio thresholds previously utilized under the fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules to determine capital adequacy.\n\n**Note _9:_ Commitments and Contingencies**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank has various commitments and contingent liabilities that are _not_ reflected in the accompanying financial statements. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is _not_ expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Bank.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nThe Bank does _not_ engage in the use of interest rate swaps or futures, forwards or option contracts.\n\nAt _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , unused lines of credit and outstanding commitments to originate loans were as follows:\n\n**_September 30, 2024_** |  **_December 31, 2023_**  \n---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nUnused line of credit | $| 8,242| $| 4,050  \nCommitments to originate loans | 2,506| 3,770  \nTotal commitments | $| 10,748| $| 7,820  \n  \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nThe Bank generally originates single-family residential loans within its primary lending area which is Waukegan, Illinois and the surrounding area. The Bank’s underwriting policies require such loans to be made at approximately 80% loan-to-value, based upon appraised values, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained, or the loan is guaranteed by the government. These loans are secured by the underlying properties.\n\nThe Bank maintains its cash in deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank or other institutions, the balances of which _may_ exceed federally insured limits. The Bank has _not_ experienced any losses in such accounts. The Bank believes it is _not_ exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Bank assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, fair values of its financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, and that change _may_ be either favorable or unfavorable to the Bank. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the overall interest rate risk.\n\nLitigation\n\nDue to the nature of its business activities, the Bank is at times subject to legal action which arises in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is _not_ expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Bank.\n\n_21_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**[](# \"Note 11\")Note _10:_ Earnings Per Share**\n\nBasic EPS represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares (such as stock options) were exercised or converted into additional common shares that should then share in the earnings of the entity. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, plus the effect of potential dilutive common share equivalents. \n\nThere were no securities or other contracts that had a dilutive effect for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023,_ and therefore the weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted EPS are the same. Shares held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") that have _not_ been allocated to employees in accordance with the terms of the ESOP, referred to as \"unallocated ESOP shares\", are _not_ deemed outstanding for EPS calculations. \n\n**__Three Months Ended September 30,__** |  **__Nine months ended September 30,__**  \n---|---  \n**_2024_** |  **_2023_** |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \n**(Income in thousands)** |  **(Income in thousands)**  \nNet loss applicable to common shares | $| (171| )| $| (232| )| $| (743| )| $| (188| )  \nAverage number of common shares outstanding | 5,284,380| 5,490,825| 5,302,574| 5,422,851  \nLess: Average unallocated ESOP shares | 375,876| 397,238| 381,129| 402,589  \nAverage number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic loss per common share | 4,908,504| 5,093,587| 4,921,445| 5,020,262  \nLoss per common share basic and diluted | $| (0.03| )| $| (0.05| )| $| (0.15| )| $| (0.04| )  \n  \nAll unallocated ESOP shares have been excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

The ESOP borrowed funds from the Company to purchase 431,836 shares of stock at $10 per share. The Bank makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP, as well as paying dividends on unallocated shares to the ESOP, and the ESOP uses funds it receives to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants based on relative compensation. Participants receive the shares at the end of employment. Dividends on allocated shares increase participants accounts. \n\nThere were no contributions to the ESOP during the _first_ _nine_ months of _2024,_ as the annual loan payment will be made during the _fourth_ quarter. Expense recorded was $154,000 and $152,000 for the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, and $52,000 and $50,000 for the _three_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023,_ respectively, and is recognized over the service period. \n\nShares held by the ESOP were as follows: \n\n**__As of September 30,__**  \n---  \n**_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nShares allocated | 43,624| 22,009  \nShares committed for allocation | 15,885| 16,212  \nUnallocated | 372,327| 393,615  \nTotal ESOP shares | 431,836| 431,836  \nFair value of unearned shares as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively | $| 3,854| $| 3,562  \n  \nFair value of unearned shares is based on a stock price of $10.35 and $9.05 as of _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively. \n\n**_Equity Incentive Plan_**\n\nAt the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on _May 24, 2023,_ stockholders approved the NSTS Bancorp, Inc. _2023_ Equity Incentive Plan (_“2023_ Equity Plan”), which provides for the granting of up to 755,714 shares (215,918 shares of restricted stock and 539,796 shares available for future grants of stock options) of the Company’s common stock pursuant to equity awards made under the _2023_ Equity Plan.\n\nStock options granted under the _2023_ Equity Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a service period of five years beginning on the date of grant. The vesting of the options accelerates upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control of the Company. Stock options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, and have an expiration period of ten years. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has 74,296 shares available for future grants of stock options under the _2023_ Equity Plan. \n\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Upon exercise of vested options, management expects to _first_ draw on treasury stock as the source for shares. \n\n_23_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the periods presented. \n\n**Stock Option** |  **_Shares_** |  **_Weighted Average Exercise Price_** |  **Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 | 465,500| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nForfeited | —| —  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 | 465,500| $| 9.36|  _N/A_  \nExercisable - End of Period | —  \nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 | 465,500| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nExercised | 23,000| 9.36  \nForfeited | —| —  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 | 442,500| $| 9.36| $| 438  \nExercisable - End of Period | 88,500| 9.36| 88  \n**Stock Option** |  **_Shares_** |  **_Weighted Average Exercise Price_** |  **Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 | —| $| —  \nGranted | 465,500| 9.36  \nForfeited | —| —  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 | 465,500| $| 9.36|  _N/A_  \nExercisable - End of Period | —  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 | 465,500| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nExercised | 23,000| 9.36  \nForfeited | —| —  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 | 442,500| $| 9.36| $| 438  \nExercisable - End of Period | 88,500| 9.36| 88  \n  \n(_1_) Dollars in thousands. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable options at _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ were calculated based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock of _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ of $10.35 and $9.05, respectively, per share less the exercise price. \n\nExpected future expense relating to the non-vested options outstanding as of _September 30, 2024_ is $1.2 million over a weighted average period of 3.7 years. As of _September 30, 2024,_ the Company had 442,500 in outstanding stock options with a weighted average remaining life of 8.7 years outstanding. \n\n_24_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nRestricted shares granted under the _2023_ Equity Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a service period of five years beginning on the date of grant. The vesting of the awards accelerates upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control of the Company. The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date closing market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted shares under the _2023_ Equity Plan. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has 28,718 shares of restricted stock available for future grants under the _2023_ Equity Plan. \n\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company's restricted shares as of _September 30, 2024_ and changes thereto during the periods presented. \n\n**Restricted Stock** |  **_Shares_** |  **_Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value_**  \n---|---|---  \nNonvested balance as of June 30, 2023 | 187,200| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nForfeited | —| —  \nNonvested balance as of September 30, 2023 | 187,200| $| 9.36  \nNonvested balance as of June 30, 2024 | 142,400| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nVested | —| —  \nForfeited | —| —  \nNonvested balance as of September 30, 2024 | 142,400| $| 9.36  \n**Restricted Stock** |  **_Shares_** |  **_Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value_**  \n---|---|---  \nNonvested balance as of December 31, 2022 | —| $| —  \nGranted | 187,200| 9.36  \nForfeited | —| —  \nNonvested balance as of September 30, 2023 | 187,200| $| 9.36  \nNonvested balance as of December 31, 2023 | 178,000| $| 9.36  \nGranted | —| —  \nVested | 35,600| 9.36  \nForfeited | —| —  \nNonvested balance as of September 30, 2024 | 142,400| $| 9.36  \n  \nExpected future expense related to the non-vested restricted shares outstanding as of period end is $1.2 million over a weighted average period of 3.7 years. \n\nThe following table presents the stock based compensation expense for the periods presented. \n\n**__Three Months Ended September 30,__** |  **__Nine months ended September 30,__**  \n---|---  \n**_2024_** |  **_2023_** |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)** |  **(Dollars in thousands)**  \nStock option expense | $| 79| $| 82| $| 236| $| 96  \nRestricted stock expense | 83| 88| 250| 102  \nTotal stock based compensation expense | $| 162| $| 170| $| 486| $| 198  \n  \n_25_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**[](# \"mda\")ITEM** **2.

(“the Company”) became the holding company for North Shore Trust and Savings (“the Bank”) when North Shore MHC completed its conversion into the stock holding company form of organization. Shares of the Company's common stock began trading on January 19, 2022 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol “NSTS.”\n\n**_NSTS Bancorp,_** ** _Inc._**\n\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc. is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated in September 2021. As a savings and loan holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”). The Company’s primary business activities relate to owning all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank.\n\nThe unaudited financial statements and other financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with NSTS Bancorp, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n**_North Shore Trust and Savings_**\n\nNorth Shore Trust and Savings, a federally-chartered stock savings institution, was established in 1921 as North Shore Building and Loan, an Illinois-chartered institution. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTS Bancorp, Inc., and operates as a traditional savings institution focused primarily on serving the banking needs of customers in our market area of Lake County, Illinois and adjacent communities. We operate from our headquarters and main banking office in Waukegan, Illinois, as well as two additional full-service branch offices located in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, we added additional loan production offices in Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois to complement the existing loan production office in Chicago, Illinois. Our primary business activity is attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and purchase investments. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”).\n\n**_Our Business and Franchise_**\n\nFor over 100 years, we have served Lake County, Illinois and the surrounding communities. We have established deep ties to the community and developed customer relationships which have spanned generations. We pride ourselves in matching our products and services to the needs of the community.\n\nOur principal business consists of originating loans for one- to four-family residential properties, multi-family and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and to a lesser extent home equity loans and lines of credit, construction loans, and other consumer loans in the market areas surrounding our branch footprint. We also established a loan production office in Chicago, Illinois in 2016 to originate loans outside of our branch network in a more densely populated metropolitan area, which we believe benefits us geographically. To complement the existing offices, during the third quarter of 2023, we established two additional loan production offices in Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois to expand our loan originations within the Chicagoland area. The lending teams operating in the Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois loan production offices originate as Oak Leaf Community Mortgage, a division of North Shore Trust and Savings. We attract retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our main office and branches, offering a wide variety of deposit products. We also invest in investment securities. Our revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans, noninterest income from the sale of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and interest on investments. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated unaudited interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nOf the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain items as critical accounting policies based on the associated estimates, assumptions, judgments and complexity. See “ _Management_ ’ _s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ — _Critical Accounting Policies_ ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n28 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding our consolidated company and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements. As such, this discussion should be read carefully and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report.\n\nOur results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for credit losses, fee income and other noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest expense principally consists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and business promotion and other expenses. We expect that our noninterest expenses will increase as we grow and expand our operations. Our results of operations and financial condition are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes in accounting guidance, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\n\n**Average Balances, Net Interest Income, and Yields Earned and Rates Paid.** The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. All average balances are based on daily balances. The table also reflects the yields on the Company’s interest-earning assets and costs of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown.\n\n29 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**For the Three

MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n**_General._** For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $171,000, compared to a net loss of $232,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $743,000, compared to a net loss of $188,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss for the three-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income, specifically related to the gain on sale of mortgages. The increase in net loss, for the nine-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest expenses related to the continued investment in people and processes with the expansion of the mortgage lending team, Oak Leaf Community Mortgage. This increase is partially offset by an increase in noninterest income specifically related to the gain on loans held for sale and an increase in net interest income driven by increased interest income on loans and interest income on funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\n\n**_Net Interest Income._** Net interest income increased $314,000, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest rate spread increased to 2.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.24% for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin increased to 2.96% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.59% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases are driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets of $247.1 million in the third quarter 2024 increased $12.8 million compared to $234.3 million for the third quarter 2023. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in average deposit balances during the period. The average outstanding balance of loans, net, increased to $135.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $29.1 million from $106.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield earned on those loans outstanding increased 125 basis points to 5.31% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in market rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as increased loan demand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and with additional origination fees.\n\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 89 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market. \n\nNet interest income increased $591,000, to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest rate spread decreased to 2.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.42% for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin increased to 2.90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest rate spread is driven by an increased average balance of higher earning interest-bearing liabilities, specifically interest-bearing deposits, as a percentage of total assets. The increase in the interest margin is driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets of $244.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $8.8 million compared to $235.9 million for the same period ending September 30, 2023. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in average deposit balances during the period and reduction in investment securities. The average outstanding balance of loans, net increased to $131.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $26.7 million from $105.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield earned on those loans outstanding increased 109 basis points to 5.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in market rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as an increased loan demand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and with additional origination fees.\n\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 99 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses._** For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a provision for credit losses was recorded based on the current allowance for credit loss (\"ACL\") assessment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $20,000, comprised of $4,000 in provision for credit losses to loans and $16,000 in provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments, including loans committed for origination. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $50,000, comprised of $51,000 in provision for credit losses on loans and a $1,000 reversal of provision of credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $142,000, comprised of $95,000 provision for credit losses on loans and $47,000 provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $52,000, comprised of $53,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a $1,000 reversal of provision of credit losses related to unfunded commitments.\n\nWe will continue to assess and evaluate the estimated future credit loss impact of current market conditions in subsequent reporting periods, which will be highly dependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, as well as the composition of our loan and available-for-sale securities portfolios.\n\n32 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Noninterest Income._** The following table shows the components of noninterest income for the periods presented.\n\n**Three months ended September 30,** |  **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Noninterest income:** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nGain on sale of mortgage loans | $ | 268 | $ | — | $ | 695 | $ | 13  \nRental income on office building | 16 | 16 | 48 | 48  \nService charges on deposits | 67 | 70 | 192 | 203  \nIncrease in cash surrender value of BOLI | 56 | 49 | 162 | 141  \nOther | 16 | 15 | 139 | 39  \nTotal noninterest income | $ | 423 | $ | 150 | $ | 1,236 | $ | 444  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased $273,000 to $423,000 from $150,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased $792,000 from $444,000 to $1.2 million. In each case, the increases were driven by an increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans and an increase in other noninterest income. Other noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased as a result of insurance recovery funds received, totaling $70,000, due to damage from an accident that occurred at one of the branches. Management anticipates the costs associated with the capital improvements will exceed that of the funds received as additional necessary upgrades will be made concurrently.\n\nGain on sale of mortgages increased $268,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Gain on sale of mortgage loans increased $682,000, from $13,000 to $695,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in gain on sale of mortgages were primarily the result of an overall increase in total mortgage loans originated during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 125 loans totaling $33.3 million for a gain on sale of $695,000. Included in the number and amount of loans sold during the period were loans sold that were originated as held for investment, but subsequently sold to local community banks, totaling $2.5 million, for a total gain on sale of $79,000. Management continues to look for opportunities and markets to sell loans as we continue to see increased loan production compared to prior years.\n\n**_Noninterest Expense._** The following table shows the components of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\n\n**Three months ended September 30,** |  **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Noninterest expense:** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nSalaries and employee benefits | $ | 1,483 | $ | 1,162 | $ | 4,325 | $ | 3,095  \nEquipment and occupancy | 190 | 166 | 602 | 499  \nData processing | 212 | 159 | 624 | 481  \nProfessional services | 115 | 150 | 398 | 394  \nAdvertising | 60 | 14 | 235 | 65  \nSupervisory fees and assessments | 36 | 49 | 107 | 123  \nLoan expenses | 53 | 25 | 148 | 69  \nDeposit expenses | 63 | 56 | 175 | 163  \nDirector fees | 56 | 56 | 160 | 168  \nOther | 136 | 116 | 386 | 353  \nTotal noninterest expense | $ | 2,404 | $ | 1,953 | $ | 7,160 | $ | 5,410  \n  \nNoninterest expenses increased $451,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expenses increased $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. For both the three- and nine-month periods, the increase in noninterest expenses was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits. The average number of employees increased to 49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in headcount is based on the addition of the Oak Leaf Community Mortgage team brought on during the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as additional hires during 2024 to supplement the lending team as operations continue to expand. Additionally, the Company implemented the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan on June 15, 2023, and began recognizing expenses associated with this plan in June 2023, as such expenses were higher for the periods ended 2024 compared to 2023. Marketing and advertising costs increased during 2024 as a result of an increased focus on lending operations and related marketing to our new lending area, Will County, Illinois. Data processing expenses increased as we have continued to invest in systems and processes to improve the lending experience for our customers as well as implement efficiencies within our internal processes. Additionally, certain data processing expenses are based on per employee costs, which increased due to an increase in headcount. Loan expenses increased as a result of an increase in loan originations during the periods. Equipment and occupancy costs increased as a result of two additional loan production office rental agreements in place during 2024 that were not in place during the first nine months of 2023. Management intends to continue to invest in the people and processes in place to achieve efficiencies as loan production continues to grow.\n\n**_Provision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit)._** There was no provision for income tax expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management estimates a taxable net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to non-taxable income, such as income on tax exempt municipal securities and BOLI.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing net operating losses. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over the three-year period ended September 30, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, management maintained the full valuation allowance against the federal net operating losses and net deferred tax assets to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted.\n\n33 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023**\n\n**At September 30,** |  **At December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Selected Consolidated Financial Condition Data:**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 34,592 | $ | 31,388  \nSecurities available for sale | 75,240 | 82,135  \nFHLB stock | 585 | 550  \nLoans held for sale | 3,120 | 380  \nLoans, net | 133,811 | 120,623  \nTotal assets | 268,439 | 256,776  \nTotal deposits | 179,887 | 168,826  \nTotal equity | $ | 78,436 | $ | 77,545  \n  \n**_Total Assets_** _._ Total assets increased $11.7 million to $268.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in loans, net, funded by an increase in time deposits and a reduction in securities available for sale due to maturities and principal payments of securities.\n\n**_Cash and cash equivalents._** Cash and cash equivalents increased $3.2 million to $34.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from $31.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash was driven by an increase in time deposits during the same period and principal payments received on securities available for sale. Currently, the Bank holds a majority of the cash on hand at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, earning 4.90%, to keep the funds available for increasing loan demand. Management continues to actively monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis and maintain levels of liquid assets deemed adequate.\n\n**_Time deposits with other financial institutions._** Time deposits with other financial institutions decreased $500,000 to $1.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from $2.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in time deposits with other financial institutions was driven by maturities during the year to date. Management has been reinvesting the matured funds into lending activities, increasing the average yield on assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.16% compared to 3.19% for the same period ending September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Securities Available for Sale_**. Securities available-for-sale decreased to $75.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $82.1 million at December 31, 2023. There were no purchases or sales of securities available-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank received principal payments of $4.2 million, had maturities of $4.3 million, had net premium amortization and discount accretion of $393,000 and had a decrease in the unrealized loss on the portfolio of $2.0 million. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the securities available for sale portfolio included an unrealized loss position of $9.6 million, or 11.3% of the total book value of the portfolio. Management monitors the portfolio for credit losses and believes that the decline in value does not presently represent realized losses and is due to market volatility and increased market interest rates. While the Bank does not currently intend to sell securities in a loss position, management may consider the opportunity to reposition the investment securities portfolio in the future.\n\n**_Loans held for sale._** Our loans held for sale increased $2.7 million to $3.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $380,000 at December 31, 2023. With the addition of Oak Leaf Community Mortgage during the late third and early fourth quarters of 2023, and the related increase in loan originations, management has increased the proportion of loan originations held for sale to the secondary market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank originated $33.6 million in loans held for sale. \n\n**_Loans, net_**. Our loans, net, increased by $13.2 million to $133.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $120.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank originated $38.6 million in loans to be held in the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had loan principal payments and payoffs of $22.8 million. The Bank continues to focus lending efforts on one- to four-family residential properties, which has seen the largest increase in balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the balance of construction loans has decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, however, the current available balance on construction loans is $3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and is expected to be drawn upon within the next 12 months. In an effort to continue to grow loan originations, the Bank hired three additional mortgage loan originators during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank sold $2.5 million in loans that were originally held in the portfolio to local community banks. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) which includes the allowance for credit losses on loans, and the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures (recorded in Other Liabilities), totaled $1.3 million, an increase of $95,000 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL is driven by an increase in the portfolio loan balances. As of September 30, 2024, there were no loans individually assessed and no loans were rated substandard or watch. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has no non-accrual loans and two loan past due greater than 30 days. The Bank actively monitors the loan portfolio for signs of weakening credit quality, noting as of September 30, 2024 the portfolio remains of high quality with limited credit concerns. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of unfunded commitments increased as a result of an increase in the HELOCs and construction loans originated during the first nine months of 2024 and not yet drawn upon as well as in loans committed for origination.\n\n34 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Deposits_**. Total deposits increased $11.1 million to $179.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $168.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits is primarily within the time deposit accounts as the Bank continued to offer a competitive CD special during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on current offering rates in our market area and our current deposit pricing strategy, as well as our strong historical deposit retention, management anticipates that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. Management continues to actively monitor the deposit balances and interest rates offered to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.\n\nAdditionally, management notes the percentage of time deposit accounts greater than $250,000 as a percentage of total time deposits has increased to 20.4% as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The total balance of deposit accounts greater than $250,000 as of September 30, 2024 is $40.0 million, or 22.2% of total deposits. This represents an increase from December 31, 2023 of $34.3 million, or 20.3% of total deposits. Management works closely with depositors to reduce the uninsured balances through beneficiaries as well as to ensure depositors understand the risks. \n\n**_Total Equity_**. Total equity increased $891,000 to $78.4 million at September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized loss position on the securities available-for-sale portfolio. The decrease in the unrealized loss position of $1.4 million, net of the related tax effect, is due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, the Bank began repurchasing treasury stock during the second quarter 2024, resulting in an additional $411,000 of treasury stock as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.\n\n35 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_**Asset Quality**_\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our nonperforming assets. The decrease in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was the result of payoffs or payment requirements met bringing the loans off of non-accrual as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**At September 30,** |  **At December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nNonaccrual loans | $ | — | $ | 200  \nLoans 90+ days past due and accruing | 264 | —  \nTotal non-performing loans | 264 | 200  \nOther real estate owned, net | — | —  \nTotal non-performing assets | $ | 264 | $ | 200  \n**Asset Quality Ratios:(1)**  \nNon-accrual loans as a percent of total loans outstanding | — | % | 0.17 | %  \nNon-performing assets as a percent of total assets | 0.10 | % | 0.08 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of total loans outstanding | 0.95 | % | 0.97 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of non-performing loans(2) | 481.44 | % | 588.00 | %  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans receivable | — | % | — | %  \n(1) |  Asset quality ratios and capital ratios are end of period ratios, except for net charge-offs to average loans receivable.  \n---|---  \n(2) |  Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans and loans that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing.  \n  \nThe allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans as of September 30, 2024 was 0.95%. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2023 was 0.97%. \n\n36 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nThe Bank maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.\n\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Chicago and a $10.0 million unsecured Fed Funds line of credit with BMO Harris Bank. At September 30, 2024, we had one outstanding advance from the FHLB of Chicago totaling $5.0 million and had the capacity to borrow approximately $78.1 million additional from the FHLB of Chicago. Additionally, we had no outstanding balance under our $10.0 million federal funds line of credit with BMO Harris Bank.\n\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\n\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $74,000 and $363,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and net change in investment securities, was $(7.0) million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increase in cash used in 2024 driven by the increase in the portfolio loans. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts was $10.2 million and $(10.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024, totaled $54.0 million. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB of Chicago advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank elected to begin using the CBLR. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 9%, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. North Shore Trust and Savings’ Tier 1 capital to Average Assets was 23.96% and 24.72% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\n**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_** _._ At September 30, 2024, we had $2.5 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Our total letters and lines of credit and unused lines of credit totaled $8.2 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Commitments**. The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Total Amounts Committed at** |  **Amount of Commitment Expiration – Per Period**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **To 1 Year** |  **1-3 Years** |  **4-5 Years** |  **After 5 Years**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nUnused line of credit | $ | 8,242 | $ | 305 | $ | 693 | $ | 956 | $ | 6,288  \nCommitments to originate loans | 2,506 | 2,506 | — | — | —  \nTotal commitments | $ | 10,748 | $ | 2,811 | $ | 693 | $ | 956 | $ | 6,288  \n  \n**Contractual Cash Obligations**.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\n\n**Changes in Accounting Principles**\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards” (ASU 2024-01). ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\n\n**[](# \"quantitative\")ITEM** **3.

Financial Statements\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”) and conform to practices within the banking industry. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial\nstatements are consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual financial statements. The interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring\nadjustments that are necessary, in the opinion of management, for fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. Results for the three and nine month periods\nended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nNature of Operations\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc. (“NSTS” or the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was formed to serve as the stock holding company for North Shore Trust and Savings (the “Bank”) in\nconnection with the conversion of North Shore Trust and Savings, NSTS Financial Corporation and North Shore MHC, into the stock form of organization, which was\ncompleted on January 18, 2022. Shares of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. stock began trading on January 19, 2022 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol \"NSTS.\"\nThe Bank operates primarily out of three bank branch locations in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. In efforts to expand our loan originations within the\nChicagoland area, the Bank also has three loan production offices, located in Chicago, Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois. The lending team operates as Oak Leaf Community\nMortgage, powered by North Shore Trust and Savings. The Bank offers a variety of financial services to customers in our surrounding community. Financial services consist\nprimarily of 1-4 family mortgage loans, savings accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. There are no significant concentrations of loans to any one industry or\ncustomer. The Bank’s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the Bank’s market area.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation\nS-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc.’s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nManagement is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates. Material\nestimates that could significantly change in the near-term include the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, determination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax\nassets and the valuation of investment securities and the related tax effect. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not\nnecessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Certain amounts in prior year\nfinancial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of issuance of the unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements. No significant subsequent events have occurred through this date requiring adjustment to the financial statements or disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards” (ASU\n2024-01). ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards should be\naccounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated\nstatements of income.\n8\nTable of Contents\nNote 2: Securities Available for Sale\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, are shown below. The accrued\ninterest receivable for securities available for sale was $244,000 and $351,000 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Maturities may differ from\ncontractual maturities in mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or repaid without any penalties, therefore, these\nsecurities have been included in the below table based on average remaining life.\nU.S. Mortgage-\nU.S. government backed Collateralized Total\nTreasury agency Municipal residential mortgage available-\nSeptember 30, 2024 Notes obligations obligations obligations obligations for-sale\n(Dollars in thousands)\n1 year or less $ — $ 999 $ — $ — $ — $ 999\n1 to 5 years — 3,154 1,470 9,704 13,756 28,084\n5 to 10 years — 4,775 1,282 17,099 10,152 33,308\nAfter 10 years — — 9,462 1,241 2,146 12,849\nFair value — 8,928 12,214 28,044 26,054 75,240\nGross unrealized gains — — — — — —\nGross unrealized losses — (848) (1,901) (3,646) (3,155) (9,550)\nAmortized cost $ — $ 9,776 $ 14,115 $ 31,690 $ 29,209 $ 84,790\nU.S. Mortgage-\nU.S. government backed Collateralized Total\nTreasury agency Municipal residential mortgage available-\nDecember 31, 2023 Notes obligations obligations obligations obligations for-sale\n(Dollars in thousands)\n1 year or less $ 2,973 $ — $ 1,292 $ — $ — $ 4,265\n1 to 5 years — 4,769 1,461 8,976 12,919 28,125\n5 to 10 years — 4,337 882 19,777 9,756 34,752\nAfter 10 years — — 9,935 1,598 3,460 14,993\nFair value 2,973 9,106 13,570 30,351 26,135 82,135\nGross unrealized gains — — 1 — — 1\nGross unrealized losses (22) (1,128) (1,882) (4,533) (3,938) (11,503)\nAmortized cost $ 2,995 $ 10,234 $ 15,451 $ 34,884 $ 30,073 $ 93,637\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no securities were pledged to secure public deposits or for other purposes as required or permitted by law.\nInformation pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregated by investment category and length of time that\nindividual securities have been in a continuous loss position, is as follows:\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nValue Losses Value Losses Value Losses\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S. Treasury Notes $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nU.S. government agency obligations — — 8,928 848 8,928 848\nMunicipal obligations 484 10 11,730 1,891 12,214 1,901\nMortgage-backed residential obligations — — 28,044 3,646 28,044 3,646\nCollateralized mortgage obligations — — 26,054 3,155 26,054 3,155\nTotal $ 484 $ 10 $ 74,756 $ 9,540 $ 75,240 $ 9,550\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury Notes $ — $ — $ 2,973 $ 22 $ 2,973 $ 22\nU.S. government agency obligations — — 9,106 1,128 9,106 1,128\nMunicipal obligations 279 1 12,796 1,881 13,075 1,882\nMortgage-backed residential obligations — — 30,351 4,533 30,351 4,533\nCollateralized mortgage obligations — — 26,135 3,938 26,135 3,938\nTotal $ 279 $ 1 $ 81,361 $ 11,502 $ 81,640 $ 11,503\n9\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, certain investment securities were in unrealized loss positions. There were no securities with identified credit losses at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because, based on management's evaluation, the decline\nin fair value is largely due to increased market rates, temporary market conditions and trading spreads, and, as such, are considered to be temporary by the Bank. In\naddition, management has the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or they recover their carrying values.\nAll U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-based residential obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are agency-issued or government-\nsponsored enterprise issued. Agency-issued securities are generally guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association.\nGovernment-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Small Business\nAdministration, have either a direct or implied guarantee by the U.S. government.\nThe Bank holds two classifications of municipal bonds, general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are backed by the general revenue of the\nissuing municipality, while revenue bonds are supported by a specific revenue source. All general obligation and revenue bonds have a bond rating of investment grade by\nStandard and Poor's or Moody's Investor Services or are not rated. There have been no declines in investment grades on bonds in a loss position and as of September 30,\n2024, all municipal bonds are paying as agreed.\nThere were no sales of securities available-for-sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 3: Loans and allowance for credit losses\nA summary of loans by major category as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFirst mortgage loans\n1-4 family residential $ 125,052 $ 111,081\nMulti-family 3,539 3,111\nCommercial 4,152 3,835\nConstruction 1,380 2,508\nTotal first mortgage loans 134,123 120,535\nConsumer loans 275 248\nTotal loans 134,398 120,783\nNet deferred loan costs 684 1,016\nAllowance for credit losses on loans (1,271) (1,176)\nTotal loans, net $ 133,811 $ 120,623\nFirst mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying balance sheets.

Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the loans serviced were $116,000\nand $231,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe accrued interest receivable for loans, net, was $566,000 and $392,000 for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively\nIn the normal course of business, loans are made by the Bank to directors and officers of the Company and the Bank (related parties). The terms of these loans, including\ninterest rate and collateral, are similar to those prevailing for comparable transactions with other customers and do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, such borrowers were indebted to the Bank in the aggregate amount of $535,000 and $550,000, respectively.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n1-4 family\nresidential Multi-family Commercial Construction Consumer Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended\nBeginning balance $ 1,165 $ 36 $ 41 $ 24 $ 1 $ 1,267\nCharge-offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) — — — — — —\n(Release of) Provision for credit losses (1) 3 1 — 1 4\nEnding balance $ 1,164 $ 39 $ 42 $ 24 $ 2 $ 1,271\nSeptember 30, 2024\n1-4 family\nresidential Multi-family Commercial Construction Consumer Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNine months ended\nBeginning balance $ 1,094 $ 40 $ 37 $ 4 $ 1 $ 1,176\nCharge-offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) — — — — — —\nProvision for (release of ) credit losses 70 (1) 5 20 1 95\nEnding balance $ 1,164 $ 39 $ 42 $ 24 $ 2 $ 1,271\nSeptember 30, 2023\n1-4 family\nresidential Multi-family Commercial Construction Consumer Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended\nBeginning balance $ 928 $ 41 $ 39 $ — $ 2 $ 1,010\nCharge-offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) — — — — — —\nProvision for (release of ) credit losses 56 (2) (3) — — 51\nEnding balance $ 984 $ 39 $ 36 $ — $ 2 $ 1,061\nSeptember 30, 2023\n1-4 family\nresidential Multi-family Commercial Construction Consumer Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNine months ended\nBeginning balance $ 581 $ 19 $ 19 $ — $ 5 $ 624\nCumulative effect of change in accounting\nprinciple 335 23 29 — (3) 384\nCharge-offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) — — — — — —\nProvision for (release of ) credit losses 68 (3) (12) — — 53\nEnding balance $ 984 $ 39 $ 36 $ — $ 2 $ 1,061\nThe ACL on loans excludes $60,000 and $4,000 of allowance for off-balance sheet exposures as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded within Other\nLiabilities. The provision for credit losses excludes $16,000 and $47,000 related to off-balance sheet exposures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no collateral dependent loans. As of December 31, 2023, collateral dependent loans totaled $200,000 in the one to four-family\nresidential loan segment. These loans are collateralized by residential real estate and have no ACL as of December 31, 2023. There were no other collateral dependent loans\nas of December 31, 2023.\nThe Bank evaluates collectability based on payment activity and other factors. The Bank uses a graded loan rating system as a means of identifying potential problem loans,\nas follows:\nPass\nLoans in these categories are performing as expected with low to average risk.\nSpecial Mention\nLoans in this category are internally designated by management as “watch loans.” These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are closely monitored by\nmanagement.\nSubstandard\nLoans in this category are internally designated by management as “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying\ncapacity of the obligors or the current net worth of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans present a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain losses if such\nweaknesses are not corrected.\nDoubtful\nLoans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those designated as “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses may make collection or\nliquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\nOn an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Bank formally reviews the ratings on commercial loans. In addition, the Bank performs an independent review of a\nsignificant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. Management uses the results of the independent review as part of its annual review process.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio based on risk rating category and year of origination as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted to\nloans term loans\namortized amortized\n2024 2023 2022 2021 Prior cost basis cost basis Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\n1-4 family residential\nPass $ 19,220 $ 22,310 $ 17,575 $ 18,295 $ 44,242 $ 3,410 $ — 125,052\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nTotal 1-4 family residential 19,220 22,310 17,575 18,295 44,242 3,410 — 125,052\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-\noffs — — — — — — — —\nMulti-family\nPass 517 — — 232 2,790 — — 3,539\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nTotal multi-family 517 — — 232 2,790 — — 3,539\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-\noffs — — — — — — — —\nCommercial\nPass 83 179 — 97 3,171 622 — 4,152\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nTotal commercial 83 179 — 97 3,171 622 — 4,152\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-\noffs — — — — — — — —\nConstruction\nPass 999 381 — — — — — 1,380\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nTotal construction 999 381 — — — — — 1,380\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-\noffs — — — — — — — —\nConsumer\nPass 106 84 64 20 1 — — 275\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nTotal consumer 106 84 64 20 1 — — 275\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-\noffs — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 20,925 $ 22,954 $ 17,639 $ 18,644 $ 50,204 $ 4,032 $ — $ 134,398\n13\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted to\nloans term loans\namortized amortized\n2023 2022 2021 Prior cost basis cost basis Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\n1-4 family residential\nPass $ 23,395 $ 18,950 $ 19,605 $ 47,517 $ 1,414 $ — $ 110,881\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — 200 — — 200\nTotal 1-4 family residential 23,395 18,950 19,605 47,717 1,414 — 111,081\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-offs — — — — — — —\nMulti-family\nPass — — 239 2,872 — — 3,111\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — —\nTotal multi-family — — 239 2,872 — — 3,111\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-offs — — — — — — —\nCommercial\nPass 186 — 100 3,399 150 — 3,835\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — —\nTotal commercial 186 — 100 3,399 150 — 3,835\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-offs — — — — — — —\nConstruction\nPass 2,508 — — — — — 2,508\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — —\nTotal construction 2,508 — — — — — 2,508\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-offs — — — — — — —\nConsumer\nPass 122 95 28 3 — — 248\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — —\nTotal consumer 122 95 28 3 — — 248\nCurrent year-to-date gross write-offs — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 26,211 $ 19,045 $ 19,972 $ 53,991 $ 1,564 $ — $ 120,783\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe aging of the Bank’s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is as follows:\n31-89 Days Greater than\nPast Due 90 Days Past Total Past\nand Due and Due and Total Loan\nAccruing Accruing Non-Accrual Non-Accrual Current Balance\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n1-4 family residential $ 99 $ 264 $ — $ 363 $ 124,689 $ 125,052\nMulti-family — — — — 3,539 3,539\nCommercial — — — — 4,152 4,152\nConstruction — — — — 1,380 1,380\nConsumer — — — — 275 275\nTotal $ 99 $ 264 $ — $ 363 $ 134,035 $ 134,398\nDecember 31, 2023\n1-4 family residential $ 131 $ — $ 200 $ 331 $ 110,750 $ 111,081\nMulti-family — — — $ — 3,111 $ 3,111\nCommercial — — — $ — 3,835 $ 3,835\nConstruction — — — $ — 2,508 $ 2,508\nConsumer — — — $ — 248 $ 248\nTotal $ 131 $ — $ 200 $ 331 $ 120,452 $ 120,783\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status recorded at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Fair\nvalue measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be\nused to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other\ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities\nAn asset’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at September 30,\n2024 or December 31, 2023.\nSecurities available for sale (Recurring)\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities such as U.S. Treasuries, would be classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted\nmarket prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and\npricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\nprepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or\nLevel 2 inputs are not available, securities would be classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the Bank’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements Using\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSecurities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury Notes $ — $ — $ — $ —\nU.S. government agency obligations 8,928 — 8,928 —\nMunicipal obligations 12,214 — 12,214 —\nMortgage-backed residential obligations 28,044 — 28,044 —\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 26,054 — 26,054 —\nTotal $ 75,240 $ — $ 75,240 $ —\nDecember 31, 2023\nSecurities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury Notes $ 2,973 $ 2,973 $ — $ —\nU.S. government agency obligations 9,106 — 9,106 $ —\nMunicipal obligations 13,570 — 13,570 —\nMortgage-backed residential obligations 30,351 — 30,351 —\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 26,135 — 26,135 —\nTotal $ 82,135 $ 2,973 $ 79,162 $ —\nThe Bank may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the\nend of the period. There were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n19\nTable of Contents\nNote 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments are classified within the fair value hierarchy using the methodologies described in Note 6 – Fair Value Measurements. The following disclosures\ninclude financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of estimated fair values is based on market conditions at a\nspecific point in time and may not reflect current or future fair values.\nCertain financial instruments generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that\napproximate market. The carrying value of these financial instruments assumes to approximate the fair value of these instruments. These instruments include cash and cash\nequivalents, non-interest bearing deposit accounts, time deposits with other financial institutions, FHLB stock, escrow deposits and accrued interest receivable and payable.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments are as follows:\nCarrying Estimated\nAmount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFinancial assets:\nLoans, net $ 133,811 $ — $ — $ 126,382 $ 126,382\nLoans held for sale 3,120 — 3,182 — 3,182\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 169,288 $ — $ 169,734 $ — $ 169,734\nOther Borrowings 5,000 — 5,025 — 5,025\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nLoans, net $ 120,623 $ — $ — $ 110,288 $ 110,288\nLoans held for sale 380 — 387 — 387\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 156,402 $ — $ 156,092 $ — $ 156,092\nOther Borrowings 5,000 — 4,990 — 4,990\nNote 8: Capital Ratios\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the\nregulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and\ncertain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulatory reporting requirements and\nregulatory capital standards. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and\nother factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulatory reporting standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the\ntable below) of total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets and of Tier I capital to average assets, as such\nindividual components and calculations are defined by related standards.\nAs of September 30, 2024 the most recent notification from the regulators categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction. There are no conditions or events since that notification which management believes have changed the Bank’s category. On November 13, 2019, the federal\nregulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The intent of\nCBLR is to provide a simple alternative measure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, as directed\nunder the Economic Growth, Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to\nuse such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage\nratio) exceeds 9% subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot drop 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will\nnot be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. The Bank elected to begin using CBLR for the first quarter of 2020. Management believes, as of September\n30, 2024, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are presented below:\nMinimum Required to be\nActual Well-Capitalized (1)\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of September 30, 2024 (Dollars in thousands)\nTier 1 capital (to Average Assets) $ 63,962 23.96% $ 24,026 >9%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTier 1 capital (to Average Assets) $ 63,258 24.72% $ 23,031 >9%\n(1) As defined by regulatory agencies. Failure to exceed the leverage ratio thresholds required under CBLR in the future, subject to any applicable grace period, would\nrequire the Bank to return to the risk-based capital ratio thresholds previously utilized under the fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules to determine capital adequacy.\nNote 9: Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank has various commitments and contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. In the\nopinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Bank.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Bank does not engage in the use of interest rate swaps or futures, forwards or option contracts.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unused lines of credit and outstanding commitments to originate loans were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nUnused line of credit $ 8,242 $ 4,050\nCommitments to originate loans 2,506 3,770\nTotal commitments $ 10,748 $ 7,820\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Bank generally originates single-family residential loans within its primary lending area which is Waukegan, Illinois and the surrounding area. The Bank’s underwriting\npolicies require such loans to be made at approximately 80% loan-to-value, based upon appraised values, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained, or the loan is\nguaranteed by the government. These loans are secured by the underlying properties.\nThe Bank maintains its cash in deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank or other institutions, the balances of which may exceed federally insured limits. The Bank has\nnot experienced any losses in such accounts. The Bank believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Bank assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, fair values of its financial\ninstruments will change when interest rate levels change, and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Bank. Management attempts to match maturities of\nassets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate\nenvironment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity\nin a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to\nminimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the overall interest rate risk.\nLitigation\nDue to the nature of its business activities, the Bank is at times subject to legal action which arises in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Bank.\n21\nTable of Contents\nNote 10: Earnings Per Share\nBasic EPS represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS\nreflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares (such as stock options) were exercised or converted into additional\ncommon shares that should then share in the earnings of the entity. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period, plus the effect of potential dilutive common share equivalents.\nThere were no securities or other contracts that had a dilutive effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore the weighted average\ncommon shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted EPS are the same. Shares held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") that have not been\nallocated to employees in accordance with the terms of the ESOP, referred to as \"unallocated ESOP shares\", are not deemed outstanding for EPS calculations.\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Income in thousands) (Income in thousands)\nNet loss applicable to common shares $ (171) $ (232) $ (743) $ (188)\nAverage number of common shares outstanding 5,284,380 5,490,825 5,302,574 5,422,851\nLess: Average unallocated ESOP shares 375,876 397,238 381,129 402,589\nAverage number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic loss per common\nshare 4,908,504 5,093,587 4,921,445 5,020,262\nLoss per common share basic and diluted $ (0.03) $ (0.05) $ (0.15) $ (0.04)\nAll unallocated ESOP shares have been excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes certain outstanding\nstock options that were outstanding and anti-dilutive, since the Company was in a loss position.\n22\nTable of Contents\nNote 11: Stock Based Compensation\nESOP\nEmployees participate in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\"). The ESOP borrowed funds from the Company to purchase 431,836 shares of stock at $10 per\nshare. The Bank makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP, as well as paying dividends on unallocated shares to the ESOP, and the ESOP uses funds it receives to\nrepay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants based on relative compensation. Participants receive the shares at the end of\nemployment. Dividends on allocated shares increase participants accounts.\nThere were no contributions to the ESOP during the first nine months of 2024, as the annual loan payment will be made during the fourth quarter. Expense recorded was\n$154,000 and $152,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $52,000 and $50,000 for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and is recognized over the service period.\nShares held by the ESOP were as follows:\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nShares allocated 43,624 22,009\nShares committed for allocation 15,885 16,212\nUnallocated 372,327 393,615\nTotal ESOP shares 431,836 431,836\nFair value of unearned shares as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively $ 3,854 $ 3,562\nFair value of unearned shares is based on a stock price of $10.35 and $9.05 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEquity Incentive Plan\nAt the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on May 24, 2023, stockholders approved the NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (“2023 Equity Plan”),\nwhich provides for the granting of up to 755,714 shares (215,918 shares of restricted stock and 539,796 shares available for future grants of stock options) of the Company’s\ncommon stock pursuant to equity awards made under the 2023 Equity Plan.\nStock options granted under the 2023 Equity Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a service period of five years beginning on the date of grant. The vesting\nof the options accelerates upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control of the Company. Stock options are generally granted at an\nexercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of\ngrant, and have an expiration period of ten years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 74,296 shares available for future grants of stock options under the 2023\nEquity Plan.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of\nthe awards. Upon exercise of vested options, management expects to first draw on treasury stock as the source for shares.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the periods presented.\nWeighted Average Aggregate Intrinsic\nStock Option Shares Exercise Price Value (1)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 465,500 $ 9.36\nGranted — —\nForfeited — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 465,500 $ 9.36 N/A\nExercisable - End of Period —\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 465,500 $ 9.36\nGranted — —\nExercised 23,000 9.36\nForfeited — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 442,500 $ 9.36 $ 438\nExercisable - End of Period 88,500 9.36 88\nWeighted Average Aggregate Intrinsic\nStock Option Shares Exercise Price Value (1)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 — $ —\nGranted 465,500 9.36\nForfeited — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 465,500 $ 9.36 N/A\nExercisable - End of Period —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 465,500 $ 9.36\nGranted — —\nExercised 23,000 9.36\nForfeited — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 442,500 $ 9.36 $ 438\nExercisable - End of Period 88,500 9.36 88\n(1) Dollars in thousands. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable options at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were calculated based on the closing market\nprice of the Company's common stock of September 30, 2024 and 2023 of $10.35 and $9.05, respectively, per share less the exercise price.\nExpected future expense relating to the non-vested options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is $1.2 million over a weighted average period of 3.7 years. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had 442,500 in outstanding stock options with a weighted average remaining life of 8.7 years outstanding.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRestricted shares granted under the 2023 Equity Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a service period of five years beginning on the date of grant.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section is intended to assist in the understanding of our financial performance through a discussion of our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and as\ncompared to our financial condition as of December 31, 2023, and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This section\nshould be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis filing contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “seek,”\n“expect” and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n● statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;\n● statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;\n● statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and\n● estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and\ncompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to\nfuture business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking\nstatements:\n● general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are different than expected;\n● changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses;\n● fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions;\n● inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, reduce the fair value of financial instruments or reduce the\norigination levels in our lending business, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans;\n● our ability to manage our liquidity and to access cost-effective funding, including significant fluctuations in our deposit accounts;\n● major catastrophes such as tornadoes, floods or other natural disasters, the related disruption to local, regional and global economic activity and\nfinancial markets, and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on us and our customers and other constituencies;\n● further data processing and other technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;\n● success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than expected;\n● interruptions involving information technology and communications systems of service providers;\n● breaches or failures of information security controls or cyber-related incidents;\n● demand for loans and deposits in our market area;\n● our ability to continue to implement our business strategies;\n● competition among depository and other financial institutions;\n● adverse changes in the securities markets;\n● changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements;\n● our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic conditions;\n● our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;\n● our ability to successfully integrate any assets, liabilities, customers, systems and management personnel we may acquire into our operations and our\nability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames and any goodwill charges related thereto;\n● changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;\n● changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n● our ability to hire and retain key employees and our reliance on our executive officers; and\n● our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees.\nBecause of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as\nrequired by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\n27\nTable of Contents\nGeneral\nOn January 18, 2022, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. (“the Company”) became the holding company for North Shore Trust and Savings (“the Bank”) when North Shore MHC\ncompleted its conversion into the stock holding company form of organization. Shares of the Company's common stock began trading on January 19, 2022 on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market under the trading symbol “NSTS.”\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc.\nNSTS Bancorp, Inc. is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated in September 2021. As a savings and loan holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is regulated by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”). The Company’s primary business activities relate to owning all of the outstanding shares of\ncapital stock of the Bank.\nThe unaudited financial statements and other financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with NSTS Bancorp,\nInc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNorth Shore Trust and Savings\nNorth Shore Trust and Savings, a federally-chartered stock savings institution, was established in 1921 as North Shore Building and Loan, an Illinois-chartered institution.\nThe Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTS Bancorp, Inc., and operates as a traditional savings institution focused primarily on serving the banking needs of customers\nin our market area of Lake County, Illinois and adjacent communities. We operate from our headquarters and main banking office in Waukegan, Illinois, as well as two\nadditional full-service branch offices located in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, we added additional loan production\noffices in Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois to complement the existing loan production office in Chicago, Illinois. Our primary business activity is attracting deposits from the\ngeneral public and using those funds to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and purchase investments. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and\nexamination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”).\nOur Business and Franchise\nFor over 100 years, we have served Lake County, Illinois and the surrounding communities. We have established deep ties to the community and developed customer\nrelationships which have spanned generations. We pride ourselves in matching our products and services to the needs of the community.\nOur principal business consists of originating loans for one- to four-family residential properties, multi-family and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and to\na lesser extent home equity loans and lines of credit, construction loans, and other consumer loans in the market areas surrounding our branch footprint. We also established\na loan production office in Chicago, Illinois in 2016 to originate loans outside of our branch network in a more densely populated metropolitan area, which we believe\nbenefits us geographically. To complement the existing offices, during the third quarter of 2023, we established two additional loan production offices in Aurora and\nPlainfield, Illinois to expand our loan originations within the Chicagoland area. The lending teams operating in the Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois loan production offices\noriginate as Oak Leaf Community Mortgage, a division of North Shore Trust and Savings. We attract retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our\nmain office and branches, offering a wide variety of deposit products. We also invest in investment securities. Our revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans,\nnoninterest income from the sale of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and interest on investments. Our primary sources of funds are\ndeposits, and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated unaudited interim financial statements for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements\nrequires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOf the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain items as critical accounting policies based\non the associated estimates, assumptions, judgments and complexity. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—\nCritical Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nThis discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding our consolidated company and may not contain all the information that is important to the\nreader. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements. As such, this discussion should be read\ncarefully and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report.\nOur results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and\ninterest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield\nearned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nResults of operations are also affected by our provisions for credit losses, fee income and other noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest expense principally\nconsists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and business promotion and other expenses. We expect that our noninterest\nexpenses will increase as we grow and expand our operations. Our results of operations and financial condition are also significantly affected by general economic and\ncompetitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes in accounting guidance, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income, and Yields Earned and Rates Paid.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $171,000, compared to a net loss of $232,000 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $743,000, compared to a net loss of $188,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in net loss for the three-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income, specifically related to the gain on sale of mortgages. The\nincrease in net loss, for the nine-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest expenses related to the continued investment in people and processes\nwith the expansion of the mortgage lending team, Oak Leaf Community Mortgage. This increase is partially offset by an increase in noninterest income specifically related\nto the gain on loans held for sale and an increase in net interest income driven by increased interest income on loans and interest income on funds held at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $314,000, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Our interest rate spread increased to 2.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.24% for the same period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Our net interest margin increased to 2.96% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.59% for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. These increases are driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.\nAverage interest-earning assets of $247.1 million in the third quarter 2024 increased $12.8 million compared to $234.3 million for the third quarter 2023. The increase in\naverage earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in average deposit balances during the period.\nThe average outstanding balance of loans, net, increased to $135.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $29.1 million from $106.2\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield earned on those loans outstanding increased 125 basis points to 5.31% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in market rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as increased loan\ndemand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and with additional origination fees.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 89 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market.\nNet interest income increased $591,000, to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4.7 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. Our interest rate spread decreased to 2.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.42% for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our net\ninterest margin increased to 2.90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\ninterest rate spread is driven by an increased average balance of higher earning interest-bearing liabilities, specifically interest-bearing deposits, as a percentage of total\nassets. The increase in the interest margin is driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.\nAverage interest-earning assets of $244.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $8.8 million compared to $235.9 million for the same period\nending September 30, 2023. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in\naverage deposit balances during the period and reduction in investment securities. The average outstanding balance of loans, net increased to $131.8 million for the nine-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $26.7 million from $105.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield\nearned on those loans outstanding increased 109 basis points to 5.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in\nmarket rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as an increased loan demand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and\nwith additional origination fees.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 99 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market.\nProvision for Credit Losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a provision for credit losses was recorded based on the current allowance for\ncredit loss (\"ACL\") assessment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $20,000, comprised of $4,000 in provision\nfor credit losses to loans and $16,000 in provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments, including loans committed for origination. During the three months\nended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $50,000, comprised of $51,000 in provision for credit losses on loans and a $1,000 reversal of\nprovision of credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $142,000,\ncomprised of $95,000 provision for credit losses on loans and $47,000 provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $52,000, comprised of $53,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a $1,000 reversal of provision of\ncredit losses related to unfunded commitments.\nWe will continue to assess and evaluate the estimated future credit loss impact of current market conditions in subsequent reporting periods, which will be highly\ndependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, as well as the composition of our loan and available-for-sale securities portfolios.\n32\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income. The following table shows the components of noninterest income for the periods presented.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\nNoninterest income: 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGain on sale of mortgage loans $ 268 $ — $ 695 $ 13\nRental income on office building 16 16 48 48\nService charges on deposits 67 70 192 203\nIncrease in cash surrender value of BOLI 56 49 162 141\nOther 16 15 139 39\nTotal noninterest income $ 423 $ 150 $ 1,236 $ 444\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased $273,000 to $423,000 from\n$150,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased $792,000 from $444,000\nto $1.2 million. In each case, the increases were driven by an increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans and an increase in other noninterest income. Other noninterest\nincome for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased as a result of insurance recovery funds received, totaling $70,000, due to damage from an accident that\noccurred at one of the branches. Management anticipates the costs associated with the capital improvements will exceed that of the funds received as additional necessary\nupgrades will be made concurrently.\nGain on sale of mortgages increased $268,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Gain on sale of mortgage loans increased $682,000,\nfrom $13,000 to $695,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in gain on sale of\nmortgages were primarily the result of an overall increase in total mortgage loans originated during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold\n125 loans totaling $33.3 million for a gain on sale of $695,000. Included in the number and amount of loans sold during the period were loans sold that were originated as\nheld for investment, but subsequently sold to local community banks, totaling $2.5 million, for a total gain on sale of $79,000. Management continues to look for\nopportunities and markets to sell loans as we continue to see increased loan production compared to prior years.\nNoninterest Expense. The following table shows the components of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\nNoninterest expense: 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 1,483 $ 1,162 $ 4,325 $ 3,095\nEquipment and occupancy 190 166 602 499\nData processing 212 159 624 481\nProfessional services 115 150 398 394\nAdvertising 60 14 235 65\nSupervisory fees and assessments 36 49 107 123\nLoan expenses 53 25 148 69\nDeposit expenses 63 56 175 163\nDirector fees 56 56 160 168\nOther 136 116 386 353\nTotal noninterest expense $ 2,404 $ 1,953 $ 7,160 $ 5,410\nNoninterest expenses increased $451,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expenses\nincreased $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. For both the three- and nine-month periods,\nthe increase in noninterest expenses was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits. The average number of employees increased to 49 for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in headcount is based on the addition of the Oak Leaf\nCommunity Mortgage team brought on during the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as additional hires during 2024 to supplement the lending team as operations continue to\nexpand. Additionally, the Company implemented the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan on June 15, 2023, and began recognizing expenses associated with this plan in June 2023,\nas such expenses were higher for the periods ended 2024 compared to 2023. Marketing and advertising costs increased during 2024 as a result of an increased focus on\nlending operations and related marketing to our new lending area, Will County, Illinois. Data processing expenses increased as we have continued to invest in systems and\nprocesses to improve the lending experience for our customers as well as implement efficiencies within our internal processes. Additionally, certain data processing\nexpenses are based on per employee costs, which increased due to an increase in headcount. Loan expenses increased as a result of an increase in loan originations during\nthe periods. Equipment and occupancy costs increased as a result of two additional loan production office rental agreements in place during 2024 that were not in place\nduring the first nine months of 2023. Management intends to continue to invest in the people and processes in place to achieve efficiencies as loan production continues to\ngrow.\nProvision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit). There was no provision for income tax expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nManagement estimates a taxable net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to non-taxable income, such as income on tax exempt municipal securities and BOLI.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income\nwill be generated to permit use of the existing net operating losses. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over\nthe three-year period ended September 30, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, management maintained the full valuation allowance against the federal net operating losses and net deferred tax\nassets to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however,\ncould be adjusted.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCOMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DECEMBER 31, 2023\nAt September 30, At December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSelected Consolidated Financial Condition Data:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,592 $ 31,388\nSecurities available for sale 75,240 82,135\nFHLB stock 585 550\nLoans held for sale 3,120 380\nLoans, net 133,811 120,623\nTotal assets 268,439 256,776\nTotal deposits 179,887 168,826\nTotal equity $ 78,436 $ 77,545\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $11.7 million to $268.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven\nby an increase in loans, net, funded by an increase in time deposits and a reduction in securities available for sale due to maturities and principal payments of securities.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $3.2 million to $34.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from $31.4 million at December 31, 2023. The\nincrease in cash was driven by an increase in time deposits during the same period and principal payments received on securities available for sale. Currently, the Bank\nholds a majority of the cash on hand at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, earning 4.90%, to keep the funds available for increasing loan demand. Management\ncontinues to actively monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis and maintain levels of liquid assets deemed adequate.\nTime deposits with other financial institutions. Time deposits with other financial institutions decreased $500,000 to $1.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from $2.0\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in time deposits with other financial institutions was driven by maturities during the year to date. Management has been\nreinvesting the matured funds into lending activities, increasing the average yield on assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.16% compared to 3.19% for\nthe same period ending September 30, 2023.\nSecurities Available for Sale. Securities available-for-sale decreased to $75.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $82.1 million at December 31, 2023. There\nwere no purchases or sales of securities available-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank\nreceived principal payments of $4.2 million, had maturities of $4.3 million, had net premium amortization and discount accretion of $393,000 and had a decrease in the\nunrealized loss on the portfolio of $2.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the securities available for sale portfolio included an unrealized loss position of $9.6 million, or 11.3% of the total book value of the portfolio.\nManagement monitors the portfolio for credit losses and believes that the decline in value does not presently represent realized losses and is due to market volatility and\nincreased market interest rates. While the Bank does not currently intend to sell securities in a loss position, management may consider the opportunity to reposition the\ninvestment securities portfolio in the future.\nLoans held for sale. Our loans held for sale increased $2.7 million to $3.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $380,000 at December 31, 2023. With the addition\nof Oak Leaf Community Mortgage during the late third and early fourth quarters of 2023, and the related increase in loan originations, management has increased the\nproportion of loan originations held for sale to the secondary market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank originated $33.6 million in loans held for\nsale.\nLoans, net. Our loans, net, increased by $13.2 million to $133.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $120.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank originated\n$38.6 million in loans to be held in the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had loan principal payments and payoffs of $22.8 million. The Bank\ncontinues to focus lending efforts on one- to four-family residential properties, which has seen the largest increase in balances during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. Additionally, the balance of construction loans has decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, however, the current available balance on construction\nloans is $3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and is expected to be drawn upon within the next 12 months. In an effort to continue to grow loan originations, the Bank\nhired three additional mortgage loan originators during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank sold $2.5 million in loans that were originally held in the\nportfolio to local community banks.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) which includes the allowance for credit losses on loans, and the allowance for credit losses on off-\nbalance sheet exposures (recorded in Other Liabilities), totaled $1.3 million, an increase of $95,000 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL is driven by\nan increase in the portfolio loan balances. As of September 30, 2024, there were no loans individually assessed and no loans were rated substandard or watch. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Bank has no non-accrual loans and two loan past due greater than 30 days. The Bank actively monitors the loan portfolio for signs of weakening\ncredit quality, noting as of September 30, 2024 the portfolio remains of high quality with limited credit concerns. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of unfunded\ncommitments increased as a result of an increase in the HELOCs and construction loans originated during the first nine months of 2024 and not yet drawn upon as well as in\nloans committed for origination.\n34\nTable of Contents\nDeposits. Total deposits increased $11.1 million to $179.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $168.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits is\nprimarily within the time deposit accounts as the Bank continued to offer a competitive CD special during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on current\noffering rates in our market area and our current deposit pricing strategy, as well as our strong historical deposit retention, management anticipates that a significant portion\nof maturing time deposits will be retained. Management continues to actively monitor the deposit balances and interest rates offered to maintain an adequate level of\nliquidity.\nAdditionally, management notes the percentage of time deposit accounts greater than $250,000 as a percentage of total time deposits has increased to 20.4% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The total balance of deposit accounts greater than $250,000 as of September 30, 2024 is $40.0 million, or 22.2% of\ntotal deposits. This represents an increase from December 31, 2023 of $34.3 million, or 20.3% of total deposits. Management works closely with depositors to reduce the\nuninsured balances through beneficiaries as well as to ensure depositors understand the risks.\nTotal Equity. Total equity increased $891,000 to $78.4 million at September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized loss position on the\nsecurities available-for-sale portfolio. The decrease in the unrealized loss position of $1.4 million, net of the related tax effect, is due to changes in market interest rates.\nAdditionally, the Bank began repurchasing treasury stock during the second quarter 2024, resulting in an additional $411,000 of treasury stock as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to December 31, 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAsset Quality\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our nonperforming assets. The decrease in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30,\n2024 was the result of payoffs or payment requirements met bringing the loans off of non-accrual as of September 30, 2024.\nAt September 30, At December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans $ — $ 200\nLoans 90+ days past due and accruing 264 —\nTotal non-performing loans 264 200\nOther real estate owned, net — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 264 $ 200\nAsset Quality Ratios: (1)\nNon-accrual loans as a percent of total loans outstanding —% 0.17%\nNon-performing assets as a percent of total assets 0.10% 0.08%\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of total loans outstanding 0.95% 0.97%\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of non-performing loans(2) 481.44% 588.00%\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans receivable —% —%\n(1) Asset quality ratios and capital ratios are end of period ratios, except for net charge-offs to average loans receivable.\n(2) Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans and loans that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans as of September 30, 2024 was 0.95%.

We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund\nloan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and\ndeposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments\non loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Chicago and a $10.0 million unsecured Fed Funds\nline of credit with BMO Harris Bank. At September 30, 2024, we had one outstanding advance from the FHLB of Chicago totaling $5.0 million and had the capacity to\nborrow approximately $78.1 million additional from the FHLB of Chicago. Additionally, we had no outstanding balance under our $10.0 million federal funds line of credit\nwith BMO Harris Bank.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by\ngeneral interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our\noperating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by\noperating activities was $74,000 and $363,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities,\nwhich consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and net change in investment securities, was $(7.0) million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increase in cash used in 2024 driven by the increase in the portfolio loans. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities,\nconsisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts was $10.2 million and $(10.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet\nour current funding commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024, totaled $54.0 million. Based on our deposit\nretention experience and current pricing strategy we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these\ndeposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB of Chicago advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest\nexpense.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nBank elected to begin using the CBLR. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such\ninstitution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 9%, subject to\na limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and\nreport risk-based capital ratios. North Shore Trust and Savings’ Tier 1 capital to Average Assets was 23.96% and 24.72% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had $2.5 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Our total letters and lines of credit and\nunused lines of credit totaled $8.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nCommitments. The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of\ncredit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at September 30, 2024.\nTotal Amounts\nCommitted at Amount of Commitment Expiration – Per Period\nSeptember 30,\n2024 To 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years\n(Dollars in thousands)\nUnused line of credit $ 8,242 $ 305 $ 693 $ 956 $ 6,288\nCommitments to originate loans 2,506 2,506 — — —\nTotal commitments $ 10,748 $ 2,811 $ 693 $ 956 $ 6,288\nContractual Cash Obligations.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a\ngreater impact on our performance than inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards”\n(ASU 2024-01). ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards\nshould be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or\nconsolidated statements of income.\nITEM 3.
