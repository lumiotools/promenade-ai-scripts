          "content": "BRENMILLER ENERGY LTD.\nCORPORATE POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING\nEFFECTIVE AS OF August 29, 2024\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis policy determines acceptable transactions in the securities of Brenmiller Energy Ltd.\n(the “Company”) by our employees, directors and consultants including employees of our\nsubsidiaries1. This policy arises from the Company’s status as a public company whose shares are\ntraded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BNRG”. During the course of your\nemployment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, you may receive important\ninformation that is not yet publicly available (“inside information”), about the Company or about\nother publicly-traded companies with which the Company has business dealings. Because of your\naccess to this inside information, you may be in a position to profit financially by buying or selling,\nor in some other way dealing, in the Company’s securities, or securities of another publicly-traded\ncompany, or to disclose such information to a third party who does so profit or which you may\nhave reasonable belief to assume will use the inside information (a “tippee”)2.\nIt should be noted that under the Israeli Securities Law, in the event an inside information\nis known to the Company, the prohibition to use such inside information applies to all the insiders\nof the Company regardless if they are not aware of the inside information.\nIn addition, the prohibition of use of inside information applies to the repurchase of the\nCompany’s securities by the Company. The company will be considered as having access to or\npossessing inside information, in the event a director or an employee of the company has access to\nor the inside information is in his possession.\nIf any provision of this policy contradicts the provisions of securities laws and regulations\napplicable to the Company, then the provisions of such securities laws and regulations shall prevail.\nII. INSIDER TRADING POLICY\nA. Securities Transactions\nUse of inside information by someone for personal gain, or to pass on, or “tip,” the inside\ninformation to someone who uses it for personal gain, is illegal, regardless of the quantity of shares,\nand is therefore prohibited. You can be held liable both for your own transactions and for\ntransactions effected by a tippee, or even a tippee of a tippee. Furthermore, it is important that the\nappearance of insider trading in securities be avoided. The only exception is that transactions\ndirectly with the Company, e.g., option exercises for cash or purchases under an employee share\n___________________________\n1.\nUnder the Israeli Securities Law, an insider also includes a principal shareholder of the company (i.e., a shareholder who holds\n5% or more of the issued share capital or of the voting power, or who can appoint one or more directors of the company).\n2.\nUnder the Israeli Securities Law, the use of inside information also relates to a person who delivers inside information or an\nopinion on the security of a company or on some other security for which the security of the company is an underlying asset\nwhile inside information is in his possession to any person who – he knows or has reasonable grounds to believe – will make\nuse of the inside information or will utilize the opinion for purposes of a transaction or will pass it on to another.\n1\npurchase plan, are permitted. However, the subsequent sale (including the sale of shares in a cashless\nexercise program) or other disposition of such shares is fully subject to these restrictions.\nB. Inside Information\nAs a practical matter, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether you possess inside\ninformation. The key to determining whether nonpublic information you possess about a public\ncompany is inside information is whether dissemination of the information would likely affect the\nmarket price of the company’s shares or would likely be considered important, or “material,” by\ninvestors who are considering trading in that company’s shares.\nRemember, both positive and negative information can be material. If you possess inside\ninformation, you may not trade in a company’s shares, advise anyone else to do so or communicate\nthe information to anyone else until you know that the information has been publicly disseminated.\nThis means that in some circumstances, you may have to forego a proposed transaction in a company’s\nsecurities even if you planned to execute the transaction prior to learning of the inside information\nand even though you believe you may suffer an economic loss or sacrifice an anticipated profit by\nwaiting.\n“Trading” includes engaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging\ntransactions and other inherently speculative transactions, for your own account or for others.\nAlthough by no means an all-inclusive list, information regarding the following subjects is\nreasonably likely to be found as material inside information until it is publicly disseminated:\n• financial results or forecasts, changes in earnings estimates or unusual gains or\nlosses in major operations;\n• major contract awards or cancellations, or corporate partner relationships or joint\nventure developments (including gain or loss of a significant commercial agreement or other\ncontracts with customers or suppliers, pricing changes or discount policies);\n• confirming or updating previous disclosures or analysts’ reports;\n• major product or technological developments;\n• M&A activity, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or pending public or\nprivate sales of debt or equity securities\n• declaration of share splits, dividends or changes in dividend policy;\n• possible tender offers or proxy fights;\n• significant write-offs;\n• significant litigation or settlements or any government agency investigations;\n• impending bankruptcy;\n• liquidity problems and extraordinary borrowings;\n2\n• changes in dividends, changes in debt ratings; and\n• changes in the Company’s management or the board of directors,\nsignificant changes in the Company’s prospects.\nFor information to be considered publicly disseminated, it must be widely disclosed\nthrough a press release or filing pursuant to U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nGenerally speaking, information will be considered publicly disseminated after two full trading\ndays have elapsed since the date of public disclosure of the information. For example, if an\nannouncement of inside information of which you were aware was made prior to trading on\nWednesday, then you may execute a transaction in the Company’s securities on Friday.\nIII. TRADING BY DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES\nWe require directors, officers and other employees to do more than refrain from insider\ntrading. We require that they limit their transactions in the Company’s shares to defined time\nperiods following public dissemination of annual and semi-annual financial results and notify, and\nreceive approval from, the Chief Financial Officer prior to engaging in transactions in the\nCompany’s shares and observe other restrictions designed to minimize the risk of apparent or\nactual insider trading.\nIt should be noted that under the Israeli Securities Law, if a principal insider in a company\nbuys securities of the company in which he is a principal insider or other securities for which the\ncompany's securities are an underlying asset within three months after the day on which he sold\nsaid securities, or if he sells such securities within three months after the day on which he bought\nsaid securities, that shall be prima facie evidence that he made use of inside information that he\nhad, except if he proves that he had no inside information at the time of the sale or purchase or\nthat, under the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable that he had no inside information at that\ntime.\nA “principal insider in a company\" means under the Israeli Securities Law – (1) Director,\ngeneral manager, deputy general manager, assistant general manager, accountant, internal auditor\nand any person who performs the function of one of them under a different title, and also an\nindividual who is a principal shareholder of the company; (2) a relative of one of those enumerated\nin paragraph (1); (3) a body corporate controlled by one of those enumerated in paragraphs (1) and\n(2).\nA. Covered Insiders\nThe provisions outlined in this policy apply to all directors, officers and employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. Generally, any entities or family members of those individuals\nwhose trading activities are controlled or influenced by any of such persons should be considered\nto be subject to the same restrictions.\nB. Trading Window Period\nThe period beginning one week before the end of the annual or semi-annual period\nand ending two (2) trading days following the date of public disclosure of the financial results\nfor that period is a particularly sensitive period of time for transactions in the Company's\n3\nshares from the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws. This sensitivity is\ndue to the fact that directors, officers and certain other employees will, during that period,\noften possess material nonpublic information about the expected financial results for the\nperiod.\nGenerally, except as set forth in this paragraph B and in paragraphs C and D of this\npolicy, directors, officers and other employees may buy or sell securities of the Company only\nduring a “window period” that opens after two full trading days have elapsed after the public\ndissemination of the Company’s annual or interim,) financial results and closes on the last\ntrading day one week before the end of the annual or semi-annual period. This window period\nmay be closed early or may not open if, in the judgment of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer,\nthere exists undisclosed information that would make trades by members of the Company’s\ndirectors, officers or employees inappropriate. It is important to note that the fact that the window\nperiod has closed early or has not opened should be considered inside information. A director,\nofficer or other employee who believes that special circumstances require him or her to trade\noutside the window period should consult with the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Permission\nto trade outside the window period will be granted only where the circumstances are extenuating\nand there appears to be no significant risk that the trade may subsequently be questioned.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THESE TIMING GUIDELINES, IT IS ILLEGAL FOR ANY PERSON\nTO TRADE WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION,\nINCLUDING SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE PERSON IS AWARE OF INSIDER\nINFORMATION THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED BY THE\nCOMPANY.\nC. Exceptions to Window Period\n1. Option/Warrant Exercises. Other than as provided in paragraphs III.C.3 and\nIII.C.4 below, directors, officers and other employees may exercise options/warrants for cash\ngranted under the Company’s equity incentive plans without restriction to any particular period in\nlight of information then available to the public. However, the subsequent sale of the shares\n(including sales of shares in a cashless exercise) acquired upon the exercise of options/warrants is\nsubject to all provisions of this policy.\n2. 10b5-1 Automatic Trading Programs. In addition, purchases or sales of the\nCompany’s securities made pursuant to, and in compliance with, a written plan established by a\ndirector, officer or other employee that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the U.S.\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (a “Trading Plan”) may be\nmade without restriction to any particular period provided that (i) the Trading Plan was established\nin good faith, in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, at the time when such individual\nwas not in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company and the Company had\nnot imposed any trading blackout period, (ii) the Trading Plan was reviewed by the Company prior\nto establishment, solely to confirm compliance with this policy and the securities laws and (iii) the\nTrading Plan allows for the cancellation of a transaction and/or suspension of such Trading Plan\nupon notice and request by the Company to the individual if any proposed trade (a) fails to comply\nwith applicable laws (e.g., exceeding the number of shares that may be sold under Rule 144 under\nthe U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or (b) would create material adverse consequences for\nthe Company. The Company must be notified of the establishment of any such Trading Plan, any\namendments to such Trading Plan and the termination of such Trading Plan.\n4\n3. Financial statements. According to the Israeli Securities Authority, there is a\npresumption that any material information which is included in the Company’s financial\nstatements, prior to their distribution to the public, is considered as inside information. Therefore,\nthe Company’s management may define a ‘Blackout Period’ prior to the publication of the\nfinancial statements in which no transactions will be made in Company’s securities by directors,\nofficers and other employees.\n4. Former Employees. Former employees of the Company who have left the\nCompany and still own securities of the Company that have not been forfeited shall contact the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer to discuss trading outside the window period on a case-by-case\nbasis.\nD. Pre-Clearance and Advance Notice of Transactions\nIn addition to the requirements of paragraph B above, directors, officers and other\nemployees that the Clearing Officer (as defined below) deems to have routine access to material\nnon-public information may not engage in any transaction in the Company’s securities, including\nany purchase or sale in the open market, loan or other transfer of beneficial ownership without first\nobtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (the\n“Clearing Officer”), at least two business days in advance of the proposed transaction. The Clearing\nOfficer will then determine whether the transaction may proceed. Pre-cleared transactions not\ncompleted within five business days shall require new pre-clearance under the provisions of this\nparagraph. The Company may, at its discretion, shorten such period of time.\nAdvance notice of gifts or an intent to exercise an outstanding share option shall be given\nto the Clearing Officer. To the extent possible, advance notice of upcoming transactions to be\neffected pursuant to an established Trading Plan under Section III.C.2 above shall also be given to\nthe Clearing Officer.\nE. Prohibition of Speculative or Short-term Trading\nNo director, officer or other employee may engage in short sales, transactions in put or call\noptions, hedging transactions, margin accounts or other inherently speculative transactions with\nrespect to the Company’s shares at any time.\nF. Control Shares\nDirectors and officers should take care not to violate the restrictions on sales by control\npersons (Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended), and should file any notices\nof sale required by Rule 144. The practical effect of Rule 144 is that directors and officers who sell\nthe Company’s securities may be required to comply with a number of requirements including\nholding period, volume limitation, manner of sale and SEC filing requirements.\nIV. DURATION OF POLICY’S APPLICABILITY\nThis policy continues to apply to your transactions in the Company’s shares or in the\nCompany’s tradeable options or the securities of other publicly traded companies engaged in\nbusiness transactions with the Company even after your employment, directorship or consultancy\nwith the Company has terminated. If you are in possession of inside information when your\nrelationship with the Company concludes, you may not trade in the Company’s shares or in the\n5\nCompany’s tradeable options or the securities of any such other company until the information has\nbeen publicly disseminated or is no longer material.\nV. VIOLATIONS OF INSIDER TRADING LAWS\nPenalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe,\nboth for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors, and\nmay include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given the\nseverity of the potential penalties, compliance with this policy is mandatory. Anyone who effects\ntransactions in the Company’s securities or the securities of other public companies engaged in\nbusiness transactions with the Company (or provides information to enable others to do so) on the\nbasis of inside information is subject to both civil liability and criminal penalties, as well as\ndisciplinary action by the Company.\nA. Legal Penalties\nA person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company’s\nsecurities when he or she has material nonpublic information can be sentenced to a substantial jail\nterm and required to pay a criminal penalty of several times the amount of profits gained or losses\navoided. In addition, a person who tips others may also be liable for transactions by the tippees to\nwhom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information. Tippers can be subject to the same\npenalties and sanctions as the tippees and the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the\ntipper did not profit from the transaction.\nThe SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an\ninsider trading violation, “directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such\nviolation,” which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel.\nThese control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of $1 million or three times the\namount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no\nprofit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its management and supervisory\npersonnel as control persons.\nB. Company-Imposed Penalties.\nDirectors, officers or employees who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary\naction by the Company, including dismissal for cause. Any exceptions to the policy, if permitted,\nmay only be granted by the Clearing Officer and must be provided before any activity contrary to\nthe above requirements takes place.\nVI.

With revolutionary technology, a strong track record, and a growing portfolio of strategic partnerships, Brenmiller has positioned itself to capitalize. \n\nRecently, Brenmiller released its 2023-2024 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report, a potent testament to its commitment to net-zero industrial heat solutions and advancing clean energy worldwide. Serving markets across the U.S., EU, Latin America, Canada, and Israel, Brenmiller has built a global presence with technology and partnerships that put them on track to become an integral services provider to the clean energy revolution.\n\n**Unleashing the Power of Partnership with Entelios**\n\nBrenmiller's innovation is its bGen™ ZERO technology-an innovative approach and solution for industrial decarbonization. Designed to bring versatile, clean heat to energy-intensive industries like food processing and large-scale manufacturers, bGen™ ZERO is meeting market needs in ways few could have imagined even a decade ago. And it couldn't be arriving at a better time, as demand for TES surges alongside ESG mandates and global decarbonization policies.\n\nBrenmiller's CEO recently described demand for TES as \"the strongest\" he's seen in his 40-year career. A planned partnership with Germany's Entelios AG, one of the nation's leading energy management firms, only adds to its momentum. Once executed, it aligns Brenmiller with Germany's ambitious green energy transition goals and allows them to tap into Entelios's impressive 1 GW of energy management flexibility. For perspective, that's enough to power around 750,000 households-at the same time promoting grid optimization and clean energy management.\n\n**Revolutionizing Grid Stability and Clean Energy Access**\n\nAdditionally, from its capability to generate high-temperature heat from renewable power, Brenmiller's bGen™ ZERO technology enhances grid stability, balances energy supply, and delivers massive energy savings for industrial clients. Moreover, its TES technology enables clients to participate in grid-balancing markets, reducing energy expenses, capturing revenue from ancillary services, and responding to demand spikes. These advantages position Brenmiller to capture a significant share of Germany's growing TES market, forecasted to hit $2.9 billion by 2028.\n\nGermany's negative grid energy prices, meaning that companies like Brenmiller can get paid to provide excess energy to the grid, are expected to open additional revenue opportunities for Brenmiller. In other words, with bGen™ ZERO's flexible energy model, Brenmiller could provide valuable service to clients and even sell excess energy back to the grid-a true two-way advantage that few competitors can match.\n\n**The World's First TES Gigafactory**\n\nBrenmiller's momentum and ambitions are supported by its state-of-the-art gigafactory in Dimona, Israel, the world's first thermal battery gigafactory. Opened in 2023 with support from the European Union, this groundbreaking facility provides the scale needed to meet the demands of Brenmiller's growing project pipeline, which the company forecasts can generate **$440 million** in revenues over contract durations. More than just a factory, this fully automated facility achieves one-third energy savings at full capacity, producing scalable, efficient, and sustainable TES technology to meet clean energy needs worldwide.\n\nAs important, Brenmiller's bGen™ ZERO technology provides non-stop energy storage to industrial operations, extending equipment lifespan and supporting global goals for clean, affordable, and on-demand energy. Brenmiller's alignment with key UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also underscores Brenmiller's commitment to environmental progress and sustainable infrastructure.\n\n**Accolades that Speak for Themselves**\n\nBrenmiller's solutions have attracted the right kind of attention. In 2023, TIME magazine named its bGen™ system a Best Invention in the Green Energy category, affirming its unique impact on sustainable energy. Brenmiller has also been named an Innovation Champion at the European Investment Bank's AdVenture Debt Summit, was a finalist in BloombergNEF's BNEF Pioneers competition, and received multiple honors at the 2023 Energy Storage Awards. These recognitions not only highlight the power and potential of its technology; they validate the company's role as a TES sector thought leader. \n\nAs competitors scramble to reach the start line, it's important to note that Brenmiller is already in the race to deliver net-zero industrial heat and prove that clean energy can be a reality-not a distant goal. Through its powerful partnerships, groundbreaking technology, and unmatched vision, Brenmiller Energy is setting the bar high for TES innovation. And while Brenmiller, its partners, and clients benefit, the biggest winner can be the planet itself.\n\n[![Cannot view this image?

(“Brenmiller”, “Brenmiller Energy” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BNRG), a leading\nglobal provider of thermal energy storage (“TES”) solutions for industrial and utility markets, today reported financial results as of and for the six months\nended June 30, 2024, in addition to operational and recent business development updates.\nManagement Commentary\n“Our pioneering bGen™ thermal battery continues to support the growing and mostly unmet need for on-demand access to sustainable heat. We have\nbuilt an impressive project pipeline, potentially worth up to $500 million in value, and our team is working tirelessly, day in and day out, to move this\npipeline forward so that we can start delivering meaningful cost savings and emissions reductions for our customers as well as recurring revenues for our\ncompany and value for our shareholders,” said Brenmiller Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Avi Brenmiller, “Among the proposals in our\npipelines, several include negotiations with some of the world’s largest producers of consumer goods, including Fortune 500s. All of our potential\ncontracts are in geographic markets with robust manufacturing sectors and where established regulations make our technology feasible and cost-\ncompetitive—or cheaper—with fossil fuels.”\n“In an exciting new development, our team is exploring ways to expand our technology’s capabilities to deliver cold thermal energy storage (“CTES”) for\nartificial intelligence (“AI”) data centers. The rapid growth of AI computing and the funding-rich ecosystem around AI applications has created\ndownstream decarbonization and financial opportunities that we believe can be met using CTES. We anticipate minimal investment is needed to adapt\nour bGen™ thermal battery for data center applications.”\n“As we continue executing our current projects and increasing worldwide distribution through local partnerships, we expect our gigafactory to be fully\noperational by the end of 2024, with capacity to produce up-to 4 GWh of bGen™ systems annually. We are very optimistic about market demand for our\nbGen™ TES technology and our ability to deliver throughout the remainder of 2024 and into the future.”\nFirst Half 2024 and Recent Operational and Business Developments\nHaaS Recurring Revenue Projects to Deliver Customer Savings and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n● Brenmiller to build, own and operate a 30 MWh bGen™ ZERO system for one of Europe’s largest pet food manufacturers: On August\n19, 2024, Brenmiller entered a 12-year Heat as a Service (“HaaS”) agreement with Partner in Pet Food Hungaria KFT (“PPF”), one of Europe’s\nleading private label pet food producers. Brenmiller will deliver low-cost and low-carbon steam to PPF and be in a position to offer grid\nbalancing services to the local transmission system operator. This is the first project through which Brenmiller will generate revenues from both\nselling heat as a service and offering balancing services to the local grid. Brenmiller’s bGen™ ZERO will take priority over PPF’s existing fossil\nfuel boilers, lowering the pet food manufacturer’s energy costs and carbon footprint by reducing gas use at its Hungarian factory by 25-30%.\nPPF will purchase steam from Brenmiller at a fixed rate.\n● bGen™ ZERO installation moves into construction phase at Heineken-backed beverage manufacturing plant for project estimated to\nsave $7.5 million: Brenmiller will replace fossil fuel boilers with a 32 MWh bGen™ system at Tempo Beverages Ltd.’s (“Tempo”) beverage\nproduction plant in Netanya, Israel. Tempo will purchase steam from Brenmiller at a fixed rate through a HaaS contract. By eliminating the use\nof approximately 2,000 tons of heavy fuel each year, Brenmiller’s bGen™ is estimated to mitigate over 6,200 tons of carbon emissions annually\nand save Tempo an estimated $7.5 million over 15 years. Partially owned by Heineken International B.V., Tempo is one of Israel’s largest\nproducers and distributors of beverages for brands including Heineken and Pepsi. The bGen™ TES system for Tempo will charge using a\ncombination of roof-top solar and ultra-low-cost off-peak grid power. System assembly is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and\ncommissioned in May 2025.\n● $450,000 grant from Israel Innovation Authority propels $3.55 million agreement to supply clean electric heat to Wolfson Hospital:\nBrenmiller signed a 7-year definitive agreement to supply Israel’s Wolfson Hospital with electric heat. The project is valued at $3.55 million and\nBrenmiller will earn recurring revenues through a HaaS contract. A grant of approximately $450,000 from the Israel Innovation Authority is\nbeing used to help finance the project. Brenmiller’s bGen™ ZERO will replace Wolfson Hospital’s outdated diesel boilers, which are both\ncostly and polluting. According to the Israeli Ministry of Finance, Brenmiller’s bGen™ ZERO will potentially save Wolfson Hospital up to $1.3\nmillion in annual energy costs and reduce the hospital’s local carbon footprint by 3,900 tons per year.\n● Successfully handed over bGen™ system to the State University of New York (SUNY) at Purchase: Brenmiller completed all required\nsystem tests and operator training for its first U.S. bGen™ installation and handed the system over to SUNY Purchase. bGen™ is expected to\neliminate approximately 550 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions for SUNY annually.\n2\nLooking to Ramp Sales in North America Through Distribution Partnerships\n● U.S. distribution gets boost with 5-year $150 million sales milestone license agreement in the Northeast: Brenmiller signed an exclusive\ndistribution agreement with Rock Energy Storage (“RES”). RES will sell and distribute bGen™ TES systems in Connecticut, Maine,\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York. The definitive 5-year agreement includes cumulative projected sales\nmilestones exceeding $150 million.\n● MOU with Proactive Planet to advance potential $6 million worth of projects in Alberta, Canada: A non-binding Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (“MoU”) was signed between Brenmiller and Proactive Planet, a renewable energy solutions provider based in Calgary, to\ndistribute bGen™ TES systems to industrial companies and electric utilities in the province of Alberta, Canada. The agreement includes an\ninitial list of potential customers with projects valued at over $6 million and represents potentially 60 MWh of TES capacity.\nAwards\n● The European Investment Bank named Brenmiller an “Innovation Champion” at its EIB AdVenture Debt Summit.\n● Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF”) selected Brenmiller as a 2024 BNEF Pioneers Finalist for its innovative and commercial-ready\napproach to industrial decarbonization and ability to overcome key challenges on the path to achieving net zero.\nSummary of Financial Results\n● Balance Sheet: As of June 30, 2024, Brenmiller had cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits of $6.99 million, a net increase of $3.78\nmillion from $3.21 million on December 31, 2023. This is attributable primarily to fundraising during the six months ended June 30, 2024 of\napproximately $7.97 million in net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants and warrants. Total assets increased by\n31% as of June 30, 2024, to $13.92 million, primarily due to a $3.78 million increase in cash and cash equivalents following the equity\nfinancings completed during the period. Total liabilities decreased by 4% to $7.39 million, primarily driven by a $324,000 reduction in operating\nlease liabilities. Shareholders’ equity increased by 127% to $6.54 million, largely due to the equity financings completed during the period.\n● Income Statement: Operating loss narrowed for the six months ended June 30, 2024, to $5.38 million, compared to $5.42 million for the same\nperiod in 2023. Net loss narrowed by 70% to $1.58 million, down from $5.33 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by a $3.72\nmillion increase in financial income, mainly resulting from a fair value adjustment of warrants.\n● Cash Flow Statement: Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $3.86 million, which primarily reflects\na net loss of $1.58 million and a non-cash adjustment of $2.46 million. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024 was $3.86 million compared to $366,000 in the prior year period.\n3\nSubsequent Events\nOn August 4, 2024, Brenmiller entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with an existing institutional shareholder for a private placement of\n1,000,000 ordinary shares, at a price of $1.05 per share, reflecting a 52% premium to the closing price for the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq on\nAugust 2, 2024. The closing of the private placement is subject to certain conditions, including the Company obtaining consent from an existing lender.\nThe investor will have the right to make a further investment for 1,000,000 additional ordinary shares (or ordinary share equivalents) in the event that the\nCompany’s ordinary shares close at or above $2.50 per share within the next 12 months.\nAbout bGen™\nbGen™, Brenmiller’s TES system, converts electricity into heat to power sustainable industrial processes at a price that is competitive with natural gas.\nThe bGen™ charges by capturing low-cost electricity from renewables or the grid and stores it in crushed rocks.

General description of the Company and its operations\nBrenmiller Energy Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated and commenced its business operations in Israel in 2012. The Company’s\nregistered offices are in Rosh Ha’Ayin in Israel. On May 25, 2022, the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) were listed and\nbegan trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On September 11, 2023, the Company’s voluntary delisting of its securities\nfrom the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”) took effect (the last trading day was September 7, 2023).\nThe Company is a technology company that develops, produces, markets and sells thermal energy storage (“TES”) systems based on our\nproprietary and patented bGen™ technology. The use of the Company’s technology allows electrification and decarbonization of the\nindustrial industry sector resulting in better integration with renewable energy sources and further reduction of carbon emissions. Through\n2022, the Company’s main activity was focused on the development of its technology and its application into products and commercial\nsolutions. In 2023, the Company commenced the commercialization of its products and services and is in the process of assembling a new\nproduction line to facilitate commercial operations which is planned to commence operation in the second half of 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries (in Israel, the Netherlands and the United States), that are currently\ninactive, or are in the early stages of operations (“the Group”).\nB. The impact of the regional war involving Israel\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel and launched thousands of rockets in a widespread terrorist attack on Israel.\nOn the same day, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war and the Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active\nduty, including a few of our employees. Our operations could be disrupted by these and future reserve duty call-ups. While none of our\nfacilities or infrastructure have been damaged since the war broke out on October 7, 2023, the import and export of goods may experience\ndisruptions in and out of Israel as a result of such military conflict and terrorist attacks on the sea routes in the Red Sea region. A prolonged\nwar could result in further military reserve duty call-ups in the future as well as irregularities to our supply chain and the movement of\ncomponents and raw material into Israel and our finished products exported from Israel. The Company operations, including its production\nfacility, are located in Israel. The war has slowed down the Company’s ability to fully operate the new production facility due to delays in\ndelivery of machinery and shortage in man-power caused by military reserve call-ups, in addition, the Company is required to find\nalternative sources of materials and supplies and to cope with increasing costs. A negative sentiment may also affect international markets\nthat may, in turn, affect the Company commercially and with regard to its ability to raise funds. Such disruption, including the escalation or\nexpansion to more areas of this war, could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of\noperations.,\nC. Liquidity\nThe Company has not yet generated significant revenues from its operations and has an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2024, as well as a\nhistory of net losses and negative operating cash flows. In 2023, the Company commenced the commercialization of its products and\nservices and is currently in the final stages of assembling its new production line that will facilitate the shift in operations from the\ndevelopment stage to commercial operations. However, the Company expects to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from\noperations until its products reach profitability.\nF-8\nBrenmiller Energy Ltd.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL (cont.):\nC. Liquidity (cont.)\nAs a result of these expected losses and negative cash flows from operations, along with the Company’s current cash position, the Company\nhas concluded that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed\nfinancial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments\nthat might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement’s plans include the continued commercialization of the Company’s products and services, raising capital through a private and\npublic offerings (including and using of ATM ) and the withdrawal of the second tranche of financing from EIB for the purpose of\nexpanding the production facility capacity and through government grants under approved research and development plans and approved\nprojects. In addition, management is planning to find additional cash sources through additional equity and debt financing (see also Note 8).\nThere are no assurances however, that the Company will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for its operations. If the\nCompany is unsuccessful in commercializing its products and raising capital, it may need to reduce, delay, or adjust its operating expenses,\nincluding commercialization of existing products or be unable to expand its operations, as desired.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nA. Basis of presentation:\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”)’s Regulation S-X. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are\nnormally required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( “U.S. GAAP”) can be condensed or omitted. These\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial\nposition as of and for the periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should\nbe read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of results that could be expected for the 2024 fiscal year or any other\ninterim period or for any other future year. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nB. Change in functional currency\nEffective January 1, 2024 the Company changed its functional currency to the U.S. dollar from the New Israel Shekel (“NIS”). Prior to this\nchange, the Group’s presentation currency used in its consolidated financial statements was the U.S. Dollar ($), while translation differences\nfrom NIS were carried to “Other Comprehensive Income or Loss”.\nThis change was based on the assessment by the Company’s management, that the dollar has become the primary economic environment in\nwhich the Company operates, after considering several factors and changes in circumstances in 2023 including inter alia: the\ncommercialization of the Company’s products, changes in the composition of its cost of sales, available funds are mainly denominated in\nU.S. dollars, and the fact that the Company’s principal source of financing, following the delisting of its shares from trading in TASE, is\nderived from the U.S. capital markets (Note 5A), and all of the Company’s budgeting is conducted mainly in U.S. dollars. The change in\nfunctional currency was accounted for prospectively.\nThe change in functional currency to the U.S. dollar resulted inter-alia in a reclassification of the Company’s certain equity-classified\nwarrants (whose fair value as of January 1, 2024 was $1,649 thousand), to liabilities due to their NIS-denominated exercise price. See also\nNote 5A, as to changes in the currency of exercise price made during the reporting period.\nF-9\nBrenmiller Energy Ltd.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.):\nC. Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements:\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. Estimates are primarily used for, but not limited to, valuation of share-based compensation, useful lives of property,\nplant and equipment and royalty liabilities. The Company’s management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used are\nreasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates, and such differences may have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nD. Concentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of trade and other receivables, and\ncash, cash equivalents and restricted deposits held at financial institutions.\nThe Company places its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted deposits in high credit quality financial institutions. In\ngeneral, customers are not required to provide collateral or any other security to support accounts receivable but are required to make\nadvances with the advancement of projects.\nCurrent expected credit loss expense is $289 thousand and $NIL. thousand, for the six month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nE. New Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740), effective for the Company for annual periods commencing on or after December 15, 2025, and\nASU 2023-07—Segment Reporting (Topic 280), effective annual periods commencing on or after December 15, 2023, and for interim\nperiods, on or after December 15, 2024, will require improvements to Income Tax and Reportable Segment disclosures. These are not\nexpected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as a result of their future adoption.\nNOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is based on the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements,\nthe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad\nlevels, which are described as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.\nThe carrying amount of the cash and cash equivalents, restricted deposits, trade receivable, trade payables, other receivable and EIB loan,\napproximates their fair value.\nAs of June 30, 2024, except for warrants liability of $11 thousand (Note 5A(1); level 2 in the hierarchy), and December 31, 2023, the company\nhas no financial instruments measured at fair value.\nF-10\nBrenmiller Energy Ltd.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4 - INVENTORY:\nComprised as follows (U.S. dollars in thousands):\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nWork in progress $ 565 $ 546\nRaw materials 60 61\n$ 625 $ 607\nNOTE 5 - EQUITY:\nA. Share capital and warrants\n1) On January 1, 2024, as a result of the change in the functional currency of the Company (Note 2B.) all outstanding warrants issued\nunder private placements on February 16, 2023 and June 15, 2023 that had exercise price denominated in NIS, could have not been\nconsidered anymore as indexed to the Company’s own shares, and therefore were reclassified from equity to liabilities at their fair value\nof $1,649 thousand (valued, as of that date, using the Black - Scholes pricing model).\nSubsequently, and after receiving the approval of the warrants holders (except for two individuals) to fix the exercise price of such\nwarrants in US Dollars terms (converted from NIS to US Dollars based on the exchange rate as of May 16, 2024), and after the\napproval of the Board of Directors of the Company, on May 23, 2024, all consented warrants were reclassified to equity at their present\nfair value of $219 thousand (valued at modification date under the Black - Scholes pricing model, under the following assumptions: risk\nfree interest rate 4.53%-4.71%, expected term 3.6-4 years, expected price volatility of 100%-103%, fair value of an ordinary share of\n$1.55 and 0% dividend yield); consequently, the Company recognized $1,419 thousand in financial income for the period, resulting\nfrom the change in fair value of the warrants’ liability. The remaining liability of $11 thousand is presented among long-term liabilities.\n2) On January 25, 2024, the Company closed a public offering under which it completed the issuance and sale of 240,000 Ordinary\nShares, no par value per share of the Company at a price of $4.50 per share, pre-funded warrants at a price of $4.4999, to purchase\n648,890 Ordinary Shares (which were all exercised into shares on May 17, 2024) and warrants to purchase 888,890 Ordinary Shares at\nan exercise price of $5.00 per share. The Warrants were exercisable immediately and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants were exercisable immediately at a price of $0.0001 per share and were exercisable until exercised in full.\nThe Ordinary Shares, Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants were offered and sold pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on\nForm F-1, as amended. The aggregate gross proceeds from this offering were approximately $4.0 million before deducting placement\nagent fees of $280 thousand and other fund-raising expenses, of $316 thousand.\nFollowing their issuance, the Company determined that some of the features of the warrants, did not meet the “indexed to Company’s\nown stock” criteria, and are therefore precluded from equity classification. Consequently, the gross proceeds received in the offering\nwere initially allocated to the warrant’s that were classified as a liability, based on their fair value, and the residual was allocated to the\nshares and the prefunded warrants. Upon issuance, the warrants were valued at $3,176 thousand using the Black-Scholes pricing model,\nunder the following assumptions: fair value of an ordinary share - $4.89, expected option term of 5 years, expected price volatility of\n93%, risk-free annual interest rate of 4.51% and dividend yield of 0%.\nF-11\nBrenmiller Energy Ltd.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5 - EQUITY (cont.):\nA. Share capital and warrants (cont.)\nIssuance costs were proportionally allocated to the issued financial instruments based on the proceed amounts allocated to such\ninstruments. Consequently, $473 thousand of issuance costs, that were allocated to the warrants, were carried directly to financial\nexpenses.\nThe features of these warrants were amended under an agreement with the holding investor which became effective on June 6, 2024.\nConsequently, the Company reclassified these warrants to equity at their fair value of $481 thousand (valued under the Black - Scholes\npricing model under the following assumptions: : risk free interest rate 4.3%, expected term 4.6 years, expected price volatility of\n100%, fair value of an ordinary share of $1.07 and 0% dividend yield) and recognized financial income from the change in their fair\nvalue of $2,695 thousand.\n3) On April 10, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register\nadditional 500,000 Ordinary Shares, in the aggregate, issued or reserved for issuance under the 2013 Option Plan.\n4) The following table presents the outstanding warrants, as of June 30, 2024 and their terms:\nNumber of Exercise price\noutstanding for one\nDate of issuance warrants Ordinary share Expiration date\nFebruary 16, 2023 181,575 $16.66 February 1, 2028\nFebruary 16, 2023 52,251(*) NIS 61.3 February 1, 2028\nJanuary 24, 2023 14,822(*) NIS 61.3 January 24, 2025\nJune 15, 2023 248,778 $12.0 June 12, 2028\nJanuary 25, 2024 888,890 $5.0 January 25, 2029\n(*) Presented as a warrants' liability in the balance sheet, see note A(1) above.\n5) During the first half of 2024, under the agreement with a A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the “Sales Agent”), the Company issued\n2,798,421 ordinary shares, for a total consideration of approximately $4.8 million; agent commissions and other issuance costs\namounted $260 thousand.\nB. Share-based payment:\nDuring the six month period ended June 30 2024, the Company granted 115,635 fully vested RS to service providers, valued $158 thousand\nand granted bonuses to employees and service providers, in share based payment valued under the Black - Scholes pricing model at $ 535\nthousand, which included 222,034 fully vested RS (which were formally issued subsequent to June 30, 2024), and 24,544 fully vested\noptions exercisable at $0.01 per share to 24,544 Shares (to service providers; valued at $53 thousand). An additional bonus valued at $89\nthousand is awaiting shareholder meeting approval (required under Israeli Law) and therefor was not yet recognized as an expense for the\nperiod.

Forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results\nas of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking\nstatements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking\nstatements.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results, developments, and business decisions to differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements include, among other things:\n● our planned level of revenues and capital expenditures;\n● our ability to market and sell our products;\n● our plans to continue to invest in research and development to develop technology for both existing and new products;\n● our ability to maintain our relationships with suppliers, manufacturers, and other partners;\n● our ability to maintain or protect the validity of our European, U.S., and other patents and other intellectual property;\n● our ability to retain key executive members;\n● our ability to internally develop and protect new inventions and intellectual property;\n● our ability to expose and educate the industry about the use of our products;\n● our expectations regarding our tax classifications;\n● our ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, the timing and effect thereof;\n● interpretations of current laws and the passages of future laws;\n● general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including those related to recent unrest and actual or\npotential armed conflict in Israel and other parts of the Middle East, such as the Israel’s multi-front war; and\n● those factors referred to in “Item 3.D. Risk Factors,” “Item 4. Information on the Company,” and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review\nand Prospects”, in our 2023 Annual Report.\nWe believe that our forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, these statements are only current predictions and are subject to known\nand unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to\nbe materially different from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. We describe many of these risks in greater detail under the heading\n“Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report.\nAll forward-looking statements contained in this Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K speak only as of the date of this document and\nare expressly qualified in their entirety as described herein and by the cautionary statements contained within the “Risk Factors” section of the 2023\nAnnual Report.

In evaluating forward-looking statements, you\nshould consider these risks and uncertainties and not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.\nThe terms “Brenmiller,” “Brenmiller Energy,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” and “the Company” in this Report of Foreign Private Issuer on\nForm 6-K refer to Brenmiller Energy Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries, consisting of Brenmiller Energy (Rotem) Ltd., Brenmiller Energy Inc. and\nBrenmiller Energy NL B.V., unless the context otherwise requires.\nOverview\nWe are a technology company that develops, produces, markets, and sells thermal energy storage, or TES, systems based on our proprietary and\npatented bGen™ technology. Our bGen™ technology uses crushed rocks to store heat at high temperatures and our TES systems use that heat to dispatch\nconsistent thermal energy on demand.\nRecent Developments\nDimona Israel Production Facility\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have received the majority of the equipment for the Dimona facility build-out. The production facility is planned to be\nIndustry 4.0 compliant and will have a fully automated production line with a production capacity of up to 4 GWh of the bCube™ incorporated in the\nCompany’s patented bGen TES modules annually. We expect that the Dimona facility will be fully operational by the end of 2024 and plan to ramp-up\nthe production line and increase its production capacity in order to reach its full production capacity target of 4 GWh annually. The equipment purchase\norder was financed through a non-dilutive credit facility agreement with The European Investment Bank, or EIB. On July 8, 2024, we signed an\namendment to the credit facility agreement, or the Amendment, with the EIB. The initial credit facility agreement dated March 31, 2021, or the EIB\nAgreement, included funding limited to a total sum of €7.5 million. The funding was granted in a co-funding track, where EIB allowed withdrawals of\nsums equal to capital investments in the Company available in two tranches. On July 28, 2022, the first tranche of €4 million was drawn down by the\nCompany with a 5.0% fixed annual interest rate. Interest payments are due annually on July 28 of each year and the principal shall be repaid in equal\nannual payments starting from July 28, 2026 and maturing on July 28, 2028. Following the Amendment, the second tranche of €3.5 million is available\nwithin 48 months instead of 36 months of signing the EIB Agreement, or March 31, 2025, subject to certain conditions, with a 5.0% fixed annual interest\nrate.\n2\nJanuary 2024 Equity Financing\nOn January 22, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a U.S. based institutional investor for the sale of 240,000 Ordinary\nShares, warrants to purchase up to 888,890 Ordinary Shares, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 648,890 Ordinary Shares, at a price of $4.50 per\nOrdinary Share and accompanying warrant, less $0.0001 per pre-funded warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million before\ndeducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, or the January 2024 Offering. After deducting costs associated with the offering, our net\nproceeds were $3.4 million. The warrants are exercisable immediately at a price of $5.00 per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe pre-funded warrants were exercisable immediately at a price of $0.0001 per share and were exercisable until exercised in full. The offering closed on\nJanuary 25, 2024. The pre-funded warrants were exercised in full on May 17, 2024.\nCommercial Opportunities\nOn May 17, 2024 we reported substantial growth in our pipeline of commercial opportunities. As of May 1, 2024, we had a pipeline of\ncommercial opportunities of 49 potential contracts in various stages of development for our bGen™ ZERO TES systems valued in the vicinity of $500\nmillion and representing more than 6,000 MWh of zero-emission heat. We are advancing potential projects in 12 industries. Food and beverage,\nconsumer goods, energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals represent the largest share across 13 countries including the U.S., Spain, Hungary, Israel, and\nIndia. Approximately two-thirds of the commercial opportunities are equipment sales and one-third will be delivered through an Energy-as-a-Service or\nHeat-as-a-Service model. Nearly all of our commercial opportunities have the ability to utilize renewable electricity into the process of heat.\nRock Energy Storage LLC Distribution Agreement\nOn June 3, 2024, we entered into a license distribution agreement with Rock Energy Storage LLC, or RES, to sell and distribute our bGen™\nTES systems in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and New York. The definitive 5-year agreement includes\ncumulative projected sales milestones exceeding $150 million. Cogeneration Contractors Inc. dba RSP Systems, or RSP Systems, will act as RES’s lead\nsubcontractor. We had previously announced on January 11, 2024 we had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with RSP Systems; the Agreement\nwith RES supersedes the previous Memorandum of Understanding with RSP Systems.\nAll rights, title and/or interest in any intellectual property associated with bGen™ TES systems, including, but not limited to, any copyrights,\npatents, trademarks, knowhow, trade secrets and goodwill associated with the bGen™ TES systems, as well as any and/or derivatives and/or applications\nthereof will remain our sole property.\nThe agreement also contains customary provisions including representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification of us by RES and\nindemnification of RES by us.\nProactive Planet Memorandum of Understanding\nOn June 12, 2024 we announced that we signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding, or MoU, with Proactive Planet, a renewable\nenergy solutions provider based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to distribute bGen™ TES systems to industrial companies and electric utilities in the\nprovince of Alberta in Canada. We and Proactive Planet have developed an initial list of potential customers valued at over $6 million and representing\npotentially 60 megawatt hours (MWh) of TES capacity. The MoU aims to expand and accelerate the rollout of our bGen™ TES technology through\nequipment sales. Under its terms, a prospective 3-year definitive agreement would include projected sales milestones based on the companies’ pipeline.\nbGen™ Cool\nOn July 18, 2024 we announced that we will expand our proprietary technology’s capabilities and develop a Cold Thermal Energy Storage, or\nCTES, solution for data center applications, called the bGen™ Cool. We will continue bGen™ production for power-to-heat applications in service of our\ncurrent commercial opportunities, valued at up to $500 million in potential sales. Leveraging the bGen™’s core competencies, we expect minimal\ninvestment is needed to adapt our existing proprietary TES technology to meet data center demand.\n3\nAugust 2024 Private Placement\nOn August 4, 2024, we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”) for a private placement of\n1,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of $1.05 per share. The closing of the private placement is subject to certain conditions, including us obtaining\nconsent from an existing lender within 90 days of signing the securities purchase agreement. Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, Alpha\nwill also have the right to make a further investment for 1,000,000 additional Ordinary Shares (or ordinary share equivalents) in the event that our\nOrdinary Shares close at or above $2.50 per share within the next 12 months. The securities purchase agreement provides for registration rights for the\nOrdinary Shares and we have agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the Ordinary Shares within thirty (30) days of\nclosing. The private placement is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $1.05 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the private\nplacement for general corporate purposes, including working capital. In connection with the private placement, we announced that we do not plan to use\nour “at-the-market” facility to sell our Ordinary Shares into the market for at least as long as our shares are trading below $2.00 per share.\nBoard of Director Changes\nOn August 5, 2024, we announced the appointment of Messrs. Zvi Joseph and Miki Korner to our Board of Directors (the “Board”) effective on\nAugust 14, 2024, filling vacancies to be created as a result of the resignations of two current directors as will be later determined by the Board. On\nAugust 13, 2024, we received notices from Mr. Boaz Toshav and Mr. Ziv Dekel which stated their resignation as members of the Board, effective August\n14, 2024. The resignations of Mr. Boaz Toshav and Mr. Ziv Dekel were not due to any disagreements with the Company, management, the Board or any\ncommittee thereof or with respect to any matter regarding the Company’s operations, policies or practices.\nOperational Update\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, our primary activity was focused on the development of our technology and its application into\nproducts and commercial solutions and continuing the assembly of our new production line.\nWe are currently in the process of installing projects in various geographic regions in an effort to demonstrate the use of its technologies for both\nindustrial and utility scale applications, which are ultimately expected to support the commercialization of the technology. Our projects are progressing as\nplanned and are expected to reach major milestones over the next twelve months. Key updates to its projects include:\n● Tempo’s Beverage Manufacturing Plant: On June 10, 2024 we announced that we have moved into the construction phase of development\nat Tempo Beverages Ltd.’s, or Tempo, beverage production plant in Netanya, Israel, with plans to begin on-site assembly by the end of\nSeptember 2024. We are replacing Tempo’s fossil fuel boilers with a 32 MWh bGen™ TES system and will deliver sustainable process heat\nthrough an Energy as a Service (EaaS) model. Tempo is partially owned by Heineken International B.V. and is one of Israel’s largest\nproducers and distributors of beverages for brands including Heineken and Pepsi. Our bGen™ TES system for Tempo will charge using a\ncombination of roof-top solar and ultra-low-cost off-peak grid power. The system is being configured to meet the beverage manufacturer’s\nprecise operational needs and the final system design is expected to be completed by the end of July 2024. We have started procuring the\nnecessary components to manufacture Tempo’s bGen™ system and all system manufacturing will be completed at our TES gigafactory in\nDimona, Israel. System assembly is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and commissioned in May 2025.\n● SUNY Purchase:On February 6, 2024 we announced that we had completed all required system tests and operator training and has handed\nover our first bGen™ installation in the SUNY campus. The bGen™ storage system installation at a SUNY college charges by using both\nexhaust gas and electricity and discharges heat on demand. Our bGen™ is expected to eliminate approximately 550 metric tons of\ngreenhouse gas emissions for SUNY annually. Developed and deployed in partnership with the New York Power Authority, the largest state\npower organization in the U.S., the project was financed in part by a grant from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and\nDevelopment (BIRD) Foundation.\n4\n● Wolfson Medical Center: On January 29, 2024, an agreement was signed with the Wolfson Medical Center, or Wolfson Hospital, in the city\nof Holon, Israel for the construction of a TES System pursuant to which we will build and install on the Wolfson Hospital premises a TES\nSystem that will provide industrial steam and other services to the Wolfson Hospital (including training and certification of the Wolfson\nHospital related staff that will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the TES System. The TES System will operate using\nelectricity and water supplied by the Wolfson Hospital and will provide the Services for a period of seven years, commencing no later than\n15 months after obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and allowing for a two-month running-in period. The operation of the TES\nSystem, and the required maintenance thereafter will be our responsibility including efficiency ratio of the TES System during the service\nperiod that will be examined annually; subject to a contractual remedy period, any failure to meet the efficiency ratio may give Wolfson\nHospital cause to terminate the agreement and claim compensation as determined in the agreement. In consideration for the services,\nWolfson Hospital will pay a total of approximately NIS 12 million (approximately – $3.2 million), in non-equal monthly payments and will\nhave the option to acquire the TES System after the conclusion of the 7 year service period for an agreed amount equal to NIS 1.02 million\n(approximately - $ 0.3 million), and following which the Hospital will also have the option to acquire annual maintenance services\n(including spare parts) from us. If the option to acquire is not exercised, then we will be responsible to dismantle and vacate the TES System\nfrom the Wolfson Hospital premises. On January 18, 2024, we received approval for approximately $450,000 grant from the Israeli\nInnovation Authority, or the IIA, to be applied to this project.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the periods presented.\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\nUS dollars in thousands, except per share data (unaudited) 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nEngineering services - 580\n$ - $ 580\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues (408) (1,193)\nResearch and development, net (1,808) (1,711)\nSelling and marketing (616) (687)\nGeneral and administrative (2,313) (2,409)\nOther income (expenses), net (230) 2\nOperating loss (5,375) (5,418)\nInterest expenses (85) (69)\nOther financial income, net 3,879 159\nFinancial income, net 3,794 90\nNet loss $ (1,581) (5,328)\nNet loss per ordinary share:\nBasic and diluted loss $ (0.45) $ (3.02)\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per share 3,510,328 1,765,142\n5\nComparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $NIL compared to $580 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The decrease was primarily attributable to the $109 thousand reduction in payroll and related expenses, partially offset\nby an increase of $57 thousand in other expenses.\nWe expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to enhance our market penetration efforts mainly by partnering\nwith local agents in our target markets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by 4% to $2,313 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $2,409 thousand\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $388 thousand reduction in payroll and related costs and a decrease\nof $42 thousand in depreciation and general administrative expenses. This decrease was offset by an increase of $289 thousand in allowances for credit\nlosses and an increase $42 thousand in payments to consultants and insurance expenses.\nOther Income (expenses), net\nOther net expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $230 thousand, which was primarily attributable to a write off the remaining\nasset from the closure of the Rotem 1 project, compared to other net income of $2 thousand for six months ended June 30, 2023.\nOperating Loss\nBased on the foregoing, our operating loss decreased from $5,418 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $5,375 thousand for six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024.\nFinancial Income, Net\nThe net financial income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $3,794 thousand, compared to net financial income of $90 thousand for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023.

This decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in financial income, net as described above.\n7\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nSince our inception through June 30, 2024, we have funded our operations principally from receipt $115.6 million in proceeds from the issuance\nof our ordinary shares, options, convertible securities, loans and governmental grants. As of June 30, 2024, we had $6,999 thousand in cash and cash\nequivalents and restricted deposits.\nThe table below presents our cash flows for the periods indicated.\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\nUS dollars in thousands (unaudited) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (3,864) $ (3,580)\nNet cash used in investing activities (247) (2,092)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 7,974 6,038\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits $ 3,863 $ 366\nOperating Activities\nSince our incorporation, we have had ongoing losses and incurred negative cash flows from operating activities. For example, in the six months\nended June 30, 2024, we had operating losses of $5,375 thousand. We have mainly financed our activities in the six months ended June 30, 2024 through\nthe issuance of our Ordinary Shares and warrants, and governmental grants. Management plans to continue to commercialize our products and services\nand secure sufficient financing through additional equity or debt financing and obtaining additional governmental grants. There are no assurances\nhowever, that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our operations or that such financing will be available on terms\nacceptable to us.\nCash flows from operating activities consist primarily of adjustments to net loss for various non-cash items, including depreciation, fair value\nadjustment of warrants’ liability, warrants issuance costs, loss from the write off the remaining asset from the closure of the Rotem 1 project, share-based\ncompensation expenses, and non-cash interest and exchange rate differences, net. In addition, cash flows from operating activities are impacted by\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities, which include inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, and other assets and accounts payable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $3,864 thousand. This net cash used in operating activities\nprimarily reflects a net loss of $1,581 thousand, and a non-cash adjustment of $2,462 thousand, a decrease of $187 thousand in prepaid expenses and\nreceivables, an increase in other payables and deferred revenue of $159 thousand, offset by an increase of $18 thousand in inventory and a decrease in\ntrade payables of $149 thousand. Net non-cash adjustment of $2,462 thousand consisted primarily of fair value adjustment of warrant liability of $4,114\nthousand, warrants issuance costs of $473 thousand, loss from the write off the remaining asset from the closure of the Rotem 1 project of $233 thousand,\na share-based compensation payment of $915 thousand, a depreciation of $56 thousand and non-cash interest and exchange rate differences, net of $25\nthousand.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $3,580 thousand.

This net cash used in investing activities is\nattributable primarily to capital expenditure of $251 thousand mainly for the production facility in Dimona.\nNet cash used for investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $2,092 thousand. This net cash used in investing activities is\nattributable primarily to capital expenditure of $2,097 thousand mainly for the production facility in Dimona.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $7,974 thousand. This net cash is attributable to proceeds\nfrom the issuance of Ordinary Shares, pre-funded warrants and warrants of $8,827 thousand and the exercise of options and warrants amounting to a total\nof $3 thousand, offset by a fund raising and issuance costs of $856 thousand.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the six-month ended June 30, 2023 was $6,038 thousand. This net cash is attributable to the\nproceeds from issuance of ordinary shares and pre-funded warrants of $6,087 thousand, offset by a fund raising and issuance costs of $49 thousand.\nCurrent Outlook\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from the issuance of our ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants and warrants,\nrevenues from the sale of products, and revenues from licensing fees, and engineering services, a loan from EIB and governmental grants. We have\nincurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2012.\nWe expect to generate revenues from the sale of our products, heat as a service operations and other revenues in the future. However, we do not\nexpect these revenues to support all of our operations in the near future. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our activities, particularly\nas we continue the development of our products, and continue our commercialization efforts. Accordingly, we expect that we will require substantial\nadditional funding in connection with the growth of our operations, continuing our research and development activity, commercializing our products and\nto proceed with projects that partly will have to be financed by us in order to penetrate relevant markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits shown in the statement of cash flows were $6,999 thousand.\nOn June 9, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, or the Sales Agent, pursuant to which it may offer\nand sell, from time to time, to or through the Sales Agent as agent or principal Ordinary Shares in an “at-the-market” offering, as defined in Rule 415(a)\n(4) promulgated under the Securities Act, for an aggregate offering price of up to $9.35 million. We will pay the Sales Agent a commission equal to 3.0%\nof the gross sales price per share sold pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement. We are not obligated to sell any Ordinary Shares under the Sales\nAgreement and no assurance can be given that we will sell any Ordinary Shares under such agreement, or, if we do, as to the price or number of such\nshares that we will sell or the dates on which any such sales will take place. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, 2,798,421 Ordinary Shares were\nsold under the Sales Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,827 thousand.\n9\nOn January 22, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a U.S. based institutional investor for the sale of 240,000 Ordinary\nShares, warrants to purchase up to 888,890 Ordinary Shares, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 648,890 Ordinary Shares, at a price of $4.50 per\nOrdinary Share and accompanying warrant, less $0.0001 per pre-funded warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million before\ndeducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, or the January 2024 Offering. After deducting costs associated with the offering, our net\nproceeds were $3.4 million. The warrants are exercisable immediately at a price of $5.00 per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe pre-funded warrants are exercisable immediately at a price of $0.0001 per share and are exercisable until exercised in full. The offering closed on\nJanuary 25, 2024. On May 17, 2024 the pre-funded warrants were fully exercised.\nOn January 22, 2024, we entered into a placement agency agreement, or the Placement Agency Agreement, with A.G.P./Alliance Global\nPartners, or the Placement Agent, pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to serve as placement agent for the issuance and sale of Ordinary\nShares, warrants and pre-funded warrants. We agreed to pay the Placement Agent an aggregate cash fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds received by\nfrom the sale of the securities in this offering, however in the case of certain identified investors we agreed to pay a cash fee equal to 3.5% of the gross\nproceeds received by us from such investors. Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, we also agreed to pay the Placement Agents $105,000 for\naccountable expenses and $25,000 for non-accountable expenses. The Placement Agency Agreement has indemnification and other customary provisions\nfor transactions of this nature.\nOn August 4, 2024, we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with Alpha for a private placement of 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares\nat a price of $1.05 per share. The closing of the private placement is subject to certain conditions, including us obtaining consent from an existing lender\nwithin 90 days of signing the securities purchase agreement. Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, Alpha will also have the right to make\na further investment for 1,000,000 additional Ordinary Shares (or ordinary share equivalents) in the event that our Ordinary Shares close at or above\n$2.50 per share within the next 12 months. The securities purchase agreement provides for registration rights for the Ordinary Shares and we have agreed\nto file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the resale of the Ordinary Shares within thirty (30) days of\nclosing. The private placement is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $1.05 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the private\nplacement for general corporate purposes, including working capital. In connection with the private placement, we announced that we do not plan to use\nour “at-the-market” facility to sell our Ordinary Shares into the market for at least as long as our shares are trading below $2.00 per share.\nUntil we can generate significant recurring revenues and profit, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through debt and/or equity financings,\nthrough government grants and receiving the second tranche of the loan from the EIB Agreement. However, there is no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful accomplishing these plans. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we may need to reduce, delay, or adjust our operating expenses,\nincluding commercialization of existing products, or we will be unable to expand our operations as desired.\nWe expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our products reach profitability. As a result of these\nexpected losses and negative cash flows from operations, along with our current cash position, our management and auditors have concluded that these\nconditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting periods. A comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included under the 2023 Annual\nReport.\n10"

Our progress is a testament to our commitment to financial sustainability and long-\nterm growth, and we are excited to share several key milestones that underscore our continued momentum.\nFirst, our project opportunity pipeline remains strong, with a potential value of up to $440 million. This pipeline is crucial to the growth of our bGen thermal energy storage solutions market, and we are confident in\nour ability to successfully mature and execute these opportunities.\nRecent agreements highlight the strides we are making in recurring revenue projects, including:\n• Partner in Pet Food (PPF), Hungary: A 30 MWh bGen system designed to reduce gas usage by 25-30%, while also providing low-carbon steam and grid balancing services.\n• Tempo Beverages, Israel: A 32 MWh installation projected to save $7.5 million over 15 years, while reducing carbon emissions by 6,200 tons annually.\n• Wolfson Hospital, Israel: A $3.55 million project, supported by a $450,000 grant, expected to generate $1.3 million in annual savings and reduce emissions by 3,900 tons.\nOn the financial front, we secured a $1.05 million private placement on August 2, 2024, at a 52% premium, with the potential for an additional $1 million investment if our shares reach $2.50 within the next 12\nmonths. Additionally, on August 30, 2024, we raised approximately $2.0 million in gross proceeds through our At-the-Market (ATM) equity offering facility, selling 914,000 ordinary shares at an average price of\n$2.19 per share. As a result, Brenmiller now has 7,094,791 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\nSince the start of 2024, the Company has raised approximately $10.8 million in gross proceeds, which could reach $11.8 million subject to the closure of the private placement. We are also investing significant\nresources into investor relations campaigns to increase visibility within the investor community. The marked increase in daily trading volume is evidence that these efforts are gaining traction, and we remain\noptimistic that this progress will be reflected in our share price as we continue to pursue new business opportunities.\nWe are also excited to announce a groundbreaking development in AI data center cooling with our bGen Cool solution. This innovation targets the rising demand for Cold Thermal Energy Storage (CTES) and\npositions Brenmiller to capitalize on the decarbonization goals and financial opportunities within the rapidly expanding AI sector.\nFrom a financial perspective, our balance are improving. As of June 30, 2024, cash and equivalents have grown to $6.99 million. Additionally, we have reduced total liabilities by 4% and increased shareholders'\nequity by 127%. Our efforts to streamline operations have paid off, with our net loss narrowing by 70% to $1.58 million compared to the same period last year, largely due to increased financial income.\nLooking ahead, we are on track to have our gigafactory fully operational by the end of 2024, with an annual production capacity of up to 4 GWh of bGen systems. This will significantly enhance our ability to meet\ngrowing market demand and drive future growth.\nThank you for your continued support as we strive to build long-term value through innovation and execution.\nSincerely,\nAvi Brenmiller\nChairman & CEO\nNasdaq: BNRG 4\nFrom Rocks to Thermal Energy Storage\nRocks are crushed Thin metal cells (“bCells”) are\nto small bits filled with the crushed rocks\nbCells are stacked into Modules are assembled\n12 meter modules on-site to a structure\nStructure is insulated\nElectrical heaters\nand connected to plant\nare embedded\nSource : Company materials & website\nNasdaq: BNRG 5\nIntroducing bGenTM Zero\nEmbedded electrical heaters\n100°-500° Steam\nHot air\nDecarbonizing heat through tested thermal energy storage\nSource : Company materials\nNasdaq: BNRG 6\nBrenmiller Overview\n7 103 MWh\nGlobal projects Cumulative projects to date\n~$440m\n4 GWh\nCommercial opportunities\nManufacturing capacity (at full scale)\n~97%\n550˚C\nRound trip efficiency1\nSteam capability\n$118m+ 3,100 TWh\nCapital invested to date Serviceable available market 20302\nSource : Company materials & website, 1 Round trip efficiency = total energy output / total energy input, 2 SystemIQ – Global ETES Opportunity\nNasdaq: BNRG 7\nDevelopment Commercialization\nValidated & ready to scale 103 MWh\nMilestones\n103 MWh to date 12 MWh\nHeat as a service\nagreement\nEurope\n0.5 MWh\nJV MOU\nFull scale Heat as a service\nagreement with\nFounded demonstration\nPartner in Pet Food\n1 MWh\nIDF pilot Expansion to 32 MWh 30 MWh\n4 GWh Heat as a service\nagreement\nIndia MoU\n4 MWh\nUS\nProduct 24 MWh\nCommercial pilot\nDistribution\ndevelopment Power plant pilot\nManufacturing US MoU Agreement\nplant\n22 2\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 710 810 910 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025+\nTECHNOLOGY R&D PILOTS COMMERCIAL\nNasdaq: BNRG 8\nKey Points\nIndustry is the largest emitter of GHG “Everything is going electric”3\n▪ 11 GT CO annually from industrial heat1 ▪ Renewable electricity now cheaper than fossil fuels\n2\n▪ 25% of total global GHG emissions from heat2 ▪ Power to heat efficiency ~97%\nThermal Energy Storage (“TES”) = flexibility for grid Brenmiller is a leader in deployed TES\n▪ TES charges when convenient for wind & solar ▪ 103 MWh in operation & construction\n▪ Minimize curtailment & provide reliable heat ▪ Unique steam-to-steam ability for power plants\nSource: Company materials.

The competition categories are chosen based on the technology gaps that emerge from BNEF’s long-term outlooks on energy, transport and materials.\n\nDescriptions of this year’s challenges, why they were selected, and the finalists for each are outlined below. Also listed are the companies named as “wildcard” finalists, developing technologies that BNEF believes could play an important role in decarbonization but were outside the scope of the three focus challenges.\n\nCongratulations to our 23 finalists!\n\n## Challenge 1: Relieving bottlenecks in the deployment of clean power\n\nThe power sector has a clear path towards decarbonization with the deployment of renewables – particularly solar and wind. Yet while renewables are already being installed at record levels globally, annual solar and wind installations will need to increase threefold by 2031 and sixfold by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions.\n\nToday, deployment is less hindered by costs than by slow grid build-out, grid connection backlogs, permitting challenges and supply-chain constraints. Nearly 600 gigawatts of solar and wind projects are waiting in grid interconnection queues in the top five European renewable energy markets, and more than 1,250 gigawatts wait in the US.\n\n![Grid connectivity](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/pioneers41.jpg)\n\nThe selected finalists focus on grid and utilities software, the planning and siting of renewables, advanced conductors, and energy storage innovations for transmission networks.\n\n**2024 finalists:**\n\n  * [Envelio](https://envelio.com/)\n  * [Fluence](https://fluenceenergy.com/)\n  * [Nira Energy](https://www.niraenergy.com/)\n  * [PVcase](https://pvcase.com/)\n  * [Piclo](https://www.piclo.energy/)\n  * [TS Conductor](https://tsconductor.com/)\n\n\n\n## Challenge 2: Decarbonizing the construction and operation of buildings\n\nBuildings currently account for 33% of global CO2 emissions, but the sector is making little decarbonization progress. Key low-energy technologies for heating and cooling, such as heat pumps, have yet to scale – even though cooling demand for residential buildings is set to increase by 115% by 2050 under BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario, and heating demand could be twice that much.\n\nIn addition, 26% of the world’s steel and 45% of the world’s cement goes into the construction of buildings, and there are currently no commercial routes to eliminating fossil fuels from their production.\n\n![Heat spending](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/pioneers51.jpg)\n\nThe chosen finalists are driving innovation across the domains of heat pumps, refrigeration, cement decarbonization and energy efficiency.\n\n**2024 finalists:**\n\n  * [Aeroseal](https://aeroseal.com/)\n  * [Celsius Energy](https://www.celsiusenergy.com/en/)\n  * [Fortera](https://forteraglobal.com/)\n  * [Hoffmann Green Cement Technologies](https://www.ciments-hoffmann.com/)\n  * [Kelvin Systems](https://kel.vin/)\n  * [Magnotherm Solutions](https://www.magnotherm.com/)\n\n\n\n## Challenge 3: Creating the next generation of net-zero fuels\n\nThe fuel burnt by airplanes, ships and long-haul trucks accounts for 7% of global CO2 emissions. While other forms of transportation, such as passenger vehicles, are set to electrify, heavy-duty transport requires an energy-dense liquid or gaseous fuel. Next-generation fuels need to offer sufficient performance, scalability, economics and sustainability – while limiting land use. Non-food feedstock ‘drop-in’ biofuels, synthetic fuels and other net-zero solutions are evolving to meet these needs.\n\n![Aviation fuel](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/pioneers61.jpg)\n\nThe selected finalists are pioneers in the production of cover crops, hydrogen electrolyzers, e-fuels and biofuels.\n\n**2024 finalists:**\n\n  * [CoverCress](https://www.covercress.com/)\n  * [Infinium](http://www.infiniumco.com)\n  * [Verdagy](https://verdagy.com/)\n  * [Virent](http://www.virent.com/)\n  * [XFuel](https://xfuel.com/)\n\n\n\n## Wildcards\n\nWildcard finalists this year are focused on the sectors of biodiversity monitoring, in-wheel electric-vehicle motors, thermal storage for industrial processes, biogas fuel cells, steel decarbonization and battery innovation.\n\n**2024 finalists:**\n\n  * [Brenmiller Energy](https://bren-energy.com/)\n  * [Element Zero](https://elementzero.green/)\n  * [Li-Metal](https://li-metal.com/)\n  * [NatureMetrics](http://www.naturemetrics.com)\n  * [Orbis Electric](https://www.orbiselectric.com)\n  * [Reverion](https://reverion.com/)\n\n\n\n### About BloombergNEF\n\nBloombergNEF (BNEF) is a strategic research provider covering global commodity markets and the disruptive technologies driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.

(photo credit: Brenmiller Energy)\n\nAn Israeli green energy firm has agreed to provide a Holon-based hospital with electric process heat, replacing its current natural gas-fueled steam boilers. The transition is projected to reduce the hospital’s carbon emissions by 3,900 tons annually and save it $1.3 million yearly in energy costs.\n\nThe [Finance Ministry](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-784490) approved the seven-year, $3.55 million project for Wolfson Hospital, which was first announced in August last year. The facility will purchase a Brenmiller bGen ZERO thermal energy storage (TES) system, which utilizes crushed rocks to store energy in the form of heat and dispatches low-cost steam, hot water, or hot air on demand.\n\nThe system will replace Wolfson’s outdated diesel boilers, which are both costly and polluting.“The project is expected to reduce our fuel oil consumption to nearly zero,” said Gadi Davidovitz, chief engineer at Wolfson Hospital. “It will significantly reduce emissions generated by the hospital while saving on energy costs.”\n\nSome $450,000 of the budget will be covered by a grant from the [Israel Innovation Authority](https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/tech-and-start-ups/article-782362). \n\n![ The Brenmiller system converts electricity into heat to power sustainable industrial processes at a competitive price with natural gas. \\(credit: Brenmiller Energy\\)](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/575681)![Enlrage image](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/zoom-image-icon.svg) The Brenmiller system converts electricity into heat to power sustainable industrial processes at a competitive price with natural gas. (credit: Brenmiller Energy)\n\n### System turns electricity into heat to compete with natural gas\n\n“With our breakthrough bGen ZERO technology, we will provide Wolfson Hospital with a cleaner source of electricity at a lower price than its legacy systems,” said Brenmiller’s Chairman and CEO Avi Brenmiller. “Our sustainable power infrastructure will benefit all hospital stakeholders, from patients and doctors to administrators, government, and local communities.”\n\nThe Brenmiller system converts electricity into heat to power sustainable industrial processes at a competitive price with natural gas. The company’s bGen was named among TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023 in the Green Energy category.Brenmiller said that he hopes that the installation is only the beginning of wide-scale TES adoption in Israel and that it could become the standard for clean energy storage for industrial and municipal facilities in the country and worldwide.\n\n[Sign up for the Business & Innovation Newsletter >>](https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/article-718429)\n\nRelated Tags [electricity](/tags/electricity \"electricity\") [climate change](/tags/climate-change \"climate change\") [Wolfson Medical Center](/tags/wolfson-medical-center \"Wolfson Medical Center\") [Green Energy Implementation](/tags/green-energy-implementation \"Green Energy Implementation\")\n"
