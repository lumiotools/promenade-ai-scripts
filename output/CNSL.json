(Nasdaq: CNSL) (the “Company” or “Consolidated”), a top 10 fiber provider in the U.S., today reported results for third quarter 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue totaled $271.1 million \n  * Overall consumer revenue was $110.3 million \n  * Consumer fiber broadband revenue was $49.0 million \n  * Consumer broadband net adds were 5,134 \n  * Consumer broadband revenue was $82.4 million \n  * Commercial data services revenue was $54.6 million \n  * Carrier data-transport revenue was $30.4 million \n  * Net loss was ($61.4 million). Adjusted EBITDA was $86.5 million \n  * Committed capital expenditures totaled $126.1 million \n\n\n\nCost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses collectively decreased $16.3 million versus the prior year largely due to lower video programming costs, lower severance costs, lower access expense, lower salaries driven by certain cost savings initiatives, and a reduction in contract labor costs. The decrease was partly offset by higher professional fees for system enhancements, customer service improvements and strategic initiatives. \n\nNet interest expense was $44.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million versus the prior year, primarily a result of interest from borrowings on the revolving credit facility. On Sept. 30, 2024, the Company had 71% of its total outstanding debt at a fixed rate through September 2026. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the weighted average cost of debt was 7.09%. \n\nNet loss in the third quarter of 2024 was ($61.4 million) compared to net loss of ($69.2 million) in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per share was ($0.54) in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net loss per share of ($0.61) in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted net (loss) per share excludes certain items as outlined in the table provided in this release. Adjusted diluted net loss per share was ($0.33) compared to ($0.31) in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nTotal committed capital expenditures were $126.1 million, driven by 57,990 new fiber passings and third quarter fiber adds. \n\n**Capital Structure**\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, the Company maintained cash and short-term investments of approximately $44 million, $3 million of available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility and $80 million undrawn under its term loan agreement with Searchlight CVL AGG, L.P. as lender, in each case, subject to customary conditions. \n\nOn Aug. 28, 2024 and Oct. 7, 2024, the Company entered into loan agreements pursuant to which it may borrow up to an aggregate amount of $140 million to fund further buildout of fiber infrastructure. Approximately $44 million was borrowed under such loans as of Sept. 30, 2024. \n\n**Pending Transaction**\n\nAs previously announced on Oct. 16, 2023, Consolidated entered into an agreement to be acquired by affiliates of Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in an all-cash transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion, including the assumption of debt. On Jan. 31, 2024, at a special meeting of shareholders, approximately 75% of shares held by disinterested shareholders voted to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the pending transaction. The transaction, which will result in Consolidated becoming a private company, is expected to close in late fourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. Following the closing of the transaction, shares of Consolidated common stock will no longer be traded or listed on any public securities exchange. \n\nIn light of the transaction, Consolidated will not host an earnings conference call. \n\n**About Consolidated Communications**\n\n[Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.consolidated.com%2F&esheet=54146835&newsitemid=20241104896473&lan=en-US&anchor=Consolidated+Communications+Holdings%2C+Inc&index=1&md5=8d233db6b1d972939b8f5a6df0b294c3).

Accordingly, they should not be construed as alternatives to net cash from operating or investing activities, cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP and are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, not all companies use identical calculations, and the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required by the lenders under our credit agreement in place at the end of each quarter in the periods presented. The tables that follow include an explanation of how adjusted EBITDA is calculated for each of the periods presented with the reconciliation to net income (loss). EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization on a historical basis. \n\nWe present adjusted EBITDA for several reasons. Management believes adjusted EBITDA is useful as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash (including interest on our debt). In addition, we have presented adjusted EBITDA to investors in the past because it is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and management believes presenting it here provides a measure of consistency in our financial reporting. Adjusted EBITDA, referred to as Available Cash in our credit agreement, is also a component of the restrictive covenants and financial ratios contained in our credit agreement that requires us to maintain compliance with these covenants and limit certain activities, such as our ability to incur debt. The definitions in these covenants and ratios are based on Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to specified charges. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides our board of directors with meaningful information, with other data, assumptions and considerations, to measure our ability to service and repay debt. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayment and interest payments are not deducted from such measure. \n\nWe present the non-GAAP measure “adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share” because our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share are regularly affected by items that occur at irregular intervals or are non-cash items. We believe that disclosing these measures assists investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating both our company over time and the relative performance of the companies in our industry. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this press release, including those relating to the current expectations, plans, strategies, and the timeline for consummating the take private transaction with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in late fourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025, are forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These counts are based upon the information available at this time and are subject to updates as additional information becomes available.  \n(3) When a passing is both fiber and DSL/Copper capable it is counted as a fiber passing.  \n(4) Fiber broadband revenue includes revenue from our Kansas City operations, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2022, of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Amounts have not been adjusted to reflect the sale.  \n(5) The sale of our Washington operations in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in a reduction of approximately 37,679 DSL/Copper passings, 6,026 fiber passings, 8,272 DSL/Copper broadband connections, 569 fiber broadband connections, and 4,674 consumer voice connections. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted to reflect the sale.  \n(6) Consumer Broadband net adds and churn for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been normalized to reflect the divestitures of our Kansas City and Ohio operations, which were sold in 2022. Additionally, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, Consumer Broadband net adds and churn have been normalized to reflect the divestiture of the Washington operations, which was sold in the second quarter of 2024.  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241104896473r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor and Media Contacts** Philip Kranz, Investor Relations +1 217-238-8480 Philip.kranz@consolidated.com  Jennifer Spaude, Media Relations +1 507-386-3765 Jennifer.spaude@consolidated.com\n\nSource: Consolidated Communications\n\n[View All News](https://ir.consolidated.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.consolidated.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://ir.consolidated.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## [Investor Contact](/resources/investor-contacts/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

(Nasdaq: CNSL) (the “Company” or “Consolidated”), a top 10 fiber provider in the U.S., today reported results for third quarter 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue totaled $271.1 million \n  * Overall consumer revenue was $110.3 million \n  * Consumer fiber broadband revenue was $49.0 million \n  * Consumer broadband net adds were 5,134 \n  * Consumer broadband revenue was $82.4 million \n  * Commercial data services revenue was $54.6 million \n  * Carrier data-transport revenue was $30.4 million \n  * Net loss was ($61.4 million). Adjusted EBITDA was $86.5 million \n  * Committed capital expenditures totaled $126.1 million \n\n\n\nCost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses collectively decreased $16.3 million versus the prior year largely due to lower video programming costs, lower severance costs, lower access expense, lower salaries driven by certain cost savings initiatives, and a reduction in contract labor costs. The decrease was partly offset by higher professional fees for system enhancements, customer service improvements and strategic initiatives. \n\nNet interest expense was $44.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million versus the prior year, primarily a result of interest from borrowings on the revolving credit facility. On Sept. 30, 2024, the Company had 71% of its total outstanding debt at a fixed rate through September 2026. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the weighted average cost of debt was 7.09%. \n\nNet loss in the third quarter of 2024 was ($61.4 million) compared to net loss of ($69.2 million) in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per share was ($0.54) in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net loss per share of ($0.61) in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted net (loss) per share excludes certain items as outlined in the table provided in this release. Adjusted diluted net loss per share was ($0.33) compared to ($0.31) in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nTotal committed capital expenditures were $126.1 million, driven by 57,990 new fiber passings and third quarter fiber adds. \n\n**Capital Structure**\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, the Company maintained cash and short-term investments of approximately $44 million, $3 million of available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility and $80 million undrawn under its term loan agreement with Searchlight CVL AGG, L.P. as lender, in each case, subject to customary conditions. \n\nOn Aug. 28, 2024 and Oct. 7, 2024, the Company entered into loan agreements pursuant to which it may borrow up to an aggregate amount of $140 million to fund further buildout of fiber infrastructure. Approximately $44 million was borrowed under such loans as of Sept. 30, 2024. \n\n**Pending Transaction**\n\nAs previously announced on Oct. 16, 2023, Consolidated entered into an agreement to be acquired by affiliates of Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in an all-cash transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion, including the assumption of debt. On Jan. 31, 2024, at a special meeting of shareholders, approximately 75% of shares held by disinterested shareholders voted to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the pending transaction. The transaction, which will result in Consolidated becoming a private company, is expected to close in late fourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. Following the closing of the transaction, shares of Consolidated common stock will no longer be traded or listed on any public securities exchange. \n\nIn light of the transaction, Consolidated will not host an earnings conference call. \n\n**About Consolidated Communications**\n\n[Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.consolidated.com%2F&esheet=54146835&newsitemid=20241104896473&lan=en-US&anchor=Consolidated+Communications+Holdings%2C+Inc&index=1&md5=8d233db6b1d972939b8f5a6df0b294c3).

Accordingly, they should not be construed as alternatives to net cash from operating or investing activities, cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP and are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, not all companies use identical calculations, and the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required by the lenders under our credit agreement in place at the end of each quarter in the periods presented. The tables that follow include an explanation of how adjusted EBITDA is calculated for each of the periods presented with the reconciliation to net income (loss). EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization on a historical basis. \n\nWe present adjusted EBITDA for several reasons. Management believes adjusted EBITDA is useful as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash (including interest on our debt). In addition, we have presented adjusted EBITDA to investors in the past because it is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and management believes presenting it here provides a measure of consistency in our financial reporting. Adjusted EBITDA, referred to as Available Cash in our credit agreement, is also a component of the restrictive covenants and financial ratios contained in our credit agreement that requires us to maintain compliance with these covenants and limit certain activities, such as our ability to incur debt. The definitions in these covenants and ratios are based on Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to specified charges. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides our board of directors with meaningful information, with other data, assumptions and considerations, to measure our ability to service and repay debt. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayment and interest payments are not deducted from such measure. \n\nWe present the non-GAAP measure “adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share” because our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share are regularly affected by items that occur at irregular intervals or are non-cash items. We believe that disclosing these measures assists investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating both our company over time and the relative performance of the companies in our industry. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this press release, including those relating to the current expectations, plans, strategies, and the timeline for consummating the take private transaction with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in late fourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025, are forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These counts are based upon the information available at this time and are subject to updates as additional information becomes available.  \n(3) When a passing is both fiber and DSL/Copper capable it is counted as a fiber passing.  \n(4) Fiber broadband revenue includes revenue from our Kansas City operations, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2022, of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Amounts have not been adjusted to reflect the sale.  \n(5) The sale of our Washington operations in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in a reduction of approximately 37,679 DSL/Copper passings, 6,026 fiber passings, 8,272 DSL/Copper broadband connections, 569 fiber broadband connections, and 4,674 consumer voice connections. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted to reflect the sale.  \n(6) Consumer Broadband net adds and churn for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been normalized to reflect the divestitures of our Kansas City and Ohio operations, which were sold in 2022. Additionally, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, Consumer Broadband net adds and churn have been normalized to reflect the divestiture of the Washington operations, which was sold in the second quarter of 2024.  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241104896473r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor and Media Contacts** Philip Kranz, Investor Relations +1 217-238-8480 Philip.kranz@consolidated.com  Jennifer Spaude, Media Relations +1 507-386-3765 Jennifer.spaude@consolidated.com\n\nSource: Consolidated Communications\n\n[View All News](https://ir.consolidated.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.consolidated.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://ir.consolidated.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## [Investor Contact](/resources/investor-contacts/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness and Basis of Accounting\nConsolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company with operating\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Consolidated”) that provide communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier\ncustomers across a service area in over 20 states.\nLeveraging our advanced fiber network spanning nearly 66,000 fiber route miles, we offer residential high-speed Internet,\nphone and home security services as well as a comprehensive business product suite including: data and Internet solutions,\nvoice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and an expanded suite of cloud services.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and related condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), mezzanine equity and shareholders’ equity and cash\nflows include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”) for interim financial information\nand pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and\nfootnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been\ncondensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations and accounting principles applicable for interim periods.\nEvents subsequent to the balance sheet date have been evaluated for inclusion in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements through the date of issuance. Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the\ninformation presented not misleading. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information\npresented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial\nstatements (“Notes”) thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with\nthe SEC.\nRecent Developments\nMerger Agreement\nOn October 15, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Condor Holdings\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”) affiliated with certain funds managed by affiliates of Searchlight\nCapital Partners, L.P. (“Searchlight”), and Condor Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of\nParent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nthe Company (the “Merger”) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of an\naffiliate of Searchlight. British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (“BCI”) and certain affiliates of Searchlight\nhave committed to provide equity financing to Parent to fund the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nSearchlight is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 33% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock\nand is the holder of 100% of the Company’s outstanding Series A perpetual preferred stock. Refer to Note 4 for a more\ncomplete discussion of the strategic investment with Searchlight. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share\n(other than shares of the Company’s common stock (i) held directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of\nthe Company, (ii) held by the Company as treasury shares or (iii) held by any person who properly exercises appraisal rights\nunder Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $4.70 per share, without interest\n(the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. In addition, pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, (i) Company restricted share awards (“Company RSAs”) held by\nnon-employee directors or by certain affiliates of Searchlight will vest and be canceled in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration and (ii) all other Company RSAs will be converted into restricted cash awards based on the Merger\nConsideration and subject to the same terms and conditions, including time-\n6\nTable of Contents\nand performance-based vesting conditions, as the corresponding Company RSA (except that the relative total shareholder\nreturn modifier shall be deemed to be achieved at the target level).\nThe Merger Agreement has, unanimously by the directors present, been approved by the board of directors of the Company\n(the “Board”), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee consisting of only independent and\ndisinterested directors of the Company (the “Special Committee”). On January 31, 2024, the Company held a virtual special\nmeeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) to consider three proposals with respect to the Merger Agreement. The first\nproposal, to adopt the Merger Agreement, was approved by (i) holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the\nissued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and (ii) holders of a majority of the\nvoting power represented by the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and\nheld by Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The second proposal, to approve by advisory (non-\nbinding) vote the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in\nconnection with the consummation of the Merger, was approved by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders. The\nthird proposal, to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there were\ninsufficient votes in favor of the Merger Agreement proposal, was also approved by the requisite vote of the Company’s\nstockholders. Because the Merger Agreement proposal was approved by the requisite vote, no adjournment to solicit\nadditional proxies was necessary.\nThe proposed transaction constitutes a “going-private transaction” under the rules of the SEC and is expected to close in late\nfourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025. The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i) the\nexpiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”); (ii) the receipt of certain required consents or approvals from (a) the\nFederal Communications Commission, (b) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (c) state public utility\ncommissions and (d) local regulators in connection with the provision of telecommunications and media services; (iii) the\nabsence of any order, injunction or decree restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation\nof the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations\nand warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, as of the date of the\nMerger Agreement and the date of closing, and performance in all material respects of the covenants and agreements\ncontained in the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The waiting period under the HSR\nAct expired on May 9, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. This satisfied the closing condition related to the U.S. antitrust clearance of the\ntransaction. We are awaiting the other required regulatory approvals in order to execute the Merger. Following the closing of\nthe transaction, shares of our common stock will no longer be traded or listed on any public securities exchange.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable (“AR”) consists primarily of amounts due to the Company from normal business activities. We maintain\nan allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) based on our historical loss experience, current conditions and forecasted changes\nincluding but not limited to changes related to the economy, our industry and business. Uncollectible accounts are written-off\n(removed from AR and charged against the ACL) when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. Subsequently, if\npayment is received from the customer, the recovery is credited to the ACL.\n7\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the activity in ACL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of year $13,469 $11,470\nProvision charged to expense 6,313 6,330\nWrite-offs, less recoveries (6,205) (4,764)\nBalance at end of year $13,577 $13,036\nAccounts Receivable - Other\nWe may be awarded grants from federal and state governments to assist in the deployment of broadband in order to support\naccess to high-speed broadband services in underserved or unserved areas. The awards may include a number of regulatory\nrequirements including the completion of construction by certain dates. Funding from the grants may be received in advance,\nupon completion of the project or when certain milestones are achieved. The grants are accounted for as a contribution in aid\nof construction given the nature of the arrangement and are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment as the\nprojects are completed. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, AR included amounts due to the Company of $25.4\nmillion and $7.0 million, respectively, related to grant funding or other special construction projects.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-\n07 (“ASU 2023-07”), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The new guidance is\neffective on retrospective basis for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 with\nearly adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 (“ASU 2023-09”), Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures. Amendments in ASU 2023-09 require additional income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective\nbasis. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our income tax disclosures.\n2. REVENUE\nNature of Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue contracts with customers may include a promise or promises to deliver goods such as equipment and/or services\nsuch as broadband, video or voice services. Promised goods and services are considered distinct as the customer can benefit\nfrom the goods or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and\nthe Company’s promise to transfer a good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the\ncontract. The Company accounts for goods and services as separate performance obligations. Each service is considered a\nsingle performance obligation as it is providing a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same\npattern of transfer.\nThe transaction price is determined at contract inception and reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring a good or service to the customer. This amount is generally equal to the market price of\nthe goods and/or services promised in the contract and may include promotional discounts. The transaction price excludes\namounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes and regulatory fees. Conversely, nonrefundable upfront fees,\nsuch as service activation and set-up fees, are included in the transaction price. In determining the transaction price, we\nconsider our enforceable rights and obligations within the contract. We do not consider the possibility of a contract being\ncancelled, renewed or modified.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of the good or service,\nnet of the related discount, as applicable.\nRevenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the good or service to the\ncustomer.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating Revenues\nConsumer:\nBroadband (Data and VoIP) $ 82,377 $ 75,089 $ 243,664 $ 214,389\nVoice services 27,927 31,616 84,228 95,231\nVideo services — 8,541 9,938 27,497\n110,304 115,246 337,830 337,117\nCommercial:\nData services (includes VoIP) 54,631 53,870 163,883 160,234\nVoice services 31,518 31,825 92,738 96,692\nOther 9,402 9,228 26,661 29,362\n95,551 94,923 283,282 286,288\nCarrier:\nData and transport services 30,370 31,388 91,681 95,535\nVoice services 3,428 4,090 10,832 12,720\nOther 267 262 786 925\n34,065 35,740 103,299 109,180\nSubsidies 5,934 6,878 19,113 20,986\nNetwork access 21,974 20,842 65,585 68,033\nOther products and services 3,260 10,025 5,363 13,338\nTotal operating revenues $ 271,088 $ 283,654 $ 814,472 $ 834,942\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table provides information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from our revenue contracts\nwith customers:\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nAccounts receivable, net $ 139,338 $ 107,361\nContract assets 50,062 34,830\nContract liabilities 62,296 55,690\nContract assets include costs that are incremental to the acquisition of a contract. Incremental costs are those that result\ndirectly from obtaining a contract or costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, which\nprimarily relate to sales commissions and certain contract fulfillment costs. These costs are deferred and amortized over the\nexpected customer life. We determined that the expected customer life is the expected period of benefit as the commission on\nthe renewal contract is not commensurate with the commission on the initial contract. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized expense of $4.5 million and $3.3 million,\n9\nTable of Contents\nrespectively, related to deferred contract acquisition costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany recognized expense of $12.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to deferred contract acquisition costs.\nContract liabilities include deferred revenues related to advanced payments for services and nonrefundable, upfront service\nactivation and set-up fees, which are generally deferred and amortized over the expected customer life as the option to renew\nwithout paying an upfront fee provides the customer with a material right. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company recognized previously deferred revenues of $119.5 million and $111.9 million, respectively. For\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized previously deferred revenues of $348.4\nmillion and $333.4 million, respectively.\nA receivable is recognized in the period the Company provides goods or services when the Company’s right to consideration\nis unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are generally 30 to 60 days.\nPerformance Obligations\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), requires that the Company disclose the aggregate\namount of the transaction price that is allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of September 30,\n2024. The guidance provides certain practical expedients that limit this requirement. The service revenue contracts of the\nCompany meet the following practical expedients provided by ASC 606:\n1. The performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\n2. Revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the\ncustomer in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-18.\nThe Company has elected these practical expedients. Performance obligations related to our service revenue contracts are\ngenerally satisfied over time. For services transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on amounts invoiced to the\ncustomer as the Company has concluded that the invoice amount directly corresponds with the value of services provided to\nthe customer. Management considers this a faithful depiction of the transfer of control as services are substantially the same\nand have the same pattern of transfer over the life of the contract. As such, revenue related to unsatisfied performance\nobligations that will be billed in future periods has not been disclosed.\n3. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings\nallocation method that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating securities considering dividends\ndeclared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Common stock related to certain of the Company’s restricted stock\nawards are considered participating securities because holders are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends, if declared,\nduring the vesting term.\nThe potentially dilutive impact of the Company’s restricted stock awards is determined using the treasury stock method.\nUnder the treasury stock method, if the average market price during the period exceeds the exercise price, these instruments\nare treated as if they had been exercised with the proceeds of exercise used to repurchase common stock at the average market\nprice during the period. Any incremental difference between the assumed number of shares issued and repurchased is\nincluded in the diluted share computation.\nDiluted EPS includes securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS during a reporting period. Dilutive securities are not\nincluded in the computation of loss per share when a company reports a net loss from continuing operations as the impact\nwould be anti-dilutive.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS attributable to common shareholders computed using the two-class method is as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (48,972) $ (57,720) $ (139,183) $ (202,773)\nLess: dividends on Series A preferred stock 12,348 11,305 35,727 32,596\nLess: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 99 137 357 441\nLoss attributable to common shareholders $ (61,419) $ (69,162) $ (175,267) $ (235,810)\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding 114,303 113,054 114,231 113,015\nNet loss per common share attributable to common shareholders -\nbasic and diluted $ (0.54) $ (0.61) $ (1.53) $ (2.09)\nDiluted EPS attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 excludes 4.2\nmillion and 3.5 million potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plan, respectively, because the\ninclusion of the potential common shares would have an antidilutive effect. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, diluted EPS attributable to common shareholders excludes 3.7 million and 3.2 million potential common shares,\nrespectively.\n4. SEARCHLIGHT INVESTMENT\nIn connection with the Investment Agreement entered into on September 13, 2020, affiliates of Searchlight committed to\ninvest up to an aggregate of $425.0 million in the Company. The investment commitment was structured in two stages. In the\nfirst stage of the transaction, which was completed on October 2, 2020, Searchlight invested $350.0 million in the Company in\nexchange for 6,352,842 shares, or approximately 8%, of the Company’s common stock and was issued a CPR that was\nconvertible, upon the receipt of certain regulatory and shareholder approvals, into an additional 17,870,012 shares, or 16.9%,\nof the Company’s common stock. In addition, Searchlight received the right to an unsecured subordinated note with an\naggregate principal amount of approximately $395.5 million (the “Note”), which was convertible into shares of a new series\nof perpetual preferred stock of the Company with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of the\nNote plus accrued interest as of the date of conversion.\nOn July 15, 2021, the Company received all required state public utility commission regulatory approvals necessary for the\nconversion of the CPR into 16.9% additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, the CPR was converted into\n17,870,012 shares of common stock, which were issued to Searchlight on July 16, 2021.\nIn the second stage of the transaction, which was completed on December 7, 2021 following the receipt of Federal\nCommunications Commission (“FCC”) and certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain other customary\nclosing conditions, Searchlight invested an additional $75.0 million and was issued the Note. On December 7, 2021,\nSearchlight elected to convert the Note into 434,266 shares of Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share\n(the “Series A Preferred Stock”). In addition, the CPR converted into an additional 15,115,899 shares, or an additional 10.1%,\nof the Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total shares of common stock issued\nto Searchlight represent approximately 33% and 34% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively.\nOn December 7, 2021, Searchlight exercised its option to convert the Note and the net carrying value of the Note of $285.9\nmillion, net of unamortized discount and issuance costs of $139.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, was converted into\n434,266 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Dividends on the Series A\nPreferred Stock accrue daily on the liquidation preference at a rate of 9.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. The\nliquidation preference per share is adjusted to include any paid-in-kind dividends. See Note 11 for more information on the\nterms of the Series A Preferred Stock.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWith the strategic investment from Searchlight, we have enhanced our fiber infrastructure and accelerated the investment in\nour network, which will include the upgrade of approximately 1.6 million passings across select service areas to enable multi-\nGig capable services to these homes and small businesses. Our fiber build plan includes the upgrade of approximately 150,000\nhomes and small businesses in 2024.\n5. DIVESTITURES\nWashington Operations\nOn July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding stock of our business located\nin Washington, Consolidated Communications of Comerco Company (“CCCC”), which directly owns all of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Consolidated Communications of Washington Company (“CCWC” and together with CCCC”, the\n“Washington operations”), for gross cash proceeds of approximately $73.0 million, subject to customary working capital\nadjustments and other post-closing purchase price adjustments. The sale closed on May 1, 2024.

As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of $77.8 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an additional loss on the sale of $0.5\nmillion, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of\noperations as a result of changes in estimated working capital adjustments and selling costs.\nKansas City Operations\nOn March 2, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all the assets of our business located in the\nKansas City market (the “Kansas City operations”).

The investment in CoBank represents the accumulation\nof the equity patronage paid by CoBank to the Company.\n7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur derivative instruments related to interest rate swap agreements are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined using valuation models and are categorized within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and observable market data of similar instruments.\nSee Note 9 for further discussion regarding our interest rate swap agreements.\nOur interest rate swap agreements measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 were as follows:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices Significant\nIn Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLong-term interest rate swap liabilities $ (5,302) $ — $ (5,302) $ —\nAs of December 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices Significant\nIn Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLong-term interest rate swap liabilities $ (2,421) $ — $ (2,421) $ —\nWe have not elected the fair value option for any of our other assets or liabilities.

The Credit Agreement consisted of term loans in an original aggregate amount of $1,250.0 million (the “Term\nLoans”) and a revolving loan facility of $250.0 million. The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental loan facility which\nprovides the ability to borrow, subject to certain terms and conditions, incremental loans in an aggregate amount of up to the\ngreater of (a) $300.0 million plus (b) an amount which would not cause its senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed\n3.70:1.00 (the “Incremental Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of\nthe Company and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loans have a maturity date of October 2, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of 3.50% plus Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a 0.75% SOFR floor) plus a SOFR adjustment. As part of the replacement to SOFR-\nbenchmark rates in 2023, borrowings will include an adjustment of 0.11%, 0.26% and 0.43% for borrowings of one, three and\nsix month loans, respectively. On March 18, 2021, the Company repaid $397.0 million of the then outstanding Term Loans\nwith the net proceeds received from the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior secured notes\ndue 2028 (the “5.00% Senior Notes”), as described below. The repayment of the Term Loans was applied to the remaining\nprincipal payments in direct order of maturity, thereby eliminating the required quarterly principal payments through the\nremaining term of the loan.\nThe revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 2, 2027 (subject to springing maturity on April 2, 2027 if the Term\nLoans, as of April 1, 2027, are scheduled to mature earlier than March 31, 2028) and an applicable margin (at our election) of\n4.00% for SOFR-based borrowings or 3.00% for alternate base rate borrowings, with a 0.25% reduction in each case if the\nconsolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, does not exceed 3.20 to 1.00. As\n14\nTable of Contents\nof September 30, 2024, borrowings of $200.0 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. At December 31,\n2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Stand-by letters of credit of $46.7 million were\noutstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. The stand-by letters of credit are renewable annually\nand reduce the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, $3.3 million was available\nfor borrowing under the revolving credit facility, subject to certain covenants. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of $212.0\nmillion and stand-by letters of credit of $35.4 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 8.89% and 8.96% as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nCredit Agreement Covenant Compliance\nThe Credit Agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to\npay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue certain capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial\nratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Among other things, it\nwill be an event of default, with respect to the revolving credit facility only, if our consolidated first lien leverage ratio is\ngreater than 7.75:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, if on such date the testing threshold is met. The testing threshold is\nmet if the aggregate amount of our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceeds 35%. As of September\n30, 2024, the testing threshold was met and our consolidated first lien leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement was below\n7.75:1.00. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants.\nOn October 15, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) to,\namong other things, increase the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (the “Step-Up”) permitted under the Credit\nAgreement to (i) 7.75 to 1.00, from October 15, 2023 to and including December 31, 2024, (ii) 7.50 to 1.00, from and\nincluding January 1, 2025 to and including March 31, 2025, (iii) 7.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2025 to and\nincluding June 30, 2025, (iv) 7.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2025 to and including September 30, 2025, (v) 6.75 to\n1.00 from and including October 1, 2025 to and including December 31, 2025, (vi) 6.50 to 1.00, from and including January 1,\n2026 to and including March 31, 2026, (vii) 6.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2026 to and including June 30, 2026,\n(viii) 6.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2026 to and including September 30, 2026, and (ix) 5.85 to 1.00 from and\nincluding October 1, 2026 and thereafter (the “Step-Up Period”). While the Step-Up is in effect, the Company will be subject\nto additional restrictions on its ability to make certain investments and restricted payments (the “Restrictions”). The Step-Up\nPeriod and the Restrictions will end and the maximum Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio will revert to the levels set\nforth in the Credit Agreement on the earlier of (a) the Company’s election and (b) August 1, 2025, to the extent $300.0 million\nin cash proceeds have not been received by the Company from equity contributed to its capital by such date. If the proposed\nMerger is not completed by August 1, 2025, the increase in the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio as permitted in\nthe Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to provide interim financial covenant relief will end and the maximum\nconsolidated first lien leverage ratio will revert to 5.85 to 1.00.\nFiber Broadband Term Loans\nOn August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, the Company entered into loan agreements (the “Loan Agreements”), pursuant to\nwhich the Company may borrow up to an aggregate amount of $80.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, in delayed draw\nterm loans to fund further development and construction of fiber infrastructure. Outstanding borrowings under the Loan\nAgreements will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum, payable semi-annually. The term of the loans is four years\nfrom the initial advance with an option to extend the maturity by two one-year periods, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nThe borrowings are senior secured obligations of the Company and the Loan Agreements contain negative covenants\nsubstantively similar to the existing Credit Agreement and other covenants customary for facilities of this type. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, borrowings of $43.8 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreement entered into on August 28,\n2024. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of $51.8 million and $5.6 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreements\nentered into on August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, respectively.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSearchlight Term Loan\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and Searchlight, as lender entered into a\nTerm Loan Agreement (the “Searchlight Loan Agreement”), which consists of delayed draw term loans in the aggregate\namount of $80.0 million (the “Loan”). The Searchlight Loan Agreement provides us with the ability to borrow on the Loan in\nthe event either (a) the aggregate amount of available loans to be drawn under the revolving credit facility is less than $25.0\nmillion or (b) drawing under the revolving credit facility would trigger the financial maintenance covenant thereunder and we\nwould not be in compliance with such covenant on a pro forma basis, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain other\ncustomary conditions.\nIn the event the Loan is ever drawn, we intend to apply the proceeds from the Loan to directly or indirectly fund capital\nexpenditures for our fiber broadband expansion plan. The Searchlight Loan Agreement is unsecured and the Loan will mature\non April 2, 2027. Drawn amounts on the Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable rate ranging from 12.0%\nper annum, which applies prior to the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date (unless the Merger Agreement is\nterminated pursuant to the Company’s breach thereof), to the amount required for Searchlight to realize a multiple on invested\ncapital of 1.75x on the Loan, which applies on and after the earlier of (i) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated\npursuant to the Company’s breach thereof and (ii) the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date.\nThe Searchlight Loan Agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants consistent with the\nCompany’s existing credit agreement. The Searchlight Loan Agreement requires, in the event the Merger Agreement is\nterminated and any amounts in respect of the Loan remain outstanding, for the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated\nfirst lien leverage ratio. The Searchlight Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited\nto, nonpayment, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violations of covenants, nonpayment of other material\ndebts, certain bankruptcy and liquidations, certain material judgments, and certain events related to the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 2, 2020, we completed an offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% unsubordinated secured\nnotes due 2028 (the “6.50% Senior Notes”). The 6.50% Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 6.50%,\npayable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2028.\nOn March 18, 2021, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount 5.00% Senior Notes, together with the 6.50%\nSenior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The 5.00% Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year,\npayable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021. The 5.00% Senior Notes mature\non October 1, 2028. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.00% Senior Notes were used to repay $397.0 million of the\nTerm Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Senior Notes are unsubordinated secured obligations of the Company, secured by a first priority lien on the collateral that\nsecures the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on\na first priority secured basis by the Company and the majority of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The offerings of the Senior\nNotes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any state securities laws.\nSenior Notes Covenant Compliance\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants that,\namong other things, limits the Company and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain\npreferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or\nredeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other\npayments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions\nwith its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indentures also contain customary\n16\nTable of Contents\nevents of default. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under\nthe indentures governing the Senior Notes.\n9. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. Our\ninterest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, thereby reducing the\nimpact of interest rate changes on future cash interest payments. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in\nour condensed consolidated balance sheets. We may designate certain of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our\nexpected future interest payments. For derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value is\nrecognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and is recognized as an adjustment\nto earnings over the period in which the hedged item impacts earnings. When an interest rate swap agreement terminates, any\nresulting gain or loss is recognized over the shorter of the remaining original term of the hedging instrument or the remaining\nlife of the underlying debt obligation. If a derivative instrument is de-designated, the remaining gain or loss in AOCI on the\ndate of de-designation is amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedging instrument. For derivative financial\ninstruments that are not designated as a hedge, including those that have been de-designated, changes in fair value are\nrecognized on a current basis in earnings. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified under the same category as the\ncash flows from the hedged items in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following interest rate swaps were outstanding as of September 30, 2024:\nNotional\n(In thousands) Amount 2024 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value\nCash Flow Hedges:\nFixed to 1-month floating SOFR $ 500,000 Other long-term liabilities $ (5,302)\nOur fixed to 1-month floating SOFR interest rate swap agreements, which became effective July 31, 2023, have a fixed rate of\n3.941% and mature on September 30, 2026.\nThe following interest rate swaps were outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nNotional\n(In thousands) Amount 2023 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value\nCash Flow Hedges:\nFixed to 1-month floating SOFR $ 500,000 Other long-term liabilities $ (2,421)\nThe counterparties to our various swaps are highly rated financial institutions. None of the swap agreements provide for either\nus or the counterparties to post collateral nor do the agreements include any covenants related to the financial condition of\nConsolidated or the counterparties. The swaps of any counterparty that is a lender, as defined in our credit facility, are secured\nalong with the other creditors under the credit facility. Each of the swap agreements provides that in the event of a bankruptcy\nfiling by either Consolidated or the counterparty, any amounts owed between the two parties would be offset in order to\ndetermine the net amount due between parties.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total pre-tax unrealized loss related to our interest rate swap\nagreements included in AOCI was $(5.3) million and $(2.4) million, respectively. From the balance in AOCI as of September\n30, 2024, we expect to recognize a loss of approximately $1.0 million in earnings in the next twelve months.\nInformation regarding our cash flow hedge transactions is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized in AOCI, pretax $ (8,865) $ 5,880 $ 2,425 $ 10,013\nDeferred gain reclassified from AOCI to interest expense $ 1,790 $ 2,334 $ 5,306 $ 8,243\n17\nTable of Contents\n10. LEASES\nLessor\nWe have various arrangements for use of our network assets for which we are the lessor, including tower space, certain\ncolocation, conduit and dark fiber arrangements. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease\nincome associated with these types of leases is not material. Occasionally, we enter into arrangements where the term may be\nfor a major part of the asset’s remaining economic life such as in indefeasible right of use (“IRU”) arrangements for dark fiber\nor conduit, which meet the criteria for sales-type lease classification. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any such arrangements.\n11. MEZZANINE EQUITY\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. The\ndesignated Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on\nthe distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company\nand redemption rights. The following is a summary of certain provisions under the Certificate of Designations of the Series A\nPerpetual Preferred Stock (“Certificate of Designations”).\nDividends\nDividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock accrue daily on the liquidation preference at a rate of 9.0% per annum\nand will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Subsequent to a waiver issued by\nSearchlight in November 2022 as described below, dividends are payable until October 2, 2027 at our election, either in cash\nor in-kind through an accrual of unpaid dividends, which are automatically added to the liquidation preference; and after\nOctober 2, 2027, solely in cash. The liquidation preference at the time of issuance is $1,000 per share, as adjusted to include\nany paid-in-kind dividends. In the event that the Company’s Board of Directors fails to declare and pay dividends in cash\nafter October 2, 2027, among other conditions, the dividend rate applicable to each subsequent dividend period will increase\nto 11.0%.\nOn November 22, 2022, in connection with entering into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, Searchlight waived\nfor two years, until October 2, 2027, the obligation under the Certificate of Designations to begin paying in cash after October\n2, 2025 rather than being permitted to accrue dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Any dividend not declared and fully\npaid in cash during the waiver period or otherwise, will continue to accrue in accordance with the Certificate of Designations\nand be reflected as additional per share liquidation preference.\nRedemption\nUpon a fundamental change such as a change of control, liquidation, dissolution or winding up event, holders of the Series A\nPreferred Stock will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the outstanding Series A Preferred\nStock for cash at a price equal the liquidation preference and accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the\nfundamental change date.\nThe Company may, at its option redeem all or any part of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase\nprice per share in cash equal to the sum of the liquidation preference and accrued and unpaid dividends. A premium may also\nbe payable in connection with any such redemption.\n18\nTable of Contents\nVoting Rights\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters specifically related to the Series A Preferred\nStock. The holders do not otherwise have any voting rights. If preferred dividends have not been paid in cash in full for two\ndividend periods after October 2, 2027, whether or not consecutive, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting\ntogether as a single class, will be entitled to elect two additional directors to the board of directors.\nIn accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the Series A Preferred Stock is classified as mezzanine\nequity in the consolidated balance sheets due to a deemed liquidation feature, which gives holders the right to require the\nCompany to redeem all or any part of the holders’ Series A Preferred Stock for cash in the event of a fundamental change or\nchange in control. We have not adjusted the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock to its liquidation value since the\nsecurities are not currently redeemable nor is it probable that they will become redeemable. Subsequent adjustments to\nincrease the carrying value to the liquidation value will be made only if and when it becomes probable that such a deemed\nliquidation event will occur.\nOn December 7, 2021, upon the completion of the Searchlight investment as described in Note 4, we issued 434,266 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock with a carrying value of $285.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the liquidation preference of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock was $521.0 million, which included accrued and unpaid dividends of $22.4 million. On January 2,\n2024 and July 1, 2024, the Company paid dividends in-kind of $22.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively. As of September\n30, 2024, the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock was $556.7 million, which includes accrued and unpaid\ndividends of $12.3 million. Searchlight is the sole holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A\nPreferred Stock. The Company intends to exercise the paid-in-kind dividend option on the Series A Preferred Stock through at\nleast 2025.\n12. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur Board of Directors (or its Compensation Committee) may grant share-based awards from our shareholder approved\nConsolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and/or restated (the “Plan”). The Plan\npermits the issuance of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants, and stock unit grants to\neligible directors and employees at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. On February 26,\n2023, our Board of Directors adopted, and on May 1, 2023, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Plan to increase\nby 5,280,000 shares the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan. With the amendment,\napproximately 15,330,000 shares of our common stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan, provided that in any\ncalendar year an eligible employee may be granted no more than 300,000 stock options or 300,000 stock appreciation rights,\nand a non-employee director may be granted no more than 25,000 stock options or 25,000 stock appreciation rights. In\naddition, stock awards and stock unit awards granted to an employee in any calendar year may not cover shares having a fair\nmarket value on the date of grant that exceeds $6,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of a non-employee director). Unless\nterminated sooner, the Plan will continue in effect until April 30, 2028.\nThe following table summarizes total compensation costs recognized for share-based payments during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestricted stock $ 1,628 $ 1,263 $ 4,419 $ 3,426\nPerformance shares 1,010 998 2,930 2,022\nTotal $ 2,638 $ 2,261 $ 7,349 $ 5,448\nShare-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and\nPerformance Share Awards (“PSAs”) was $15.3 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\napproximately 1.6 years.\nThe following table summarizes the RSA and PSA activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024:\nRSAs PSAs\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Grant Average Grant\nShares Date Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value\nNon-vested shares outstanding - December 31, 2023 1,491,997 $ 3.78 690,822 $ 7.28\nShares granted 2,072,248 $ 4.31 548,075 $ 3.17\nShares vested (75,943) $ 4.03 (384,811) $ 7.66\nShares forfeited, cancelled or retired (48,084) $ 3.83 (120,236) $ 5.86\nNon-vested shares outstanding - September 30, 2024 3,440,218 $ 4.09 733,850 $ 4.24\nAt September 30, 2024, we had 2.3 million PSAs outstanding for which performance condition achievement has not yet been\ndetermined, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3.89. The PSAs are earned upon the achievement of\npredetermined goals over the performance periods, which range from one to three years. Depending on performance, a\nnumber of shares equal to 0% to 150% of the target PSAs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 may be issued as restricted\nstock once the performance periods are completed.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by component for the nine-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024:\nPension and\nPost-Retirement Derivative\n(In thousands) Obligations Instruments Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (20,084) $ (1,788) $ (21,872)\nOther comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassifications — 1,790 1,790\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1,366) (3,917) (5,283)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (1,366) (2,127) (3,493)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (21,450) $ (3,915) $ (25,365)\nThe following table summarizes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September\nSeptember 30, 30, Affected Line Item in the\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Statement of Operations\nAmortization of pension and post-\nretirement items:\nPrior service credit $ 130 $ 132 $ 391 $ 397 (a)\nActuarial gain 487 1,223 1,461 3,669 (a)\n617 1,355 1,852 4,066 Total before tax\n(162) (356) (486) (1,069) Tax expense\n$ 455 $ 999 $ 1,366 $ 2,997 Net of tax\nGain on cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate derivatives $ 1,790 $ 2,334 $ 5,306 $ 8,243 Interest expense\n(468) (610) (1,389) (2,153) Tax expense\n$ 1,322 $ 1,724 $ 3,917 $ 6,090 Net of tax\n20\nTable of Contents\n(a) These items are included in the components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other post-\nretirement benefit plans.

PENSION PLAN AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans that are non-contributory covering substantially all of our hourly\nemployees under collective bargaining agreements who fulfill minimum age and service requirements and certain salaried\nemployees. The defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new entrants. All of our defined benefit pension plans are now\nfrozen to all current employees, and no additional monthly pension benefits will accrue under those plans.\nWe also maintain non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (the “Supplemental Plans” and, together with the defined\nbenefit pension plans, the “Pension Plans”). The Supplemental Plans provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain\nformer employees by providing for incremental pension payments to partially offset the reduction of the amount that would\nhave been payable under the qualified defined benefit pension plans if it were not for limitations imposed by federal income\ntax regulations. The Supplemental Plans are closed to all new entrants. These plans are unfunded and have no assets. The\nbenefits paid under the Supplemental Plans are paid from the general operating funds of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) for our Pension Plans for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 6,671 $ 7,357 $ 20,013 $ 22,070\nExpected return on plan assets (6,659) (7,850) (19,979) (23,550)\nNet amortization loss 209 72 629 216\nNet prior service cost amortization 31 31 92 92\nNet periodic pension cost (benefit) $ 252 $ (390) $ 755 $ (1,172)\nThe components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) other than the service cost component are included in other, net within\nother income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nPost-retirement Benefit Obligations\nWe sponsor various healthcare and life insurance plans (“Post-retirement Plans”) that provide post-retirement medical and life\ninsurance benefits to certain groups of retired employees. Certain plans are frozen so that no person is eligible to become a\nnew participant. Retirees share in the cost of healthcare benefits, making contributions that are adjusted periodically—either\nbased upon collective bargaining agreements or because total costs of the program have changed. Covered expenses for\nretiree health benefits are paid as they are incurred. Post-retirement life insurance benefits are fully insured. A majority of the\nhealthcare plans are unfunded and have no assets, and benefits are paid from the general operating funds of the Company.\nHowever, a certain healthcare plan is funded by assets that are separately designated within the Pension Plans for the sole\npurpose of providing payments of retiree medical benefits for this specific plan.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the components of the net periodic benefit for our Post-retirement Plans for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nService cost $ 20 $ 19 $ 62 $ 57\nInterest cost 692 749 2,078 2,249\nExpected return on plan assets (45) (47) (136) (141)\nNet amortization gain (696) (1,295) (2,090) (3,885)\nNet prior service credit amortization (161) (163) (483) (489)\nNet periodic post-retirement benefit $ (190) $ (737) $ (569) $ (2,209)\nThe components of net periodic post-retirement benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in other, net\nwithin other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nContributions\nWe elected to participate in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) beginning with the 2021 plan year. ARPA,\nwhich was signed into law in March 2021, included changes to the employer funding requirements and is designed to reduce\nthe amounts of required contributions to provide funding relief for employers. During 2021 and the six months ended June 30,\n2022, we elected to fund our pension contributions at the pre-ARPA levels, which has created a pre-funded balance. We intend\nto use our current pre-funded balance to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements until the balance is exhausted, which\nis expected to occur in late 2024. We expect to contribute approximately $0.2 million to our Pension Plans and $5.7 million to\nour Post-retirement Plans in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have contributed $0.2 million and $5.0 million of the annual\ncontribution to the Pension Plans and Post-retirement Plans, respectively.\n14. INCOME TAXES\nOur unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $4.9 million. The net amount of\nunrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in an impact to the effective tax rate is $4.7 million as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We do not expect any material change in our unrecognized tax benefits during the\nremainder of 2024.\nOur practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have a material liability for interest or penalties\nand had no material interest or penalty expense.\nThe periods subject to examination for our federal return are years 2020 through 2023. The periods subject to examination for\nour state returns are years 2019 through 2023. In addition, prior tax years may be subject to examination by federal or state\ntaxing authorities if the Company’s net operating loss carryovers from those prior years are utilized in the future. We are\ncurrently under examination by certain state taxing authorities. We do not expect any settlement or payment that may result\nfrom the examination to have a material effect on our results or cash flows.\nOur effective tax rate was 22.1% and 15.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 20.7%\nand 16.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On July 10, 2023, we entered into a\ndefinitive agreement to sell our Washington operations and the transaction closed on May 1, 2024. As a result, we recorded an\nincrease to our current tax expense of $2.4 million and $8.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $3.6 million and $17.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,\nrelated to the write-down of noncash goodwill included in the transaction that is not deductible for tax purposes. The\nCompany does not consider this sales transaction and related goodwill adjustments unusual or infrequent and therefore the\ncorresponding tax impact is recorded through continuing operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we\nrecorded $4.4 million of tax expense to adjust our 2022 provision to match our 2022 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments,\nour effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would have been approximately 25.8% and\n26.0%, respectively, and approximately 25.5% and 25.6% for the nine months ended\n22\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates\ndue to various permanent income tax differences.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation, Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies\nGross Receipts Tax\nTwo of our subsidiaries, Consolidated Communications of Pennsylvania Company LLC (“CCPA”) and Consolidated\nCommunications Enterprise Services, Inc. (“CCES”), have, at various times, received Assessment Notices and/or Audit\nAssessment Notices from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (“DOR”) increasing the amounts owed\nfor the Pennsylvania Gross Receipts Tax, and have had audits performed for the tax years 2008 through 2018 (CCPA and\nCCES) and 2019 through 2020 (CCPA). We filed Petitions for Reassessment with the DOR’s Board of Appeals contesting\nthese audit assessments. These cases remain pending and are in various stages of appeal. In May 2017, we entered into an\nagreement to guarantee any potential liabilities to the DOR up to $5.0 million.\nTax liabilities calculated by the DOR for CCPA and CCES for tax years 2010 (CCPA) and 2014 through 2023 (CCPA and\nCCES) are approximately $5.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Based on the initial settlement offers for the tax years\n2008 through 2013, which were subsequently settled in 2019 for $2.1 million, including interest, and the Company’s best\nestimate of the potential additional tax liabilities for the remaining unsettled tax years 2010 (CCPA) and 2014 through 2023\n(CCPA and CCES), we have reserved $1.0 million and $2.7 million, including interest, for our CCPA and CCES subsidiaries,\nrespectively. We expect the filings for the tax years 2014 through 2023 to be settled at a later date similar to the initial\nsettlement. While we continue to believe a settlement of all remaining disputed claims is possible, we cannot anticipate at this\ntime what the ultimate resolution of these cases will be, nor can we evaluate the likelihood of a favorable or unfavorable\noutcome or the potential losses (or gains) should such an outcome occur.\nFrom time to time we may be involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies in our industry,\nincluding regulatory issues. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the\noutcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\n23\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.

Many of\nthese circumstances are beyond our ability to control or predict. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons\nacting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements that appear throughout this report.\nFurthermore, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which are based on the information\ncurrently available to us and speak only as of the date they are made.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”) as of and for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to certain measures that are not measures of financial performance in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”). We believe the use of these non-\nGAAP measures on a consolidated basis provides the reader with additional information that is useful in understanding\n24\nTable of Contents\nour operating results and trends. These measures should be viewed in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, those\nmeasures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a more detailed discussion on\nthe use and calculation of these measures.\nOverview\nConsolidated is a broadband and business communications provider offering a wide range of communication solutions to\nconsumer, commercial and carrier customers across a service area in over 20 states. We operate an advanced fiber network\nspanning nearly 66,000 fiber route miles across many rural areas and metro communities. We offer residential high-speed\nInternet, phone and home security services as well as multi-service residential and small business bundles. Our business\nproduct suite includes: data and Internet solutions, voice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and\nan expanded suite of cloud services. We provide wholesale solutions to wireless and wireline carriers and other service\nproviders including data, voice, network connections and custom fiber builds and last mile connections.\nWe generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from monthly subscriptions to our broadband, data\nand transport services (collectively “broadband services”) marketed to residential and business customers. As consumer\ndemands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and upgrading data\nspeeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. Our investment in more competitive broadband speeds is critical to\nour long-term success. Our strategic investment with Searchlight Capital Partners L.P. (“Searchlight”) combined with the\nrefinancing of our capital structure in 2020 provided us with additional capital that has enabled us to accelerate our fiber\nexpansion plans and provided significant benefits to our consumer, commercial and carrier customers. With this strategic\ninvestment, we enhanced our fiber infrastructure and accelerated our investments in high-growth and competitive areas. By\nleveraging our existing dense core fiber network and an accelerated build plan, we expect to be able to significantly increase\ndata speeds, expand our multi-Gig coverage and strategically extend our network across our strong existing commercial and\ncarrier footprint to attract more on-net and near-net opportunities. As part of our multi-year fiber expansion plan, we plan to\nupgrade approximately 1.6 million passings to fiber across select service areas to enable multi-Gig capable services to these\nhomes and small businesses including more than 1 million passings within our northern New England service areas. The\nultimate total passings will be dependent upon, amongst other things, our ability to secure Public Private Partnership grant\narrangements and other broadband infrastructure funding opportunities.\nIn 2024, we plan to continue to execute on our multi-year fiber growth plan and transformation from a copper-based\ntelecommunications provider to a fiber broadband provider. Our fiber build plan includes the upgrade of approximately\n150,000 homes and small businesses in 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we upgraded\napproximately 58,000 and 101,700 passings, respectively and added approximately 18,500 and 55,000 consumer fiber Gig-\ncapable subscribers, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we upgraded approximately 227,500 passings.\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 51% of our passings were at least 1 Gig capable, as compared to 22% at December\n31, 2021.\nFidium Fiber, our Gigabit consumer fiber internet product with an all-new customer experience reinforces our broadband-first\nstrategy. Our Fidium plans offer symmetrical speeds up to 2 Gbps over the latest WiFi 6 technology with no data caps. We\nexpect to continue to expand the availability of Fidium Fiber further into communities within our markets. In February 2023,\nwe launched Fidium@Work and expanded our Fidium Fiber service to small businesses everywhere Fidium internet is\navailable. Fidium@Work is ideal for small businesses that have outgrown residential or traditional internet service, but do not\nrequire an enterprise solution.\nAs we continue to increase broadband speeds, we believe that we will also be able to simultaneously enhance our commercial\nproduct offerings to meet the needs of our business customers. By leveraging our advanced fiber network, we can tailor our\nservices for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We offer fiber broadband connectivity and\ncloud-based services to deliver differentiated solutions targeting customers ranging from small businesses to large enterprises\nand carriers. We are focused on driving fiber connectivity, achieving data services growth and standardizing our commercial\nproduct portfolio, which increases efficiency and enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOperating revenues continue to be impacted by the industry-wide trend of declines in voice services, access lines and related\nnetwork access revenue. Many customers are choosing to subscribe to alternative communication services, and competition\nfor these subscribers continues to increase. Total voice connections decreased 15% as of September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023. We have been able to mitigate some of the access line losses through alternative product offerings, such\nas our VoIP service.\nAs part of our plan to simplify our product offerings and focus on our fiber-first strategy, video services have been\ndiscontinued in all markets as of the end of July 2024 as a result of our scheduled decommissioning by state and the transition\nof customers to streaming services offered through our streaming partnerships. We believe that this may amplify the demand\nfor our competitive multi-gig broadband speeds to facilitate streaming content.\nIn July 2023, we initiated a business simplification and cost savings initiative plan intended to further align our company as a\nfiber-first provider, improve operating efficiencies, lower our cost structure and ultimately improve the overall customer\nexperience. This initiative included a reduction in workforce, consolidation and elimination of certain facilities and review of\nour product offerings. In 2024, we expect to continue to seek to improve operating efficiency through technology, better\npractices and procedures and through cost containment measures, and initiated a plan during the quarter ended September 30,\n2024 to further reduce our workforce. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized severance\ncosts of $10.4 million and $16.2 million, respectively, in connection with the plans.\nRecent Developments\nMerger Agreement\nOn October 15, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Condor Holdings\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”) affiliated with certain funds managed by affiliates of Searchlight, and\nCondor Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which,\nsubject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the\nCompany continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Searchlight. British\nColumbia Investment Management Corporation (“BCI”) and certain affiliates of Searchlight have committed to provide equity\nfinancing to Parent to fund the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Searchlight is currently the beneficial\nowner of approximately 33% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and is the holder of 100% of the\nCompany’s outstanding Series A perpetual preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share\n(other than shares of the Company’s common stock (i) held directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of\nthe Company, (ii) held by the Company as treasury shares or (iii) held by any person who properly exercises appraisal rights\nunder Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $4.70 per share, without interest\n(the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. In addition, pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, (i) Company restricted share awards (“Company RSAs”) held by\nnon-employee directors or by certain affiliates of Searchlight will vest and be canceled in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration and (ii) all other Company RSAs will be converted into restricted cash awards based on the Merger\nConsideration and subject to the same terms and conditions, including time- and performance-based vesting conditions, as the\ncorresponding Company RSA (except that the relative total shareholder return modifier shall be deemed to be achieved at the\ntarget level).\nThe Merger Agreement has, unanimously by the directors present, been approved by the board of directors of the Company\n(the “Board”), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee consisting of only independent and\ndisinterested directors of the Company (the “Special Committee”). On January 31, 2024, the Company held a virtual special\nmeeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) to consider three proposals with respect to the Merger Agreement. The first\nproposal, to adopt the Merger Agreement, was approved by (i) holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the\nissued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and (ii) holders of a majority of the\nvoting power represented by the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and\nheld by Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The second proposal, to approve by advisory (non-\nbinding) vote the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in\nconnection with the consummation of the Merger, was approved by the requisite vote of the\n26\nTable of Contents\nCompany’s stockholders. The third proposal, to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit\nadditional proxies if there were insufficient votes in favor of the Merger Agreement proposal, was also approved by the\nrequisite vote of the Company’s stockholders. Because the Merger Agreement proposal was approved by the requisite vote, no\nadjournment to solicit additional proxies was necessary.\nThe proposed transaction constitutes a “going-private transaction” under the rules of the SEC and is expected to close in late\nfourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025. The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i) the\nexpiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”); (ii) the receipt of certain required consents or approvals from (a) the\nFederal Communications Commission, (b) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (c) state public utility\ncommissions and (d) local regulators in connection with the provision of telecommunications and media services; (iii) the\nabsence of any order, injunction or decree restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation\nof the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations\nand warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, as of the date of the\nMerger Agreement and the date of closing, and performance in all material respects of the covenants and agreements contained\nin the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The waiting period under the HSR Act\nexpired on May 9, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. This satisfied the closing condition related to the U.S. antitrust clearance of the\ntransaction. We are awaiting the other required regulatory approvals in order to execute the Merger. Following the closing of\nthe transaction, shares of our common stock will no longer be traded or listed on any public securities exchange.\nAdditional information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger is set forth in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement\non Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on December 18, 2023, as supplemented.\nDivestiture\nOn July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our business located in the Washington market (the\n“Washington operations”), for gross cash proceeds of approximately $73.0 million, subject to customary working capital\nadjustments and other post-closing purchase price adjustments. At December 31, 2023, the assets and liabilities to be sold\nwere classified as assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, in connection with the expected sale, the carrying value of the net assets to be sold were reduced to their estimated\nfair value, which was determined based on the estimated selling price less costs to sell. As a result, we recognized an\nimpairment loss of $77.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The sale of the Washington operations\nclosed on May 1, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an additional loss on the sale of\n$0.5 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of\noperations as a result of changes in estimated working capital adjustments and selling costs. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, operating revenues for the Washington operations were $5.0 million or 1.8% of total consolidated\noperating revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating revenues for the Washington\noperations were $6.3 million or 0.8% and $15.1 million or 1.8% of total consolidated operating revenues, respectively.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables reflect our financial results on a consolidated basis and key operating metrics as of and for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFinancial Data\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n$ % $ %\n(In millions, except for percentages) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change\nOperating Revenues\nConsumer:\nBroadband (Data and VoIP) $ 82.4 $ 75.1 $ 7.3 10% $ 243.7 $ 214.4 $ 29.3 14%\nVoice services 27.9 31.6 (3.7) (12) 84.2 95.2 (11.0) (12)\nVideo services — 8.5 (8.5) (100) 9.9 27.5 (17.6) (64)\n110.3 115.2 (4.9) (4) 337.8 337.1 0.7 0\nCommercial:\nData services (includes VoIP) 54.6 53.8 0.8 1 163.9 160.2 3.7 2\nVoice services 31.5 31.8 (0.3) (1) 92.7 96.7 (4.0) (4)\nOther 9.4 9.3 0.1 1 26.7 29.4 (2.7) (9)\n95.5 94.9 0.6 1 283.3 286.3 (3.0) (1)\nCarrier:\nData and transport services 30.4 31.4 (1.0) (3) 91.7 95.5 (3.8) (4)\nVoice services 3.4 4.1 (0.7) (17) 10.8 12.7 (1.9) (15)\nOther 0.3 0.3 — — 0.8 1.0 (0.2) (20)\n34.1 35.8 (1.7) (5) 103.3 109.2 (5.9) (5)\nSubsidies 5.9 6.9 (1.0) (14) 19.1 21.0 (1.9) (9)\nNetwork access 22.0 20.8 1.2 6 65.6 68.0 (2.4) (4)\nOther products and services 3.3 10.0 (6.7) (67) 5.4 13.3 (7.9) (59)\nTotal operating revenues 271.1 283.6 (12.5) (4) 814.5 834.9 (20.4) (2)\nOperating Expenses\nCost of services and products\n(exclusive of depreciation and\namortization) 113.2 132.4 (19.2) (15) 340.7 391.3 (50.6) (13)\nSelling, general and\nadministrative costs 98.6 95.7 2.9 3 275.9 259.6 16.3 6\nTransaction costs 0.6 1.1 (0.5) (45) 6.7 2.0 4.7 235\nLoss on impairment of assets\nheld for sale — — — — — 77.8 (77.8) (100)\nLoss on disposal of assets — 6.7 (6.7) (100) — 12.4 (12.4) (100)\nDepreciation and amortization 76.7 79.6 (2.9) (4) 237.1 236.8 0.3 0\nTotal operating expenses 289.1 315.5 (26.4) (8) 860.4 979.9 (119.5) (12)\nLoss from operations (18.0) (31.9) (13.9) (44) (45.9) (145.0) (99.1) (68)\nInterest expense, net (44.9) (39.6) 5.3 13 (131.5) (110.4) 21.1 19\nOther income, net 0.1 3.5 (3.4) (97) 2.0 11.7 (9.7) (83)\nIncome tax benefit (13.8) (10.2) 3.6 35 (36.2) (40.9) (4.7) (11)\nNet loss (49.0) (57.8) (8.8) (15) (139.2) (202.8) (63.6) (31)\nDividends on Series A preferred\nstock 12.3 11.3 1.0 9 35.7 32.6 3.1 10\nNet income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 — — 0.3 0.4 (0.1) (25)\nLoss attributable to common\nshareholders $ (61.4) $ (69.2) $ (7.8) (11) $ (175.2) $ (235.8) $ (60.6) (26)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $ 86.5 $ 80.2 $ 6.3 8% $ 259.1 $ 232.5 $ 26.6 11%\n(1) A non-GAAP measure.

We offer high-speed Internet access at speeds of up to 2 Gbps, depending on the network facilities that are\navailable, the level of service selected and the location. Our fiber expansion plan is expected to provide fiber broadband\nrevenue growth opportunities as we upgrade data speeds and expand our multi-Gig coverage across our network. Our VoIP\ndigital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line.\nBroadband services revenues increased $7.3 million and $29.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The change in broadband services revenue was reduced in part by\nthe sale of the Washington operations in 2024, which resulted in a decrease of broadband services revenues of $2.0 million and\n$3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively. Broadband services revenue continued to increase primarily as a result of price increases and growth in\nfiber Internet services as fiber data connections continue to increase and offset the decline in copper data connections. Total\nconsumer data connections increased 3% as of September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In addition, a\ngreater mix of our subscribers are shifting towards higher broadband speeds and electing to subscribe to our 1 Gig or higher\nproduct.\nVoice Services\nWe offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate\ncalling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and\ncall waiting. Voice services revenues decreased $3.7 million and $11.0 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in access lines. In addition,\nthe sale of our Washington operations in 2024 accounted for $0.8 million and $1.4 million of the decrease during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring\nrevenues we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to\ncontinue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies.\n29\nTable of Contents\nVideo Services\nDepending on geographic market availability, our video services historically ranged from limited basic service to advanced\ndigital television, which included several plans, each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium\nand Pay-Per-View channels as well as video On-Demand service. Certain customers could have also subscribed to our\nadvanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (“DVR”) and/or a whole home\nDVR. Our video subscribers could also watch their favorite shows, movies and livestreams on any device. In addition, we\noffered other on-demand streaming TV services, which provided endless entertainment options. In 2024, we commenced a\nscheduled decommissioning of video services across all our markets. Video services have been discontinued in all markets as\nof the end of July 2024 as part of our plan to simplify our product offerings and focus on our fiber-first strategy.\nVideo services revenues decreased $8.5 million and $17.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the planned discontinuance of video services in our\nmarkets and the transition of customers to streaming services offered through our streaming partnerships.\nCommercial\nData Services\nWe provide a variety of business communication services to business customers of all sizes, including voice and data services\nover our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high-speed broadband Internet access and VoIP\nphone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we\nalso offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including Ethernet services; private line data\nservices; software defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”) and multi-protocol label switching. Our networking services\ninclude point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our\nbusiness customers. We offer a suite of cloud-based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that\nreplaces the customer’s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection\nservices. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers.\nData services revenues increased $0.8 million and $3.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to continued growth in dedicated Internet access and fiber Internet\nservices, which was reduced in part by declines in Metro Ethernet and VoIP phone services as a result of customer churn. In\nrecent years, the growth in data services revenues has been impacted by customer churn from increased competition and price\ncompression as customers are migrating from legacy data connection products to more competitive products with a lower\naverage revenue per user.\nVoice Services\nVoice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options\nfor voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call\nforwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled\nwith selected services at a discounted rate. Voice services revenues decreased $0.3 million and $4.0 million during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in\naccess lines as commercial customers are increasingly choosing alternative technologies and the broad range of features that\nInternet-based voice services can offer.\nOther\nOther services include business equipment sales and related hardware and maintenance support, video services, pole\nattachment fees and other miscellaneous revenues, including 911 service revenues. Other services revenues increased $0.1\nmillion and decreased $2.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the\nsame periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in custom construction and structured cabling revenues. Pole license\n30\nTable of Contents\nattachment fees also decreased following the sale in 2023 of poles located in New Hampshire and video services decreased\nfrom the discontinuance of video services in our markets in 2024. However, these declines were offset in part by an increase in\nbusiness equipment sales.\nCarrier\nData and Transport Services\nWe provide high-speed fiber data transmission services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers including\nEthernet, cellular backhaul, dark fiber and colocation services. Data and transport services revenues decreased $1.0 million\nand $3.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in\n2023 due to a decrease in Ethernet services as a result of customer churn. Colocation and cellular backhaul revenue also\ndeclined from the same periods in 2023 as a result of a reduction in pricing of recent contract renewals with our wireless\nbackhaul partners. We expect to recognize further declines in cellular backhaul revenue as a result of the new pricing in 2024.\nVoice Services\nWe provide basic local phone service packages with customized features for resell by wholesale customers. The plans include\noptions for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features. Voice services\nrevenues decreased $0.7 million and $1.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of customer churn for business data services.\nSubsidies\nSubsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality broadband\nservices at affordable prices with higher data speeds in rural areas. Subsidies revenues decreased $1.0 million and $1.9\nmillion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023\nprimarily due to changes in state subsidies support and the sale of the Washington operations in May 2024. See the\n“Regulatory Matters” section below for a further discussion of the subsidies we receive.\nNetwork Access Services\nNetwork access services include interstate and intrastate switched access, network special access and end user\naccess. Switched access revenues include access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-\ndistance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and\ninterexchange carriers. Network access services revenues increased $1.2 million and decreased $2.4 million during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Special access revenues\ncontinue to be impacted by declines in minutes of use, voice connections and carrier circuits as carriers transition to Ethernet\nbased transport solutions; however, the decline was reduced in part by price increases implemented during the three months\nended September 30, 2024. End user access revenue increased $0.8 million and decreased $0.8 million during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of quarterly changes in Federal and State Universal Service\nFund (“USF”) contribution factors in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nOther Products and Services\nOther products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising, billing and support\nservices and other miscellaneous revenues, including revenue from Public Private Partnerships (“PPP’s”). We have entered\ninto numerous PPP agreements with various towns in New Hampshire and Vermont to build new fiber to the premise\n(“FTTP”) Internet networks. The new town networks provide multi-gigabit broadband speeds to residential and commercial\ncustomers. PPP’s are a key component of Consolidated’s commitment to expand rural broadband access.\nOther products and services revenues decreased $6.7 million and $7.9 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in revenue from PPP\nconstruction projects. Directory advertising revenue also declined from the prior year periods.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Services and Products\nCost of services and products decreased $19.2 million and $50.6 million during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Video programming costs decreased as a result of a decline in\nvideo connections and the planned decommissioning of video services in 2024. Access expense also decreased from the prior\nyear periods as a result of additional fiber costs for PPP construction agreements related to construction projects in 2023, as\ndescribed above. Contract labor costs declined from savings in maintenance costs. Employee labor costs decreased as a result\nof a reduction in head count and the cost savings initiative plan implemented in 2023. Required contributions to the State USF\ndecreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a reduction in the funding rates for Texas as compared\nto 2023. In addition, Federal USF contributions declined due to a one-time adjustment recognized during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 for the final filings for 2023 as well as lower assessable revenues in 2024.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $2.9 million and $16.3 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Professional fees increased during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 for various system enhancements, customer service improvements and strategic initiatives.\nHowever, the increase was reduced in part by an overall decline in severance costs incurred in 2024 and 2023. During each of\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we initiated a business simplification and cost savings initiative plan\nintended to further align our company as a fiber-first provider, improve operating efficiencies, lower our cost structure and\nultimately improve the overall customer experience. In connection with the cost savings initiative plans and reduction in\nworkforce, we recognized severance costs of $10.4 million and $16.2 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and $15.2 million and $19.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs of $0.6 million and $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand $6.7 million and $2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consist primarily\nof legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement entered into with Searchlight in\nOctober 2023.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an additional loss of $2.6 million and $4.7\nmillion, respectively, on the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Kansas City operations as a result of purchase price\nadjustments and working capital changes. We also recognized a loss of $0.5 million and $4.1 million related to the sale of\ncertain utility poles during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a loss of $3.6 million on the disposal of certain equipment and\ninventory.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.9 million and increased $0.3 million during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures\nrelated to the fiber network expansion and customer service improvements as well as success-based capital projects for\nconsumer and commercial services. However, depreciation expense declined during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Amortization expense also declined during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 for customer relationships, which are amortized under the accelerated method.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Matters\nOur revenues are subject to broad federal and/or state regulations, which include such telecommunications services as local\ntelephone service, network access service and toll service. The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal,\nstate and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, federal and state regulators share responsibility for\nimplementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely\navailable, quality telephone service at affordable prices.\nAt the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our\nrural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international\ncommunications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for\nfailure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed\nfor any of these violations.\nState regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers’ facilities and services to the extent they are used to\nprovide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight\nover interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and\nother local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators\ncan sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations.\nFCC Matters\nIn general, telecommunications service in rural areas is costlier to provide than service in urban areas. The lower customer\ndensity means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater\nexpenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high-cost of operations in rural markets, USF subsidies\npromote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas.\nIn April 2019, the FCC announced plans for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), the next phase of the Connect\nAmerica Fund (“CAF”) program. The RDOF is a $20.4 billion fund to bring speeds of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps\nupstream to unserved and underserved areas of America. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking at their August\n2019 Open Commission Meeting. The order prioritizes terrestrial broadband as a bridge to rural 5G networks by providing a\nsignificant weight advantage to traditional broadband providers. Funding will occur in two phases with the first phase\nauctioning $16.0 billion and the second phase auctioning $4.4 billion, each to be distributed over 10 years. The minimum\nspeed required to receive funding is 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream. Consolidated won 246 census block groups\nserving in seven states in the 2020 auction. The bids we won are at the 1 Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream speed tier\nto approximately 27,000 locations at an annual funding level of $5.9 million as of January 1, 2022 through December 31,\n2031. Consolidated began receiving RDOF funding in January 2022.\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act Funding\nPresident Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) on March 11, 2021. States have been allocated\nfederal funds to be utilized for capital infrastructure, including broadband deployment, and are in various stages of\nimplementation. We are working with the states and municipalities to participate in this broadband grant program. In January\n2023, we were awarded $9.2 million in funding from ARPA to build to approximately 14,000 unserved homes in Skowhegan\nand Greater East Grand Bay, Maine and in February 2023, we were awarded $40.0 million in funding from ARPA to build\nnearly 25,000 unserved homes throughout New Hampshire. Construction began for both projects in 2023 and is expected to be\nlargely completed by the end of 2024. The grants will be accounted for as a contribution in aid of construction given the nature\nof the arrangement.\nAffordable Connectivity Program\nThe Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”) is a broadband affordability program set up to help ensure that households can\nafford the broadband access they need for work, school, healthcare and more. The benefit provides a discount of up to\n33\nTable of Contents\n$30 per month toward internet service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal\nlands. Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or\ntablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price. The ACP is\nlimited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per household. The program began distributing funds on\nMarch 1, 2022. Due to the expected lapse in the initial funding for the ACP in the second quarter of 2024, the ACP stopped\naccepting new applications and enrollments on February 7, 2024. The last fully funded month of the program was April 2024.\nConsolidated participated in this program and had approximately 8,300 ACP customers prior to the termination of the\nprogram.\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“Infrastructure Act”), signed on November 15, 2021, included $65.0 billion to\nsupport broadband infrastructure deployment and access across the United States with an aim to extend high-speed broadband\nconnectivity to unserved rural, low-income, and tribal communities, as well as to promote broadband affordability and digital\nliteracy. Among other broadband-related initiatives, the Infrastructure Act allocated $42.5 billion for the Broadband Equity,\nAccess, and Deployment (“BEAD”) program, which is administered by the National Telecommunications and Information\nAdministration (“NTIA”). The NTIA has begun distributing BEAD program funding to states, which, in turn, will award\nBEAD program grants to ISPs to support broadband deployment and access initiatives. The precise terms under which BEAD\nprogram grants will be awarded to ISPs are expected to vary from state to state and are not known at this time.\nApart from the broadband funding initiatives in the Infrastructure Act, Congress directed the FCC to adopt rules prohibiting\n“digital discrimination of access,” and the FCC in turn issued an order in November 2023 defining that term broadly. In\nparticular, the FCC prohibited any policy or practice by ISPs, among other covered entities, that intentionally discriminates or\nhas a disparate impact based on race, income level, and other prohibited classifications. The FCC indicated that it intends to\ntake enforcement action based on any finding of digital discrimination unless the ISP can show that the policy or practice in\nquestion was justified based on economic or technical feasibility. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several groups\nrepresenting ISPs filed petitions for review challenging the FCC’s order, and the petitions have been consolidated in the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. At this time, we cannot determine the likely impacts of the FCC’s order or the\noutcome of the pending appeal.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nWe are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material\nimpact on our operations. The FCC and state commissions have authority to conduct audits and issue and interpret rules and\nregulations related to our business and federal courts have the authority to interpret the constitutionality of regulatory\nprograms that impact our business. A number of proceedings and findings are pending or anticipated that are related to such\ntelecommunications issues as competition, interconnection, access charges, ICC, broadband deployment, rural subsidy\nprograms, consumer protection and universal service reform. Some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with\nour existing services. Proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes, carriage\nof programming, industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition. There are various on-going legal\nchallenges to the scope or validity of FCC orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to fully determine the\nimpact of the related FCC rules and regulations on our operations.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased $5.3 million and $21.1 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to additional interest on borrowings\nfrom the revolving credit facility as a result of outstanding borrowings of $200.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and an\nincrease in variable interest rates on our outstanding term loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest\nexpense also increased from a decline in interest income of $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ndue to additional cash equivalents and short-term investments in 2023.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOther Income\nOther income decreased $3.4 million and $9.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in investment income of $1.8 million and $4.2\nmillion, respectively, as a result of earnings from short-term investments in 2023. Pension and post-retirement expense\nincreased $1.2 million and $3.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 13\nto the condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and post-retirement\nplans.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit increased $3.6 million and decreased $4.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 22.1% and 15.0% for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 20.7% and 16.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. On July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Washington operations and the\ntransaction closed on May 1, 2024. As a result, we recorded an increase to our current tax expense of $2.4 million and $8.5\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $3.6 million and $17.7 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the write-down of noncash goodwill included in the\ntransaction that is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company does not consider this sales transaction and related goodwill\nadjustments unusual or infrequent and therefore the corresponding tax impact is recorded through continuing operations.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded $4.4 million of tax expense to adjust our 2022 provision to\nmatch our 2022 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 would have been approximately 25.8% and 26.0%, respectively and approximately 25.5% and 25.6% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the effective tax rate differed from the federal and state\nstatutory rates due to various permanent income tax differences.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends.\nThese financial measures are not measures of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a\nmeasure of liquidity. They are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in\naccordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nused by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures\npresented in accordance with GAAP are provided below.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted\nEBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required under our credit facility as described in\nthe reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications\nindustry and we believe they are useful, with other data, as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (48,972) $ (57,720) $ (139,183) $ (202,773)\nAdd (subtract):\nInterest expense, net of interest income 44,894 39,571 131,477 110,334\nIncome tax benefit (13,879) (10,220) (36,232) (40,908)\nDepreciation and amortization 76,693 79,604 237,135 236,841\nEBITDA 58,736 51,235 193,197 103,494\nAdjustments to EBITDA:\nOther, net (1) 25,163 20,043 58,630 33,442\nLoss on disposal of assets — 6,692 — 12,380\nLoss on impairment — — — 77,755\nNon-cash, stock-based compensation 2,638 2,261 7,349 5,448\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 86,537 $ 80,231 $ 259,176 $ 232,519\n(1) Includes dividend income, income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, acquisition and transaction\nrelated costs including integration and severance, non-cash pension and post-retirement benefits and certain other\nmiscellaneous items.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOutlook and Overview\nOur operating requirements have historically been funded from cash flows generated from our business and borrowings under\nour credit facilities. We expect that our future operating requirements will continue to be funded from cash flows from\noperating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets and borrowings under our\nrevolving credit facility or other funding arrangements and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that\nwe will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures for our accelerated fiber network\nexpansion and growth plan.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 36,103 $ 102,593\nInvesting activities (221,798) (326,485)\nFinancing activities 225,328 (12,343)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ 39,633 $ (236,235)\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $36.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of\n$66.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a\ndecline in accounts payable and accrued expense related to the timing of expenditures. Cash flows provided by operating\nactivities also declined related to the timing of cash receipts for special projects and grant funding. Cash paid for interest also\nincreased $13.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $221.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted\nprimarily of cash used for capital expenditures and proceeds received from the sale of assets and investments.\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were $290.3 million and $424.2 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be\nused for our planned fiber projects and broadband network expansion, including the upgrade in 2024 of approximately\n150,000 fiber passings, and to support success-based capital projects for commercial, carrier and consumer initiatives. We\nexpect to continue to invest in the enhancement and expansion of our fiber network in order to retain and acquire more\ncustomers through a broader set of products and an expanded network footprint.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding stock of our\nWashington operations for cash proceeds, net of selling costs, of $67.8 million.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from and principal payments on long-term borrowings.\nLong-term Debt\nCredit Agreement\nOn October 2, 2020, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Credit Agreement with\nvarious financial institutions (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) to replace the Company’s previous credit agreement in its\nentirety. The Credit Agreement consisted of term loans in an original aggregate amount of $1,250.0 million (the “Term\nLoans”) and a revolving loan facility of $250.0 million. The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental loan facility which\nprovides the ability to borrow, subject to certain terms and conditions, incremental loans in an aggregate amount of up to the\ngreater of (a) $300.0 million plus (b) an amount which would not cause its senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed\n3.70:1.00 (the “Incremental Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of\nthe Company and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loans have a maturity date of October 2, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of 3.50% plus Secured Overnight\nBorrowing Rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a 0.75% SOFR floor) plus a SOFR adjustment. As part of the replacement to SOFR-\nbenchmark rates in 2023, borrowings will include an adjustment of 0.11%, 0.26% and 0.43% for borrowings of one, three and\nsix month loans, respectively. On March 18, 2021, the Company repaid $397.0 million of the then outstanding Term Loans\nwith the net proceeds received from the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior secured notes\ndue 2028 (the “5.00% Senior Notes”), as described below. The repayment of the Term Loans was applied to the remaining\nprincipal payments in direct order of maturity, thereby eliminating the required quarterly principal payments through the\nremaining term of the loan.\nThe revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 2, 2027 (subject to springing maturity on April 2, 2027 if the Term\nLoans, as of April 1, 2027, are scheduled to mature earlier than March 31, 2028) and an applicable margin (at our election) of\n4.00% for SOFR-based borrowings or 3.00% for alternate base rate borrowings, with a 0.25% reduction in each case if the\nconsolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, does not exceed 3.20 to 1.00. As of September 30,\n2024, borrowings of $200.0 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2023, there were no\nborrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Stand-by letters of credit of $46.7 million were outstanding under\nour revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. The stand-by letters of credit are renewable annually and reduce the\nborrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, $3.3 million was available for borrowing\nunder the revolving credit facility, subject to certain covenants. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of $212.0 million and\nstand-by letters of credit of $35.4 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 8.89% and 8.96% as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nCredit Agreement Covenant Compliance\nThe Credit Agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to\npay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue certain capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial\nratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Among other things, it\nwill be an event of default, with respect to the revolving credit facility only, if our consolidated first lien leverage ratio is\ngreater than 7.75:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, if on such date the testing threshold is met. The testing threshold is\nmet if the aggregate amount of our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceeds 35%. As of September\n30, 2024, the testing threshold was met and our consolidated first lien leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement was below\n7.75:1.00. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants.\nOn October 15, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) to,\namong other things, increase the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (the “Step-Up”) permitted under the Credit\nAgreement to (i) 7.75 to 1.00, from October 15, 2023 to and including December 31, 2024, (ii) 7.50 to 1.00, from and\nincluding January 1, 2025 to and including March 31, 2025, (iii) 7.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2025 to and\nincluding June 30, 2025, (iv) 7.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2025 to and including September 30, 2025, (v) 6.75 to\n1.00 from and including October 1, 2025 to and including December 31, 2025, (vi) 6.50 to 1.00, from and including January 1,\n2026 to and including March 31, 2026, (vii) 6.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2026 to and including June 30, 2026,\n(viii) 6.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2026 to and including September 30, 2026, and (ix) 5.85 to 1.00 from and\nincluding October 1, 2026 and thereafter (the “Step-Up Period”). While the Step-Up is in effect, the Company will be subject\nto additional restrictions on its ability to make certain investments and restricted payments (the “Restrictions”). The Step-Up\nPeriod and the Restrictions will end and the maximum Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio will revert to the levels set\nforth in the Credit Agreement on the earlier of (a) the Company’s election and (b) August 1, 2025, to the extent $300.0 million\nin cash proceeds have not been received by the Company from equity contributed to its capital by such date. If the proposed\nMerger is not completed by August 1, 2025, the increase in the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio as permitted in\nthe Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to provide interim financial covenant relief will end and the maximum\nconsolidated first lien leverage ratio will revert to 5.85 to 1.00.\nFiber Broadband Term Loans\nOn August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, the Company entered into loan agreements (the “Loan Agreements”), pursuant to\nwhich the Company may borrow up to an aggregate amount of $80.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, in delayed draw\nterm loans to fund further development and construction of fiber infrastructure. Outstanding borrowings under the Loan\nAgreements will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum, payable semi-annually. The term of the loans is four years\nfrom the initial advance with an option to extend the maturity by two one-year periods, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nThe borrowings are senior secured obligations of the Company and the Loan Agreements contain negative covenants\nsubstantively similar to the existing Credit Agreement and other covenants customary for facilities of this type. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, borrowings of $43.8 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreement entered into on August 28,\n2024. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of $51.8 million and $5.6 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreements\nentered into on August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, respectively.\nSearchlight Term Loan\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and Searchlight, as lender entered into a\nTerm Loan Agreement (the “Searchlight Loan Agreement”), which consists of delayed draw term loans in the aggregate\namount of $80.0 million (the “Loan”). The Searchlight Loan Agreement provides us with the ability to borrow on the Loan in\nthe event either (a) the aggregate amount of available loans to be drawn under the revolving credit facility is less than $25.0\nmillion or (b) drawing under the revolving credit facility would trigger the financial maintenance covenant thereunder and we\nwould not be in compliance with such covenant on a pro forma basis, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain other\ncustomary conditions.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIn the event the Loan is ever drawn, we intend to apply the proceeds from the Loan to directly or indirectly fund capital\nexpenditures for our fiber broadband expansion plan. The Searchlight Loan Agreement is unsecured and the Loan will mature\non April 2, 2027. Drawn amounts on the Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable rate ranging from 12.0%\nper annum, which applies prior to the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date (unless the Merger Agreement is\nterminated pursuant to the Company’s breach thereof), to the amount required for Searchlight to realize a multiple on invested\ncapital of 1.75x on the Loan, which applies on and after the earlier of (i) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated\npursuant to the Company’s breach thereof and (ii) the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date.\nThe Searchlight Loan Agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants consistent with the\nCompany’s existing credit agreement. The Loan Agreement requires, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated and any\namounts in respect of the Loan remain outstanding, for the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated first lien leverage\nratio. The Searchlight Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, nonpayment,\nmaterial inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violations of covenants, nonpayment of other material debts, certain\nbankruptcy and liquidations, certain material judgments, and certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974, as amended.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 2, 2020, we completed an offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% unsubordinated secured\nnotes due 2028 (the “6.50% Senior Notes”). The 6.50% Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 6.50%,\npayable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2028.\nOn March 18, 2021, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount 5.00% Senior Notes, together with the 6.50% Senior\nNotes (the “Senior Notes”). The 5.00% Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable\nsemi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 5.00% Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2028. The net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of the 5.00% Senior Notes were used to repay $397.0 million of the Term Loans outstanding under the\nCredit Agreement.\nThe Senior Notes are unsubordinated secured obligations of the Company, secured by a first priority lien on the collateral that\nsecures the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on\na first priority secured basis by the Company and the majority of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The offerings of the Senior\nNotes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any state securities laws.\nSenior Notes Covenant Compliance\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants that,\namong other things, limits the Company and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain\npreferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or\nredeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other\npayments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions\nwith its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indentures also contain customary events of default.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under the indentures\ngoverning the Senior Notes.\nFinance Leases\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various finance leases which expire between 2024 and 2040. As of September\n30, 2024, the present value of the minimum remaining lease commitments was approximately $40.4 million, of which $20.6\nmillion was due and payable within the next twelve months. The leases require total remaining rental payments of $45.6\nmillion as of September 30, 2024.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSufficiency of Cash Resources\nThe following table sets forth selected information regarding our financial condition.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands, except for ratio) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 44,398 $ 4,765\nWorking capital (deficit) (79,268) (61,090)\nCurrent ratio 0.76 0.81\nOur net working capital deficit increased $18.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Working\ncapital at December 31, 2023, included net assets classified as held for sale of $67.1 million related to the pending sale of the\nWashington operations, which was completed in the second quarter of 2024. The proceeds from the sale were used in part to\nfund capital expenditures for the fiber build plan in 2024. An increase in accrued interest reduced working capital $18.1\nmillion at September 30, 2024 related to the timing of the semi-annual interest payments for our Senior Notes. Accounts\npayable also increased $9.3 million related to the timing of expenditures. However, cash and cash equivalents increased $40.0\nmillion primarily from the borrowings under the Broadband Loan Agreements during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThe working capital deficit was also reduced by a decline in accrued expense of $23.5 million and an increase in accounts\nreceivable of $18.1 million related to the timing of cash receipts for special projects and grant funding.\nOur most significant use of funds for the remainder of 2024 is expected to be for capital expenditures and interest payments on\nour indebtedness. We have historically funded certain core network capacity equipment with finance leases and it remains our\nintent to continue such arrangements with our leasing partners. In the event we are unable to secure such financing, we may be\nrequired to make cash expenditures for this capital. The refinancing of our capital structure in recent years, including the Fifth\nAmendment to our Credit Agreement described above, availability as of September 30, 2024 of approximately $96.2 million\nand $80.0 million undrawn under the Loan Agreements and the Searchlight Loan Agreement, respectively, provides us with\nnear-term financial and operational flexibility. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses\nof cash and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our\nfinancing arrangements, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After\nthat, our ability to fund expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will\ndepend on the results of future operations, performance, cash flow and potential additional divestitures of non-core assets. Our\nability to fund expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to\nfinancial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nTo the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or\nrequire financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank\nborrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private or public sales of equity\nand debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the\nfuture, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in\namounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing,\nif necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nWe may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other\nborrowing agreements, or are subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making\nintercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and\nprohibitions for the foreseeable future. In addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms\nof indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.\n40\nTable of Contents\nSurety Bonds\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into surety, performance and similar bonds as required by certain jurisdictions in\nwhich we provide services. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $45.7 million of these bonds outstanding.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nAs required, we contribute to qualified defined pension plans and non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (collectively the\n“Pension Plans”) and other post-retirement benefit plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees as\ndescribed in the Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I – Item 1\n“Financial Statements”. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to\ncontribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations.\nThe cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected\nreturn on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plans, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense\nand the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on the Pension Plans assets have historically funded\na significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. We estimate the long-term rate of return on assets will be\n6.50%. The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the\nfinancial markets experience a sustained downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make material\ncontributions to the Pension Plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nOur contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. We elected\nto participate in ARPA beginning with the 2021 plan year. ARPA, which was signed into law in March 2021, included changes\nto the employer funding requirements and is designed to reduce the amounts of required contributions as a relief. During 2021\nand the six months ended June 30, 2022, we elected to fund our pension contributions at the pre-ARPA levels, which has\ncreated a pre-funded balance. We intend to use our current pre-funded balance to satisfy the minimum contribution\nrequirements until the balance is exhausted, which is expected to occur in late 2024. We expect that for 2024, contributions to\nour Pension Plans will be approximately $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have contributed $5.0 million to our\nother post-retirement benefit plans, and expect to make contributions to our other post-retirement benefit plans totaling\napproximately $0.7 million during the remainder of 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nThe timing of cash payments for income taxes, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing\njurisdictions, will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes, which are reported in accordance\nwith GAAP. For example, tax laws in effect regarding accelerated or “bonus” depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less\ncash payments than the GAAP tax expense. Acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash\npayments will exceed GAAP tax expense.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of\naccounting policies. Our judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For a full discussion of our accounting estimates and\nassumptions that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to\n“Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I - Item 1 “Financial\nStatements”.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to market risk is primarily related to the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations. Market risk\nis the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates on our variable rate obligations. In order to manage\nthe volatility relating to changes in interest rates, we utilize derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to\nmaintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our interest rate\nswap agreements effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, thereby reducing the impact of\ninterest rate changes on future cash interest payments. We calculate the potential change in interest expense caused by\nchanges in market interest rates by determining the effect of the hypothetical rate increase on the portion of our variable rate\ndebt that is not subject to a variable rate floor or hedged through the interest rate swap agreements. Based on our variable rate\ndebt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a 1.00% change in market interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest\nexpense by approximately $7.0 million.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file\nor submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nSEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations\nto the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the\ncircumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures\ncan only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving their objectives and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that\nevaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nBased upon the evaluation performed by our management, which was conducted with the participation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting required by Rules\n13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time we may be involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies in our industry,\nincluding regulatory issues. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the\noutcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition or cash flows. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I -\nItem 1 “Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent developments related to these legal proceedings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a level of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described under the heading\n“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K, the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nincluding our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as our other public filings\nwith the SEC, before deciding to invest in our common stock. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk\nfactors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the events described therein could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common\nstock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nInsider Trading Arrangements and Policies\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation\nS-K.\n43\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6.
