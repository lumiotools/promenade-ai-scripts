These forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on current expectations of the respective management of Bigtincan or SPAC and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and may differ materially from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Bigtincan or SPAC. Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted in connection with the Transaction, delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or complete regulatory reviews required to complete the Transaction, the risk that the Transaction disrupts current plans and operations, the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Pubco to grow and manage growth profitably with customers and suppliers and retain key employees, costs related to the Transaction, the risk that the Transaction does not close in the first quarter of 2025 or at all, changes in applicable laws or regulations, the possibility that Bigtincan or SPAC may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors, economic uncertainty caused by the impacts from the conflict in Russia and Ukraine and rising levels of inflation and interest rates, the risk that the approval of Bigtincan shareholders of the Transaction is not obtained, the risk that the approval of the shareholders of SPAC for the Transaction is not obtained, the risk that the PIPE Investment (as such term is defined in the BCA) is not completed prior to the closing of the Transaction or at all, the risk that even if the PIPE Investment is completed, it will not be sufficient to fund the execution of Pubco’s business plan, the amount of redemption requests made by SPAC’s shareholders and the amount of funds remaining in SPAC’s trust account after the satisfaction of such requests, Bigtincan’s and SPAC’s ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of the Transaction, the risks discussed in Bigtincan’s public reports filed with the Australian Securities Exchange (the “ASX”), and the risks discussed in SPAC’s public reports filed with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as preliminary and definitive proxy statements/prospectuses and other filings that Pubco, SPAC and/or Bigtincan intend to file with the SEC or the ASX in connection with the Transaction. If any of these risks materialize or Bigtincan’s or SPAC’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that neither Bigtincan or SPAC presently know or that Bigtincan or SPAC believe are immaterial, that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Bigtincan’s and SPAC’s expectations, plans, or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Bigtincan and SPAC anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause their assessments to materially change. Bigtincan and SPAC specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

(“**IAAC** ”) (Nasdaq: IVCA)1 is pleased to announce that it has agreed to terms with Bigtincan Holdings Limited (“**Bigtincan** ”) (ASX:BTH) under which, if implemented, IAAC would combine with Bigtincan’s business and list on the Nasdaq through a newly formed Cayman Islands exempted company called “**Bigtincan Limited** ” (the “**Transaction** ”). \n\n**Transaction Highlights**\n\n  * Implied pre-money equity valuation of Bigtincan of US$275m2 on a fully diluted basis being A$0.483 per share based on the assumptions described in the footnote below \n  * Investcorp Cayman Holdings Limited (“**Investcorp** ”), an affiliate of the sponsor of IAAC, has committed to invest US$12.5m (~A$18.7m4) into Bigtincan Limited by way of subscription for ordinary shares as part of the Transaction \n  * In addition, Bigtincan Limited will seek to raise up to US$25.0m (~A$37.3m5) from institutional investors in a PIPE6 transaction and up to US$25m of debt finance to support the Transaction \n  * Pursuant to the Transaction, a partial cash election alternative is intended to be made available to Bigtincan shareholders, under which Bigtincan shareholders may elect to receive cash consideration for their shares of US$0.16145 (~A$0.2417) per Bigtincan share, subject to availability of funds and a scale back mechanism8\n  * Bigtincan shareholders will own approximately 75%9 of Bigtincan Limited immediately following implementation of the Transaction, subject to cash elections available to and made by Bigtincan shareholders, the number of Bigtincan Limited shares sold to PIPE investors and redemptions made by IAAC shareholders \n\n\n\nHarsh Shethia, a 22-year veteran of Investcorp and advisor to IAAC said: \"This transaction offers tremendous value not just for Bigtincan's shareholders, but also for its customers, employees, and partners. It’s a chance to showcase Australia’s strength in AI innovation, especially in sectors like sales enablement, and position an Australian-born company as a global leader in enterprise software. We’re excited to help Bigtincan take the next step in its journey.” \n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\nUnder the Business Combination Agreement (“**BCA** ”), scheme implementation deed (“**SID** ”) and related Transaction documents: \n\n  * IAAC will merge with and into BTH Merger Sub Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bigtincan Limited (“**Merger Sub** ”), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company of that merger; \n  * BTH will be acquired by Bigtincan Limited in a scheme of arrangement, with all of the shares in BTH being exchanged for ordinary shares in Bigtincan Limited, or, if a cash election facility is established and a valid cash election has been made by the applicable BTH shareholder, a cash payment; and \n  * Bigtincan Limited shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. \n\n\n\nBigtincan shareholders will receive 1 Bigtincan Limited share for every 30.97 Bigtincan shares held in the Transaction, with the result that Bigtincan shareholders will own up to ~75%10 of Bigtincan ordinary shares immediately following the closing of the Transaction. \n\nA partial cash election facility may be established, under which Bigtincan shareholders may elect to receive cash consideration for their shares of US$0.16145 (~A$0.24111) per Bigtincan share, subject to availability of funds and a scale back mechanism. If activated, Bigtincan shareholders on the register as of 12:01am today will be given preferential access for their first 5,000 shares under the cash election facility (meaning those shareholders will be entitled to receive the cash scheme consideration on those shares before any pro-rata scale back is applied). \n\nInvestcorp will invest US$12.5m (~A$18.7m12) into Bigtincan Limited as part of the Transaction, the proceeds of which will be used to fund the partial cash election facility. If additional funds can be secured which, together with the foregoing PIPE by Investcorp, aggregate to at least USD$15m, the partial cash election facility will be activated. \n\nIn addition, Bigtincan Limited will seek to raise up to US$25.0m (~A$37.3m13) of PIPE from institutional investors and up to US$25m of debt financing to support the Transaction. \n\nImplementation of the Transaction under the Transaction Documents is subject to the satisfaction (or, where applicable, waiver) of various conditions precedent, including: \n\n  * Bigtincan shareholders passing an advisory resolution at the Bigtincan 2024 AGM in support of the Transaction (“**AGM Resolution** “); \n  * Foreign Investment Review Board approval in Australia; \n  * customary conditions to a scheme of arrangement, including Bigtincan shareholder approval of the scheme (by 75% of the votes cast and 50% by number of Bigtincan shareholders present and voting) and Australian court approval of the scheme; \n  * an independent expert concluding that the Transaction is in the best interests of Bigtincan shareholders; \n  * a registration statement of Bigtincan Limited containing a proxy statement of IAAC and a prospectus for Bigtincan Limited shares being declared effective by the SEC for the purposes of obtaining IAAC shareholder approval and registering the Bigtincan Limited shares being issued in exchange for Bigtincan shares; \n  * approval by the IAAC shareholders of the Transaction, Transaction documents and certain other proposals to be presented at a meeting of IAAC shareholders; \n  * listing of Bigtincan Limited shares on Nasdaq; and \n  * there being no material adverse effect, prescribed occurrence or breach of representations and warranties in respect of any party to the transaction documents. \n\n\n\nThe SID contains reciprocal customary exclusivity provisions (including ‘no-shop’, ‘no-talk’ and due diligence restrictions, and a notification obligation). IAAC also has a matching right. \n\nNo break fee is payable by Bigtincan to IAAC (and vice versa) if the AGM Resolution is not passed and the Transaction Documents are terminated. If the AGM Resolution is passed, then Bigtincan and IAAC may each be liable to pay a break fee to the other of US$2.75 million in the circumstances outlined in the SID. \n\nApproval of the AGM Resolution does not mean the Transaction will occur as it will remain subject to other conditions precedent, including approval by Bigtincan shareholders at a subsequent scheme meeting. \n\n**Unanimous Recommendation of the Directors**\n\nThe board of directors of IAAC considers entry into the BCA and the SID to be in the best interests of IAAC’s shareholders and unanimously recommends that IAAC’s shareholders vote in favor of the Transaction. \n\n**Indicative Timing and Next Steps**\n\nIAAC shareholders do not need to take any action at this stage. \n\nA registration statement on Form F-4 of Bigtincan Limited (the “**Registration Statement** ”) will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**SEC** ”), which will contain a proxy statement of IAAC to solicit IAAC shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting of IAAC shareholders and a prospectus of Bigtincan Limited to register the Bigtincan Limited shares to be issued in connection with the Transaction. Once the SEC has declared the Registration Statement effective, it will be promptly mailed to IAAC’s shareholders, along with a proxy card for each IAAC shareholder entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting. \n\n**About IAAC**(NASDAQ:IVCA) \n\nInvestcorp AI Acquisition Corp.

(Nasdaq: IVCA) (“**IVCA** ”) announced today that it has substantially concluded its diligence work and negotiations with Bigtincan Holdings Limited (ASX: BTH) (“**BTH** ”) in connection with IVCA’s previously announced proposal to consummate a business combination with BTH that would bring BTH to Nasdaq (the “**IVCA Proposal** ”). \n\nPursuant to the IVCA Proposal and the subsequent negotiations, it is anticipated that the final definitive agreements would contemplate the exchange of all the shares in BTH for shares in Bigtincan Limited (“**Pubco** ”), a newly formed Cayman Islands holding company at an implied equity value of US$275 million (~A$0.47 per BTH share) on a fully diluted basis and assuming an AUD/USD exchange rate of 0.69. \n\nIVCA believes that the transactions contemplated by the IVCA Proposal and subsequent negotiations between IVCA and BTH (together, the “**Transaction** ”) offers the best value to BTH shareholders, customers, employees and partners and presents an opportunity to allow BTH to capitalize on its innovative work in sales enablement and AI technologies to build a global leader in one of the most exciting sectors within enterprise software. \n\nSubject to the execution of definitive documentation, it is expected that Investcorp Investment Holdings Limited (“**Investcorp** ”) will commit to making an initial US$12.5 million equity investment into Pubco to support its transition to Nasdaq. As currently contemplated (and subject to the execution of definitive documentation), it is expected that, in connection with the Transaction, BTH would be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange (“**ASX** ”), Pubco will become publicly listed on Nasdaq, and Investcorp will own approximately 20% of the equity of Pubco following the consummation of the Transaction at an approximate cost of US$4.73 per share of Pubco common equity (which, as currently contemplated, would equal approximately A$0.22 per share of common equity of BTH). \n\nPursuant to the Transaction, it is expected that the executed definitive documentation will include a cash facility to be made available to current shareholders of BTH who hold less than 5,000 shares of BTH common equity would have the option to sell their shares to BTH prior to the consummation of the Transaction at a price of approximately A$0.235 per share of BTH common equity tendered (subject to certain scale backs), which, if enacted, would represent a premium of approximately A$0.060 when compared to the current market price of shares of BTH common equity as of October 11, 2024 (approximately A$0.175). \n\nIVCA believes that the Transaction, as currently contemplated, provides the best alternative for BTH shareholders and provides a path to take an innovative Australian business to a listing on Nasdaq. Additionally, IVCA is committed to supporting Henslow and Jett Capital, BTH’s corporate advisors, to find potential avenues for liquidity to BTH’s current shareholders who cannot or do not have a desire to hold Pubco shares following the consummation of the Transactions. \n\nAs currently contemplated by IVCA and BTH, it is expected that Pubco will continue to invest in Australia, including the potential establishment of an AI Technology Center based around the existing BTH team in Tasmania. \n\nAs currently contemplated, the Transaction does not have any financing conditions and is subject to, among other things, the entry into definitive agreements by IVCA and BTH, which IVCA believes are close to finalization and execution. Once the binding definitive agreements have been executed, IVCA expects that the Transaction will be subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of IVCA shareholder approval, BTH shareholder approval, and the receipt of approval by both U.S. and Australian regulators. \n\n**About IVCA**\n\nIVCA was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. \n\n**_Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release includes certain statements that are not historical facts, but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on current expectations of the management of IVCA and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction, or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of IVCA. Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those express or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the ability of BTH and IVCA to sign definitive documentation in connection with the Transaction on a timely basis or at all, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted in connection with the Transaction, delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or complete regulatory reviews required to complete the Transaction, the risk that the Transaction disrupts current plans and operations, the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Pubco to grow and manage growth profitably with customers and suppliers and retain key employees, costs related to the Transaction, the risk that the Transaction does not close at all, changes in applicable laws or regulations, the possibility that IVCA may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors, uncertainty caused by the impacts from the conflict in Russia and Ukraine and risking levels of inflation and interest rates, the risk that the approval of the shareholders of BTH or IVCA is not obtained, BTH’s and IVCA’s ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of the Transaction, and the risks discussed in IVCA’s public records filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**SEC** ”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as preliminary and definitive proxy statements/prospectuses that Investcorp may file with the SEC in connection with the Transaction. If any of these risks materialize or IVCA’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results would differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that IVCA presently does not know or that IVCA believes are immaterial, which would also cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect IVCA’s expectations, plans, or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. IVCA anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its assessments to change. IVCA specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

This press release shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
