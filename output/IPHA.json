Innate’s pipeline includes five drug candidates that have merged from the ANKET ® platform: SAR443579/IPH6101 (SAR’579; trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46xCD16 NKCE), SAR445514/IPH6401 (SAR’514 trifunctional anti-BCMA NKp46xCD16 NKCE), IPH62 (anti-B7-H3), IPH67 (target undisclosed, solid tumors) and tetra-specific IPH6501 (anti-CD20 with IL-2v). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored. \n\n**IPH6501 (proprietary)**\n\nIPH6501 is Innate’s proprietary tetra-specific second-generation ANKET ® targeting CD20 with an IL-2v. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6501 in B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL) is ongoing and enrolling patients. \n\n  * Preclinical data supporting the evaluation of IPH6501 in relapsed or refractory B-NHL subtypes and post-CAR-T therapy were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting. \n\n\n\n**SAR’579/IPH6101, SAR’514/IPH6401, IPH62 and IPH67 (partnered with Sanofi)**\n\n**SAR’579/IPH6101**\n\nThe Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well, evaluating SAR’579 / IPH6101, a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46xCD16 NK-cell engager and ANKET ® platform lead asset, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). \n\n**SAR’514/IPH6401**\n\nThe Sanofi led Phase 1/2 clinical trial with SAR’514 / IPH6401, a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK-cell engager, in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis is ongoing. \n\n**IPH62, IPH67 and option**\n\n  * IPH62 is a NK-cell engager program targeting B7-H3 under development from Innate’s ANKET ® platform. Following a research collaboration period and upon candidate selection, Sanofi will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization. \n  * During the third quarter of 2024, Sanofi terminated the IPH67 license during the research collaboration period. As a consequence, Innate plans to regain the full rights to IPH67, an NK-cell engager program in solid tumors from Innate’s ANKET ® platform. The rest of the 2022 research collaboration and license agreement remains unchanged. \n  * Sanofi still retains the option of one additional ANKET ® target under the terms of the 2022 research collaboration and license agreement. \n\n\n\n**Antibody Drug Conjugates:**\n\nInnate is leveraging its antibody engineering capabilities and is also exploring Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats. \n\n** IPH4502 (Nectin-4 ADC): **\n\nIPH4502 is Innate’s novel and differentiated topoisomerase I inhibitor ADC targeting Nectin-4. \n\n  * In September, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Innate’s investigational new drug (IND) application to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study of IPH4502 in Nectin-4 expressing solid tumor indications. Innate expects to initiate the Phase 1 study by Q1 2025. \n    * The Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study, will include a Part 1 Dose Escalation and a Part 2 Dose Optimization, and will assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of IPH4502 as a single agent in advanced solid tumors known to express Nectin-4, including but not limited to urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and colorectal cancers. \n  * Preclinical data of IPH4502 in Nectin-4 expressing tumors were presented at the SITC 2024 Annual Meeting. \n\n\n\n** Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody), partnered with AstraZeneca: **\n\n  * The Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial run by AstraZeneca evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is ongoing. This follows the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation for the continuation of the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial based on a pre-planned analysis. \n\n\n\n** IPH5201 (anti-CD39), partnered with AstraZeneca: **\n\n  * The MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201, an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, is ongoing and recruitment is on track. Following a pre-planned interim analysis, the MATISSE Phase 2 trial continues according to plans. \n\n\n\n** IPH5301 (anti-CD73): **\n\n  * The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 by Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing. \n\n\n\n**Corporate update**\n\n  * The Supervisory Board appointed Jonathan Dickinson as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Executive Board, effective November 1, 2024. Jonathan Dickinson succeeds Hervé Brailly, co-founder of the Company, who was interim CEO, during the search process. Jonathan Dickinson most recently served as Executive Vice President and General Manager, Europe at Incyte, a role he held since 2016. Prior to Incyte, he gained significant leadership experience through several senior positions at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, a US oncology focused biotechnology company and Bristol-Myers Squibb. This followed a distinguished 13-year tenure at Hoffmann-La Roche, where he was instrumental in driving the success of several of the company’s flagship oncology therapies. Mr. Dickinson began his career at Novartis, holding roles of increasing responsibility within the oncology and endocrinology divisions. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Genetics and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Nottingham. \n  * The ATM program, pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million of American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) is still in place. As of September 30, 2024, no sales have been made under the program. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and financial assets of the Company amounted to €96.4 million as of September 30, 2024. At the same date, financial liabilities amounted to €33.2 million. \n\nRevenues for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €10.2 million (€36.5 million for the same period in 2023). For the nine-month period, ended September 30, 2024, revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca and Sanofi. \n\n**About Innate Pharma**\n\nInnate Pharma S.A. is a global, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

IPH6501 is currently evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) (NCT06088654). \n\nThe data published shows that IPH6501, also called CD20-NKCE-IL2v in the publication, boosts NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, showing activity against a range of B-NHL cell lines, including those with low CD20 density. _In vivo_ studies in nonhuman primates and tumor mouse models further validated its efficacy and revealed that IPH6501 induces peripheral NK cell migration at the tumor site. \n\n“ _These new findings underscore the remarkable potential of IPH6501 to transform the treatment landscape for B-NHL._ _IPH6501 showed greater killing efficacy over a T cell engager targeting CD20 in in vitro preclinical models while presenting reduced toxicities compared with those commonly associated with T cell therapies. We are particularly encouraged by results that reveal IPH6501’s ability to drive NK cell migration directly to tumor sites, highlighting its potential as a game-changer in immuno-oncology. These findings are a testament to the promise of NK cell therapies to deliver safer and more targeted solutions for patients in need,_ ” commented **Eric Vivier, DVM, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Innate Pharma** . \n\nThe data published further support the current clinical development plan of IPH6501 in Relapsed/Refractory B-NHL. \n\n**About ANKET ® **\n\n[ ANKET ® ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.innate-pharma.com%2Fscience%2Four-nk-cell-engager-platform&esheet=54154200&newsitemid=20241118258203&lan=en-US&anchor=ANKET%26%23174%3B&index=2&md5=08506f80167548221d97654a563f2e7b) ( **A** ntibody-based **NK** cell **E** ngager **T** herapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation, multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. This versatile, fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer. \n\n**About IPH6501**\n\nIPH6501 is the first Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutic to co-engage activating receptors on NK cells (NKp46 and CD16), IL-2R (but not a subunit) through a variant of human IL-2, and a tumor antigen (CD20) via a single molecule, hence providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells and promoting their cytotoxic activity against CD20 expressing malignant cells. \n\nIPH6501 has shown better anti-tumor efficacy than approved benchmark antibodies in preclinical tumor models (Demaria, EHA 2023, Carrette, SITC 2024, Demaria et al, Science Immunology 2024). \n\nIPH6501 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 multicenter trial (NCT06088654), investigating the safety and tolerability of IPH6501 in patients with Relapsed and/or Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. \n\n**About Innate Pharma**\n\nInnate Pharma S.A. is a global, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

Below are some of the principal risks, any one of\nwhich could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects:\n• Biopharmaceutical development involves a high degree of uncertainty and most of the product\ncandidates are in early stages of development.\n• The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates is both\npreliminary and limited.\n• The Company intends to develop several of its product candidates in combination with other\ntherapies, which exposes it to additional risks.\n• The Company is heavily dependent on the success of its current clinical-stage product candidates\n• The Company may not be successful in its efforts to develop additional products that receive\nregulatory approval and are successfully commercialized.\n• The Company may encounter substantial delays in its clinical studies or may be unable to conduct\nits clinical studies on the timelines the Company expects.\n• The Company's product candidates in development may cause undesirable side effects or have\nother properties that could halt or delay their clinical development, prevent their regulatory\napproval, limit their commercialization or result in other negative consequences.\n• The Company faces substantial competition from companies with significantly greater resources\nand experience.\n• The regulatory processes that will govern the approval of the Company’s product candidates are\ncomplex and changes in regulatory requirements could result in delays or discontinuation of\ndevelopment or unexpected costs in obtaining regulatory approval.\n• Any of the Company's product candidates, if approved and commercialized, may fail to achieve\nmarket acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community to a\ndegree that is necessary for commercial success.\n• A fast track, breakthrough therapy or other designation by the FDA, or equivalent in other\nterritories, may not actually lead to a faster development.\n• The Company has no manufacturing capabilities and relies on third-party manufacturers for its\nproduct candidates.\n• The Company relies on third parties to supply key materials used in its research and development,\nto provide services to the Company and to assist with clinical studies.\n• The Company depends upon its existing collaboration partners, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and other\nthird parties, and may depend upon future collaboration partners to commit to the research,\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing of its drugs.\n• The late-stage development and marketing of the Company’s product candidates may partially\ndepend on its ability to establish collaborations with major biopharmaceutical companies.\n• The Company has incurred and may in the future incur significant operational losses related to its\nresearch and development activities.\n9\n• The Company may need to raise additional funding to complete the development and any\ncommercialization of its product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or\nat all, and failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force it to delay, limit or\nterminate its product development efforts or other operations.\n• If the Company does not achieve its product development or commercialization objectives in the\ntimeframes it expects, the Company may not receive product revenue or milestone or royalty\npayments, and it may not be able to conduct its operations as planned.\n• The revenues generated from the Company’s collaboration and license agreements have\ncontributed and are expected to contribute a large portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future.\n• The Company benefits from tax credits in France that could be reduced or eliminated.\n• The current state of the world financial market and current economic conditions could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• The Company's business could be affected by natural disaster, such as wildfire, and this could be\nexacerbated by climate change.\n• The Company’s ability to compete may be adversely affected if the Company does not adequately\nobtain, maintain, protect and enforce its intellectual property or proprietary rights, or if the scope\nof intellectual property protection the Company obtains is not sufficiently broad.\n• The Company’s patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged, and it may not be\nable to protect its intellectual property.\n• The dual listing of the Company’s ordinary shares and the ADSs may adversely affect the\nliquidity and value of the ADSs.\n• The Company may be affected by political, social, legal and economic instability, civil unrest,\nwar and other geopolitical tension, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and\nUkraine and economic sanctions related thereto.\nPART I\nItem 1.

Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\nC. Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n10\nD. Risk Factors\nThe Company's business faces significant risks. You should carefully consider all of the information set\nforth in this Annual Report and in the other filings with the SEC, including the following risk factors\nwhich Innate faces and which are faced by its industry. The Company's business, financial condition or\nresults of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This report also\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Innate's results could materially\ndiffer from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain factors, including\nthe risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report and its other SEC filings. See “Special\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.\nRisks Related to the Development of the Product Candidates\nBiopharmaceutical development involves a high degree of uncertainty and most of the product\ncandidates are in early stages of development, which makes it difficult to evaluate the current business\nand future prospects and may increase the risk of your investment.\nInnate Pharma is a global, clinical stage oncology-focused biotech company developing a portfolio of\nproduct candidates, some of which Innate is co-developing, in the early stages of clinical development\nand preclinical programs.\nA key element of Innate's strategy is to mature and expand its portfolio of proprietary and partnered\nproduct candidates to address unmet medical needs in immuno-oncology. Although Innate's research and\ndevelopment efforts to date have resulted in a pipeline of product candidates, all of its product candidates\nrequire additional development, regulatory review and approvals, substantial investment, access to\nsufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before they can be\ncommercialized and before Innate can generate any revenue from product sales or royalties. If the\nCompany or its collaboration partners are unable to successfully develop and market these product\ncandidates, its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely\naffected.\nAside from Innate's commercial experience with Lumoxiti that ended in December 2020, its operations to\ndate have been limited to developing its product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and\nclinical studies of its product candidates, including monalizumab and IPH5201, through its partnership\nwith AstraZeneca; IPH6101/SAR'579 through its partnership with Sanofi; and lacutamab, IPH5301 and\nIPH6501, its most advanced product candidates, currently in the clinical stage. The success in\ndevelopment of its current and future product candidates by the Company or its collaborators will depend\non many factors, including:\n• obtaining positive results in clinical trials, including by demonstrating efficacy, safety and\ndurability of effect of such product candidates;\n• completing preclinical studies and receiving regulatory approvals or clearance for conducting\nclinical trials for its preclinical programs;\n• receiving and maintaining approvals for commercialization of such product candidates from\nregulatory authorities;\n• manufacturing or overseeing the manufacturing of its product candidates in acceptable\nquantities and at an acceptable cost;\n• negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which\nthe Company may enter, and performing its obligations pursuant to such arrangements;\n11\n• maintaining, protecting, enforcing and expanding its portfolio of intellectual property rights,\nincluding patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n• avoiding and defending against third-party interference, infringement or other intellectual\nproperty claims; and\n• maintaining and growing an organization of scientists, medical professionals and marketing,\ndistribution and sales personnel and executives who can develop its product candidates and\ncommercialize any approved products.\nIn addition, if the Company is unable to reduce its dependence on its current clinical and preclinical\nproduct candidates, either by in-licensing or acquiring new product candidates, developing its other\nproduct candidates or discovering new product candidates, the Company may be similarly adversely\naffected.\nThe scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates is both preliminary\nand limited.\nInnate Pharma's innovative approach to immuno-oncology aims to activate both the innate and adaptive\nimmune systems against abnormal or cancerous cells and restore the body’s ability to disrupt their\nproliferation, potentially leading to durable responses in patients. This approach is focused on developing\ncheckpoint inhibitors, tumor-targeting antibodies and antibodies that affect the tumor microenvironment,\nand several of the product candidates rely on novel mechanisms of action and on innovative formats for\nwhich the Company has limited scientific evidence and preclinical and clinical data.\nThe Company may not ultimately be able to provide the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or\nother regulatory authorities with substantial clinical evidence to support a claim of efficacy and durability\nof response to enable the applicable regulators to approve its product candidates for any indication. This\nmay occur because later clinical studies fail to reproduce favorable data obtained in earlier clinical trials,\nbecause the applicable regulator disagrees with how the Company interprets the data from these clinical\ntrials or because the applicable regulator does not accept these therapeutic effects as valid endpoints in\npivotal clinical trials that are sufficient to grant marketing approval. Additionally, because product\ncandidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite\nhaving progressed through preclinical studies and earlier clinical studies, its collaborators in earlier stages\nof clinical trials may eventually choose to discontinue later stage studies. For example, following initial\npromising results assessing the safety and efficacy of the Company's product candidate lirilumab for the\ntreatment of various cancer indications, the Company's collaborator decided not to continue development\nafter receiving Phase 2 clinical study data. Moreover, in 2022, AstraZeneca informed Innate Pharma of\nthe discontinuation of the Interlink-1 Phase 3 clinical study assessing monalizumab in combination with\ncetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, as this\ncombination did not meet a pre-defined threshold for efficacy.\nIn addition to the safety and efficacy traits of any product candidate, clinical study failures may result\nfrom a multitude of factors, including flaws in study design, dose selection, placebo effect and patient\nenrollment criteria. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant\nsetbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding\npromising results in earlier studies, and it is possible that the Company will as well. Based upon negative\nor inconclusive results, the Company or its collaborators may decide, or regulators may require the\nCompany, to conduct additional clinical studies or preclinical studies. In addition, data obtained from\nstudies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret the Company's data as\nfavorably as the Company does, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\n12\nThe Company will also need to demonstrate that its product candidates are safe and well tolerated. The\nCompany does not have significant data on possible harmful long-term effects of its product candidates\nand does not expect to have this data in the near future. As a result, its ability to generate clinical safety\nand efficacy data sufficient to support submission of a marketing application or commercialization of its\nproduct candidates is uncertain and is subject to significant risk.\nThe Company intends to develop several of its product candidates in combination with other therapies,\nwhich exposes the Company to additional risks.\nThe Company is currently developing monalizumab, lacutamab, IPH5201 and IPH5301, and may develop\nother product candidates, in combination with one or more currently approved cancer therapies.\nSpecifically, AstraZeneca is currently evaluating monalizumab in ongoing Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials in\ncombination with durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Lacutamab is also currently\nevaluated in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) in\npatients with PTCL (Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma). In addition, IPH5201 is also currently under clinical\ninvestigation, in a Phase 2 study in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy. Finally, IPH5301 is\ncurrently under clinical investigation in a Phase 1 study in combination with a chemotherapy, paclitaxel\nand trastuzumab. Patients may not be able to tolerate the Company's product candidates in combination\nwith other therapies, and preliminary clinical results indicate that monalizumab, for example, has no\nmeaningful clinical activity as a monotherapy. Even if any product candidate the Company develops were\nto receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies,\nthe Company would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with its product candidate\nor that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies.\nCombination therapies are commonly used for the treatment of cancer, and the Company would be\nsubject to similar risks if the Company develops any of its product candidates for use in combination with\nother therapies or for indications other than cancer. This could result in its own products, if approved,\nbeing removed from the market or being less successful commercially.\nThe Company may also evaluate any of its current and future product candidates in combination with one\nor more other cancer therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA, EMA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities. The Company will not be able to market and sell\nmonalizumab, lacutamab, IPH5201 or IPH5301 or any other product candidate the Company develops in\ncombination with any such unapproved cancer therapies that do not ultimately obtain marketing approval.\nIf the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve, revoke their\napproval of, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues arise with, the products or product\ncandidates the Company chooses to evaluate in combination with monalizumab, lacutamab, IPH5201,\nIPH5301 or any other product candidate the Company develops, the Company may be unable to obtain\napproval of or market monalizumab or any other such product candidate the Company develops.\nThe Company is heavily dependent on the success of its current clinical-stage product candidates, and\nit cannot be certain that it or its collaborators will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or\nsuccessfully commercialize, these product candidates.\nThe Company's business and future success depend on receiving regulatory approval for, and the\ncommercial success of, its proprietary and partnered product candidates. The Company has agreements\nwith AstraZeneca with respect to the advanced development, clinical study collaboration and potential\nfuture registration and marketing of several of its product candidates, including monalizumab and\nIPH5201, and with Sanofi for the research and development of IPH6101/SAR'579, IPH6401/SAR’514,\nIPH62 and of another program in solid tumors. Its near-term prospects depend heavily on AstraZeneca’s\nsuccessful clinical development and commercialization of monalizumab, as well as the successful clinical\n13\ndevelopment of its other product candidates. The clinical success of these product candidates will depend\non a number of factors, including the ability and willingness of AstraZeneca, Sanofi and the Company's\nother collaborators to complete ongoing clinical studies respectively for monalizumab and IPH6101/\nSAR'579 or other partnered assets, the ability to complete the clinical trials for which the Company is\nresponsible and the safety, tolerability and efficacy of its product candidates.\nThe Company may not be successful in its efforts to develop additional products that receive regulatory\napproval and are successfully commercialized.\nThe development of a product candidate is a long, costly and uncertain process, aimed at demonstrating\nthe therapeutic benefit of a product candidate that competes with existing products or those being\ndeveloped. There is no guarantee that the Company or its collaborators will be able to demonstrate a\nsufficient degree of clinical efficacy or safety of one or more of its proprietary or licensed product\ncandidates in order to gain regulatory approval or to become commercially viable. The degree of\nuncertainty associated with clinical development and the risks associated with developing new product\ncandidates may make it difficult to evaluate its current business and its future prospects.\nThe Company intends to continue to develop its product candidates that are currently in clinical trials,\nincluding monalizumab, lacutamab, IPH5201, IPH5301, IPH6101/SAR'579 and IPH6501. Monalizumab\nis currently being investigated in multiple Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies under a co-\ndevelopment agreement with AstraZeneca. Lacutamab is currently being investigated in an open-label,\nmulti-cohort Phase 2 clinical study in CTCL and in Phases 1 and 2 in PTCL. IPH5201 is currently being\ninvestigated in an open-label Phase 2 clinical study. IPH5301 is currently being investigated in a Phase 1\nclinical study sponsored by the Institut Paoli-Calmettes. IPH6101/SAR'579 is currently investigated in a\nPhase 1/2 clinical study sponsored by Sanofi. IPH6501 is currently investigated in a first-in-human, Phase\n1/2 study in B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma indication.\nWhile the Company believes that it will eventually have the in-house capabilities to complete the\ndevelopment and/or support the development by a partner of monalizumab, lacutamab, IPH5201,\nIPH5301, IPH6101/SAR'579 and IPH6501, the Company has not yet completed the clinical studies for\nthese or other product candidates, and there can be no assurance that these or other product candidates\nwill gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable.\nDelays in the preclinical development of a product candidate could lead to delays in initiating clinical\ndevelopment. A failure in the preclinical development of a product candidate could lead to abandoning its\ndevelopment. Further delays or failures at the various clinical stages for a given indication could result in\ndelay or halt the development of the product candidate in such indication or in other indications.\nMoreover, disappointing results during the initial Phases of development are often not a sufficient basis\nfor deciding whether or not to continue a project. At these early stages, sample sizes, the duration of\nstudies and the parameters examined may not be sufficient to enable a definitive conclusion to be drawn,\nin which case further investigations are required. Conversely, promising results during the initial phases,\nand even after advanced clinical studies have been conducted, do not guarantee that a product candidate\nor an approved drug will be successfully approved and commercialized.\nThe risks related to the failure of a product candidate’s development are highly related to the stage of\nmaturity of the product candidate. Given the relatively early stage of the product candidates in the\npipeline, there is a substantial risk that some or all of the product candidates will not obtain regulatory\napproval or be commercialized, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n14\nThe Company may not be successful in its efforts to identify, discover or develop additional product\ncandidates, including those based on its innovative ANKET® technology.\nThe Company is seeking to develop a broad and innovative pipeline of product candidates in addition to\nmonalizumab, lacutamab, avdoralimab, IPH5201, IPH5301, IPH6101/SAR'579 and IPH6501. The\nCompany may not be successful in identifying additional product candidates for clinical development for\na number of reasons. For example, its research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential\nproduct candidates or the potential product candidates the Company identifies may have harmful side\neffects, lack of efficacy or other characteristics that make them unmarketable or unlikely to receive\nregulatory approval.\nMoreover, some of its innovative pipeline of product candidates are based on its innovative ANKET®\nplatform, which is not yet approved. The ANKET® platform consists of two different formats, tri-specific\nand tetra-specific antibodies. IPH6101/SAR'579 and IPH6401/SAR'514, in partnership with Sanofi, two\ntri-specific antibodies are currently being investigated in Phase I clinical studies. Another multi-specific is\nalso being developed in partnership with Sanofi (IPH62). Moreover, the Company is developing\nIPH6501, a tetra-specific proprietary antibody, which obtained the FDA's approval to start a first-in-\nhuman study in July 2023. Even if the Company aims at maintaining a diversified pipeline, the use of an\ninnovative technology represents additional risks in the product candidate development.\nResearch programs to pursue the development of the product candidates for additional indications and to\nidentify new product candidates and disease targets require substantial technical, financial and human\nresources. The Company's research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential\nindications or product candidates, yet fail to yield results for clinical development for a number of\nreasons, including:\n• the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential indications or\nproduct candidates;\n• potential product candidates and/or its ANKET® technology may, after further study, be\nshown to have harmful adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to\nbe effective drugs; or\n• it may take greater human and financial resources to identify additional therapeutic\nopportunities for its product candidates or to develop suitable potential product candidates\nthrough internal research programs than the Company will possess, thereby limiting its ability\nto diversify and expand its product portfolio.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever be able to identify additional\nindications for its product candidates or to identify and develop new product candidates through internal\nresearch programs. The Company may focus its efforts and resources on potential product candidates or\nother potential programs that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nThe Company may encounter substantial delays in its clinical studies or may be unable to conduct its\nclinical studies on the timelines the Company expects.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming and subject to uncertainty. The Company cannot guarantee\nthat any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or\nmore clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and its future clinical studies may not be\nsuccessful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n• inability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data to support\nthe initiation of clinical trials;\n• delays or failure in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on clinical study design;\n15\n• delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective Contract Research\nOrganisations (CROs) and investigational sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive\nnegotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and investigational sites;\n• imposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies, including as a\nresult of a new safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical study participants, a\nnegative finding from an inspection of its clinical trial operations or investigational sites,\ndevelopments in trials conducted by competitors for related technology that raise regulators’\nconcerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly or if a regulatory body finds that the\ninvestigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives. For example,\nin November 2019 and in October 2023, the TELLOMAK study sponsored by the Company\nwas put on full or partial holds in a number of countries. The Company was authorized to fully\nresume patient enrollment and treatment after being able to provide the agencies with expected\nmaterial and information ;\n• delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in its clinical studies;\n• difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\n• failure by the Company, its CROs or other third parties, including its collaborators, to adhere\nto clinical study requirements;\n• delays in having patients complete participation in a clinical study or return for post-treatment\nfollow-up;\n• patients withdrawing from a clinical study;\n• occurrence of adverse events associated with a product candidate that are viewed to outweigh\nits potential benefits;\n• changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new\nclinical trial protocols;\n• regulatory feedback requiring the Company to amend the protocols of ongoing clinical studies\nin response to safety considerations, as the Company has previously been required to;\n• changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may\nrequire new or additional clinical trials;\n• the cost of clinical studies of its product candidates being greater than the Company\nanticipates;\n• clinical studies of its product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which\nmay result in the Company deciding, or regulators requiring the Company, to conduct\nadditional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n• transfer of manufacturing processes to larger-scale facilities operated by either a contract\nmanufacturing organization (CMO) and delays or failure by its CMOs or the Company to\nmake any necessary changes to such manufacturing process; and\n• batch recalls, recalls of manufactured product candidates or delays in manufacturing, testing,\nreleasing, validating, or importing or exporting sufficient stable quantities of its product\ncandidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional\ncosts to the Company or impair its ability to generate revenue. In addition, if the Company makes\nmanufacturing or formulation changes to its product candidates, it may be required to or it may elect to\n16\nconduct additional studies to bridge its modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study\ndelays could also shorten any periods during which its products have patent protection and may allow its\ncompetitors to bring products to market before the Company does, which could impair its ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize its product candidates and may harm its business and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on enrollment of patients in its clinical studies for its product candidates.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical studies will require that the Company or its subcontractors\nenroll a sufficient number of suitable patients. Clinical studies may be subject to delays as a result of\npatient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. Patient enrollment depends on\nmany factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, which is typically limited for rare or\norphan diseases, making the enrollment more difficult, eligibility criteria for the study, the proximity of\npatients to clinical sites, the design of the clinical protocol, the availability of competing clinical studies,\nthe availability of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical study is investigating and clinicians’\nand patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other\navailable therapies. For example, the Company is developing lacutamab for the treatment of cutaneous T\ncell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is an orphan disease, which means that the potential patient population is\nlimited. In addition, there are several other product candidates potentially in development for the\nindications for which the Company is developing product candidates, and the Company may compete for\npatients with the sponsors of trials for those drugs. These factors may make it difficult for the Company to\nenroll enough patients to complete its clinical studies in a timely and cost-effective manner. Delays in the\ncompletion of any clinical study of any of its product candidates will increase its costs, slow down its\nproduct candidate development and approval process and delay or potentially jeopardize its ability to\ncommence product sales and generate revenue. In addition, some of the factors that cause, or lead to, a\ndelay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the inability to\nobtain regulatory approval of its product candidates.\nThe Company's product candidates in development may cause undesirable side effects or have other\nproperties that could halt or delay their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit\ntheir commercialization or result in other negative consequences.\nUse of the Company's product candidates in development could be associated with side effects or adverse\nevents, which can vary in severity and in frequency. Undesirable side effects or unacceptable toxicities\ncaused by its products or product candidates could cause the Company or regulatory authorities to\ninterrupt, delay or halt clinical studies. The FDA or European regulatory authorities could delay or deny\napproval of the Company's product candidates for any or all targeted indications and negative side effects\ncould result in a more restrictive label for any drug that is approved. Side effects such as toxicity or other\nsafety issues associated with the use of the Company's product candidates could also require it or its\ncollaborators to perform additional studies or halt development of product candidates or sale of approved\nproducts.\nTreatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to\ncomplete the trial, or could result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may\nnot be appropriately or timely recognized or managed by the treating medical staff, as toxicities resulting\nfrom immunotherapy are not normally encountered in the general patient population and by medical\npersonnel. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of its product\ncandidates could result in adverse effects to patients, including death. Any of these occurrences may have\nan adverse impact on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n17\nThe Company faces substantial competition from companies with significantly greater resources and\nexperience.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical market, and notably the immuno-oncology field, is characterized\nby rapidly advancing technologies, products protected by intellectual property rights and intense\ncompetition and is subject to significant and rapid change as researchers learn more about diseases and\ndevelop new technologies and treatments. The Company faces potential competition from many different\nsources, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nAny product candidates that the Company or its collaborators successfully develop will compete with\nexisting therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. If competing products are\nmarketed before Innate's ones, or at lower prices, or cover a wider therapeutic spectrum, or if they prove\nto be more effective or better tolerated, the Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results\nof operations could be affected.\nMany of the Company's competitors who are developing immuno-oncology and anti-cancer therapies\nhave considerably greater resources and experience in research, drug development, finance,\nmanufacturing, marketing, technology and personnel and access to patients for clinical studies than the\nCompany does. In particular, large pharmaceutical companies have substantially more experience than the\nCompany does in conducting clinical studies and obtaining regulatory authorizations. Mergers and\nacquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more\nresources being concentrated among a smaller number of the Company's competitors. Smaller or early-\nstage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative\narrangements with large and established companies. These competitors are also likely to compete with the\nCompany to recruit and retain scientific and management personnel, acquire rights for promising product\ncandidates and other complementary technologies, establish clinical investigational sites and patient\nregistration for clinical studies and acquire technologies complementary to, or necessary for, its programs,\nas well as to enter into collaborations with partners who have access to innovative technologies. If the\nCompany cannot successfully compete with new or existing products, its marketing and sales will suffer\nand the Company may never be profitable. Should any of these risks materialize, Innate's business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that its product candidates will:\n• obtain regulatory authorizations or become commercially available before those of its\ncompetitors;\n• remain competitive in the face of other products developerid by its competitors, which may\nprove to be safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, be more convenient,\nhave a broader label, have more robust intellectual property protection or be less expensive;\n• remain competitive in the face of products of competitors that are more efficient in their\nmanufacturing or more effective in their marketing; and\n• not become obsolete or unprofitable due to technological progress or other therapies developed\nby its competitors.\nIn addition, while any future product candidate that is approved may compete with many existing drugs or\nother therapies, to the extent it is solely used in combination with these therapies, the Company's product\ncandidates will not be competitive with such therapies, but any sales of such products could be limited to\nsales of the combination therapy. In this case, the Company would be exposed to the same competitive\nrisks as the product used in combination with its product, such as a product that is marketed before the\ncombination therapy, has lower prices, covers a wider therapeutic spectrum or proves to be more effective\n18\nor better tolerated. For additional information regarding competition to its business see “Business—\nCompetition.”\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Innate's Product Candidates and Legal\nCompliance Matters\nEven if the Company completes the necessary preclinical and clinical studies, the marketing approval\nprocess is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent the Company from obtaining\napprovals for the commercialization of some or all of its product candidates. If the Company is not able\nto obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, in particular in the United\nStates or the European Union, the Company will not be able to commercialize its product candidates,\nand its ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe research and development of pharmaceutical products is governed by complex regulatory\nrequirements. The regulatory agencies that oversee these requirements have the authority to permit the\ncommencement of clinical studies or to temporarily or permanently halt a study. They are entitled to\nrequest additional clinical data before authorizing the commencement or resumption of a study, which\ncould result in delays or changes to the product development plan. As the Company advances its product\ncandidates, the Company will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and comply with all\napplicable guidelines, rules and regulations. If the Company fails to do so, the Company may be required\nto delay or discontinue development of its product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected\ncosts in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease\nits ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain its business.\nThe clinical studies of Innate's product candidates, the manufacturing and the marketing of its product\ncandidates are and will be, subject to regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States,\nin the European Union and in other countries where the Company intends to test and, if approved, market\nany product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product\ncandidate, the Company must demonstrate, with substantial evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical\ntrials, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, with respect to\napproval in the European Union, to the satisfaction of the EMA or, with respect to approval in other\ncountries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidate is safe and effective\nfor use in each target indication.\nWhen the Company acquired Lumoxiti, AstraZeneca had already obtained marketing approval from the\nFDA and they also filed the Marketing Authorization in the European Union. The Company has never\nsubmitted a product candidate for marketing approval in the United States, in the European Union or\nelsewhere.\nIn the United States, the Company expects that the requisite regulatory submission to seek marketing\nauthorization for its product candidates will be a Biologic License Application (BLA) and the competent\nregulatory authority is the FDA. In the European Union, the requisite approval is a Marketing\nAuthorization (MA), which for products developed by the means of antibody-based therapeutics, gene or\ncell therapy products as well as tissue engineered products, is issued through a centralized procedure\ninvolving the EMA (see “Business—Regulation”). Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements\nis costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. Failure to comply with the\napplicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after\napproval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include,\nfor example, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical\nhold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or\n19\npartial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts,\nrestitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.\nData from preclinical and clinical studies are likely to give rise to different interpretations, which could\ndelay regulatory authorization, restrict the scope of any such authorization or force Innate to repeat trials\nin order to meet the requirements of the various regulators. Regulatory requirements and processes vary\nwidely among countries, and the Company may be unable to obtain authorization within each relevant\ncountry in a timely manner. Regulatory authorities may prevent Innate from starting clinical studies or\ncontinuing clinical development if the data were not produced according to applicable regulations or if\nthey consider that the balance between the expected benefits of the product and its possible risks is not\nsufficient to justify the trial.\nDespite the Company's efforts, its product candidates may not:\n• offer improvement over existing, comparable products;\n• be proven safe and effective in clinical trials; or\n• meet applicable regulatory standards.\nThis process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which will\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources beyond the existing cash on hand. Of the large number of\ndrugs in development globally, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval\nprocess and not all approved drugs are successfully commercialized. Delay or failure to obtain, or\nunexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary for the Company or its partners to bring\na potential product candidate to market could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory processes that will govern the approval of Innate's product candidates are complex and\nchanges in regulatory requirements could result in delays or discontinuation of development or\nunexpected costs in obtaining regulatory approval.\nThe Company's product candidates are based on new approaches and/or technologies that are constantly\nevolving and have not been extensively tested on humans. The applicable regulatory requirements vary\nbetween jurisdictions and are also complex, potentially difficult to apply and subject to significant\nmodifications. Modifications to regulations during the course of clinical development and regulatory\nreview may lead to delays or the refusal of authorization.\nIn Europe, the United States and other countries, regulations can potentially:\n• significantly delay or increase the cost of development, testing, manufacturing and marketing\nof Innate's products;\n• limit the indications for which the Company will be authorized to market its products; and\n• impose new, more stringent requirements, suspend marketing authorizations or request the\nsuspension of clinical trials or the marketing of its products if unexpected results are obtained\nduring trials performed by other researchers on products similar to its products.\nMarketing authorization in one jurisdiction does not ensure marketing authorization in another, but a\nfailure or delay in obtaining marketing authorization in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the\nregulatory process in others. Failure to obtain marketing authorization in other countries or any delay or\nsetback in obtaining such approval would impair the Company's ability to develop additional markets for\nits product candidates. This would reduce Innate's target market and limit the full commercial potential of\nits product or product candidates. Should any of these risks materialize, this could harm its business.\n20\nInnate Pharma's failure to obtain marketing approval in jurisdictions other than the United States and\nEurope would prevent Innate's product candidates from being marketed in these other jurisdictions,\nand any approval the Company is granted for its product candidates in the United States and Europe\nwould not assure approval of product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell its other product candidates in jurisdictions other than the United States and\nEurope, the Company must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying\nregulatory requirements. The approval process varies among countries and can involve additional testing.\nThe time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or approvals\nfrom regulatory authorities in the European Union. The regulatory approval process outside the United\nStates and Europe generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or approvals\nfrom regulatory authorities in the European Union. In addition, some countries outside the United States\nand Europe require approval of the sales price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries,\nseparate procedures must be followed to obtain reimbursement, and a product may not be approved for\nsale in the country until it is also approved for reimbursement. The Company may not obtain marketing,\npricing or reimbursement approvals outside the United States and Europe on a timely basis, if at all.\nApproval by the FDA or regulatory authorities in the European Union does not ensure approval by\nregulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside\nthe United States and Europe does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or\njurisdictions or by the FDA or regulatory authorities in the European Union. The Company may not be\nable to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize its\nproducts in any market. Marketing approvals in countries outside the United States and Europe do not\nensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing approvals and pricing\napprovals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nSide effects that appear following the launch of a drug on the market may result in the product being\ntaken off the market or additional warnings being added to the label despite having obtained all\nregulatory approvals.\nA drug’s launch in the market may expose a large number of patients to potential risks associated with\ntreatment with a new pharmaceutical product. Certain side effects, which may not have been identified\nduring clinical trials, can subsequently appear. For these reasons, regulatory agencies require companies\nto implement post-approval monitoring. Depending on the occurrence of serious undesirable effects, the\nagencies may require that the Company or a collaboration partner take a drug off the market temporarily\nor permanently, even if it is effective and has obtained all the necessary marketing authorizations. Such an\naction would negatively impair the Company's ability to generate revenue from such product and could\nmore generally negatively affect its ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize\nits other product candidates and its reputation generally, each of which could have a material adverse\neffect on its business and results of operations. In addition, if the product candidates the Company\ndevelops receive marketing authorization and the Company or others identify undesirable side effects\ncaused by any product after the approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could\nresult, including that regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a\n“boxed” warning or a contraindication, the Company may be required to create a medication guide\noutlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients and its reputation may suffer.\nAny product candidate for which the Company obtains marketing approval will be subject to strict\nenforcement of post-marketing requirements and the Company could be subject to substantial\npenalties, including withdrawal of its product from the market, if the Company fails to comply with all\n21\nregulatory requirements or if the Company experiences unanticipated problems with its product and\nproduct candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which the Company obtains marketing approval will be subject to continual\nrequirements of and review by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities, including requirements\nrelating to manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional\nactivities for such product. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing\npromotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and\nreports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), requirements\nrelating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records\nand documents and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nIn addition, even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to\nlimitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, restrictions for specified age\ngroups, warnings, precautions or contraindications or to the conditions of approval.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), closely\nregulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription products, including requirements\npertaining to marketing and promotion of products in accordance with the provisions of the approved\nlabeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. The FDA and DOJ\nimpose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use, and if the\nCompany does not market its products for their approved indications, the Company may be subject to\nenforcement action for off-label marketing. Prescription products may be promoted only for the approved\nindications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may also\nshare truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. Violations of\nsuch requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and\nother statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws,\nas well as state consumer protection laws. The Company's failure to comply with all regulatory\nrequirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with its\nproducts, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n• litigation involving patients taking its products;\n• restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n• restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n• restrictions on product distribution or use;\n• requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n• warning letters or untitled letters;\n• withdrawal of the products from the market;\n• refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that the\nCompany submits;\n• recall of products;\n• fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n• suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n• damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n• unfavorable press coverage and damage to its reputation;\n• refusal to permit the import or export of its products;\n22\n• product seizure; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance by the Company or any future collaborator with the FDA, EMA or other regulatory\nrequirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the\ndevelopment of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nSimilarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information\ncan also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for the\nCompany's product candidates, if approved, which could make it difficult for the Company to sell its\nproduct candidates profitably.\nSuccessful sales of its product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the availability of adequate\ncoverage and reimbursement from government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health\ninsurers and health maintenance organizations. Patients who are provided medical treatment for their\nconditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their\ntreatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid in the United States or Social Security in France, and commercial payors are\ncritical to new product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance\norganizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the\nthird-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:\n• a covered benefit under its health plan;\n• safe, effective and medically necessary;\n• appropriate for the specific patient;\n• cost-effective; and\n• neither experimental nor investigational.\nPolicies for coverage and reimbursement for products vary among third-party payors. No uniform policy\nof coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors, and third-party payors are\nincreasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness\nof approved drugs and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. As a result,\nobtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party\npayor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require the Company or its partners to provide to\neach payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of its products on a payor-\nby-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Coverage\ndecisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more\nestablished or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.\nEven if the Company obtains coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates\nmight not be adequate for it to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients\nfind unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate\nreimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of the Company's product\ncandidates or approved products.\nBecause its product candidates represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer and, accordingly, may\nhave a higher cost than conventional therapies and may require long-term follow-up evaluations, the risk\n23\nthat coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for the Company to achieve profitability may\nbe elevated. There are currently a limited number of immunotherapy products that are designed to treat\ncancer on the market and, accordingly, there is less experience or precedent for the reimbursement of such\ntreatments by governmental entities or third-party payors.\nGovernment restrictions on pricing and reimbursement and other healthcare cost-containment\ninitiatives may negatively affect its ability to generate revenues for its product candidates for which the\nCompany obtains regulatory approval.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of\ncontrolling healthcare costs, including by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for\nparticular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of\ncoverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in\ncompetitive classes and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.\nIn the United States, the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of\nlegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the Company's or its partners’\nability to sell its products profitably.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes a\nnumber of healthcare reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The\nACA, among other things, imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import\nbranded prescription drug products; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by\nmanufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused,\ninstilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under\nthe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid\nmanaged care organizations; and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in\nwhich manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable\nbrand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the\nmanufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions\naffecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with\nhealthcare practitioners. The ACA also revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for\nreporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states.\nThere have been judicial congressional, and executive branch efforts to repeal, modify or delay the\nimplementation of the law. In July and December 2018, CMS published final rules with respect to\npermitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health\ninsurance issuers under its risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court\nlitigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Concurrently, Congress has\nconsidered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has\nnot passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under\nthe ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that\nrepealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on\ncertain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly\nreferred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled\nthat the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by the U.S.\nCongress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Act. Additionally, on June 17, 2021, the U.S.\nSupreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that the ACA is unconstitutional in its\nentirety because the \"individual mandate\" was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA remains in effect in\nits current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden\nissued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period which began on February 15, 2021, and\n24\nremained open through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the\nACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and\nreconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others,\nreexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and\npolicies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through\nMedicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how judicial and Congressional challenges and the healthcare reform\nmeasures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA\nwas enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per\nfiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken by\nCongress, although they have been suspended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or\nCARES, Act, until March 31, 2022. From April through June 2022, a 1% reduction was in effect. As of\nJuly 2, 2022, the 2% cut resumed. Both the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer\nRelief Act of 2012 (ATRA) further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and the ATRA\nincreased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from\nthree to five years. Additional legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance\nprograms, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the\npurchase of medicines and reduce demand and prices for Innate's product candidates, if approved. This\ncould harm Innate's or its partners’ ability to market any drugs and generate revenues. Cost containment\nmeasures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further healthcare reform\ncould significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of its product candidates approved in\nthe future, and could cause an increase in its compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses.\nIn addition, in the United States, federal programs impose penalties on drug manufacturers in the form of\nmandatory additional rebates and/or discounts if commercial prices increase at a rate greater than the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index, and these rebates or discounts, which can be substantial,\nmay affect the Company's ability to raise commercial prices.\nFurther, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to\ndrug pricing practices. There have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and\nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug\npricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of\ndrugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.\nFor example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. This legislation\ncontains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program\nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a\nnegotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the\nestablishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare\nParts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide\ndiscounts on Part D drugs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ annual\nout-of-pocket drug expenses. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the IRA drug\npricing provisions. Provisions of the IRA are subject to legal challenges, and the full impact of the IRA on\nthe pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\nThe U.S. Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new\nlegislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed\nto control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement\nconstraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and\n25\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and\nbulk purchasing.\nIn some countries, the proposed pricing for a biopharmaceutical product must be approved before it may\nbe lawfully marketed. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of biopharmaceutical products is\nsubject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. The requirements\ngoverning drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides\noptions for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health\ninsurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.\nAn EU member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, it may refuse to reimburse a\nproduct at the price set by the manufacturer or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls\non the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no\nassurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for biopharmaceutical\nproducts will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Innate's products.\nHistorically, biopharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures\nof the United States and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.\nThe Company believes that pricing pressures will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult\nfor it to sell any of its product candidates that may be approved in the future at a price acceptable to the\nCompany or any of its existing or future collaborators.\nAny of the Company's product candidates, if approved and commercialized, may fail to achieve market\nacceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community to a degree that is\nnecessary for commercial success.\nEven if the medical community accepts a product as safe and efficacious for its indicated use, physicians\nmay choose to restrict the use of the product if the Company is unable to demonstrate that, based on\nexperience, clinical data, side-effect profiles and other factors, its drug is preferable to any existing drugs\nor treatments. The Company cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of any product candidate that\nwill receive marketing authorization, which will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited\nto:\n• the demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the drug;\n• the approved labeling for the drug and any required warnings;\n• prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n• the advantages and disadvantages of the drug compared to alternative treatments;\n• ease of the drug’s use;\n• its ability to educate the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of the drug;\n• the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n• publicity about its product or about competitive products;\n• the coverage and reimbursement policies of government and commercial third-party payors\npertaining to the drug;\n• the market price of its drugs relative to competing treatments; and\n• due to the rarity of orphan diseases, it could be difficult finding patients seeking treatment.\nPoor market penetration could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n26\nInnate's commercial experience is currently limited to Lumoxiti. Although Lumoxiti received a Marketing\nAuthorization in 2018 in the United States, the level of sales in 2020 was lower than expected, leading\nInnate to make the decision in December 2020 to return the commercial rights of Lumoxiti to\nAstraZeneca. Beyond the financial impacts, the direct consequence of this decision was the immediate\nreduction of commercial operations in the Company's U.S. affiliate. A retrospective analysis identified\ntwo major causes: (i) a more complex patient access than expected due to geographic dispersion and (ii)\nthe global pandemic of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly limited interactions with\nprescribing physicians. Moreover, the indolent and non-fatal nature of hairy cell leukemia in the short\nterm encouraged physicians to delay or cancel treatment for some patients during the pandemic. This\nretrospective analysis of its commercial experience will help Innate Pharma capitalize on this experience\nfor future registration and commercialization of its drug candidates.\nEven if some of its product candidates receive marketing authorization, the terms of such approval,\nongoing regulation and potential post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market may limit\nhow the drug may be marketed and may subject the Company to penalties for failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements, which could impair its ability to generate revenues.\nEven if any of its product candidates receives a marketing authorization, such approval may carry\nconditions that limit the market for the drug or put the drug at a competitive disadvantage relative to\nalternative therapies. Regulators may limit the marketing of products to particular indications or patient\npopulations. Regulators may require warning labels, and drugs with warnings are subject to more\nrestrictive marketing regulations than drugs without such warnings. These restrictions could make it more\ndifficult to market any drug effectively. Marketing restrictions may reduce the revenue that the Company\nis able to obtain.\nAny of its product candidates for which the Company obtains marketing authorization, and the\nmanufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional\nactivities for such products, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review\nby the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety\nand other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements\nrelating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records\nand documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even\nif marketing authorization of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on\nthe indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the\nFDA requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of a\ndrug or biological product outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA, EMA and other national authorities may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing\nstudies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product, such as long-term\nobservational studies on natural exposure. The FDA and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of\nJustice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure\nthat they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance\nwith the provisions of the approved labeling. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with\nInnate's product candidates or with manufacturing processes, including adverse events of unanticipated\nseverity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the\napproved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to\nassess new safety risks, or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions including suspension of\nproduction and/or distribution and withdrawal of regulatory approvals. Failure to comply with these\nrequirements may lead to financial penalties, compliance expenditures, total or partial suspension of\nproduction and/or distribution, product seizure or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of\n27\nproducts, suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of a company’s submissions, enforcement\nactions, product recalls, injunctions and even criminal prosecution, any of which could materially and\nadversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's future growth depends, in part, on its ability to penetrate multiple markets, in which\nthe Company would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nInnate's future profitability will depend, in part, on its ability to commercialize its product candidates, if\napproved, in markets in Europe, the United States and other countries where the Company maintains\ncommercialization rights. If the Company commercializes its product candidates, if approved, in multiple\nmarkets, the Company would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;\n• economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular economies and\nmarkets;\n• potentially adverse and/or unexpected tax consequences, including penalties due to the failure\nof tax planning or due to the challenge by tax authorities on the basis of transfer pricing and\nliabilities imposed from inconsistent enforcement;\n• the burden of complying with complex and changing regulatory, tax, accounting and legal\nrequirements, many of which vary between countries;\n• different medical practices and customs in multiple countries affecting acceptance of drugs in\nthe marketplace;\n• differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and\nprice controls;\n• tariffs, trade barriers, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions;\n• compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or\ntraveling abroad;\n• workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is common;\n• reduced or loss of protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and\nrelated prevalence of generic alternatives to therapeutics; and\n• becoming subject to the different, complex and changing laws, regulations and court systems\nof multiple jurisdictions and compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and\nregulations.\nThe conflict in Middle East and the Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine may affect regional stability\nand economic growth throughout Europe. These and other risks associated with international operations\nmay adversely affect Innate's ability to attain or maintain profitable operations. Future sales of the\nCompany's product candidates, if they are approved, will be dependent on purchasing decisions of and\nreimbursement from government health administration authorities, distributors and other organizations.\nAs a result of adverse conditions affecting the global economy and credit and financial markets, including\ndisruptions due to political instability or otherwise, these organizations may defer purchases, may be\nunable to satisfy their purchasing or reimbursement obligations, or may affect milestone payments or\nroyalties for monalizumab or any of Innate's product candidates that are approved for commercialization\nin the future. Should any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate\nPharma's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n28\nEven if its product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they will be subject to continuous regulatory\nreview.\nIf marketing authorization is obtained for any of its product candidates, the candidate will remain subject\nto continuous review, and therefore authorization could be subsequently withdrawn or restricted. The\nCompany will be subject to ongoing obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities, including adverse\nevent reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and, potentially, other post-marketing obligations, all\nof which may result in significant expense and limit its ability to commercialize such products.\nIf there are changes in the application of legislation or regulatory policies, or if problems are discovered\nwith a product or its manufacture of a product, or if the Company or one of its distributors, licensees or\nco-marketers fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the regulators could take various actions.\nThese include imposing fines on us, imposing restrictions on the product or its manufacture and requiring\nInnate to recall or remove the product from the market. The regulators could also suspend or withdraw\ntheir marketing authorizations, requiring Innate to conduct additional clinical studies, change its product\nlabeling or submit additional applications for marketing authorization. If any of these events occurs, its\nability to sell such product may be impaired, and the Company may incur substantial additional expense\nto comply with regulatory requirements, which could materially adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nEven if one of its product candidates has orphan drug designation, the Company may not be able to\nobtain any benefit from such designation. Furthermore, if a product is granted orphan drug exclusivity\nin the same indication for which the Company is developing lacutamab or its other product candidates\nthat is granted orphan drug designation, the Company may not be able to have its product candidate\napproved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs\nfor relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may\ndesignate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition,\nwhich is generally defined as a disease that affects a patient population of fewer than 200,000 people in\nthe United States. In the European Union, the European Commission may designate a product candidate\nas an orphan medicinal product if it is a medicine for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-\nthreatening or very serious conditions that affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European\nUnion, or it is unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the\ninvestment needed for its development. Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation\nreceives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is\nentitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the FDA\nfrom approving the marketing application of another drug for the same indication for that time period or\nprecludes the EMA, and other national drug regulators in the European Union, from accepting the\nmarketing application for another medicinal product for the same indication. The applicable period is\nseven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The European Union period can be\nreduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product\nis profitable enough that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost in\nthe United States if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the\nmanufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the\nrare disease or condition. The granting of a request for orphan drug designation does not alter the standard\nregulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval.\nLacutamab has been granted orphan drug designation for cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) in Europe\nand in the United States, and the Company may pursue orphan drug designation for another product\ncandidate that the Company may develop in the future in the United States and/or Europe. However, there\nis no assurance the Company will be able to receive orphan drug designation for other product candidates\n29\nthat the Company may develop in the United States and/or Europe or for any other product candidate in\nany jurisdiction. Even if the Company is successful in obtaining orphan drug designation, orphan drug\nstatus may not ensure that the Company has market exclusivity in a particular market. Even if the\nCompany obtains orphan drug exclusivity for any of its product candidates, that exclusivity may not\neffectively protect the product from competition because exclusivity can be suspended under certain\ncircumstances. In the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently\napprove another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior\nin that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the\nEuropean Union, orphan exclusivity will not prevent a marketing authorization being granted for a similar\nmedicinal product in the same indication if the new product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically\nsuperior to the first product or if the marketing authorization holder of the first product is unable to supply\nsufficient quantities of the product. In addition, if another product is granted marketing approval and\norphan drug exclusivity in the same indication for which the Company is developing a product candidate\nwith orphan drug designation, the Company may not be able to have its product candidate approved by\nthe applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nA fast track, breakthrough therapy or other designation by the FDA, or equivalent in other territories,\nmay not actually lead to a faster development.\nThe Company may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy or similar designation for its product candidates.\nIf a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product\ndemonstrates the potential to address unmet medical need for this condition, the sponsor may apply for\nFDA fast track designation. The Company has received fast track designation in the U.S. and PRIME\ndesignation in the EU for lacutamab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary\nSyndrome (SS) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.\nAdditionally, the Company may in the future seek a breakthrough therapy designation or an equivalent in\nother territories for some of its product candidates that reach the regulatory review process. A\nbreakthrough therapy is a drug candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other\ndrugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and that, as indicated by preliminary\nclinical evidence, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more\nclinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical\ndevelopment. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are eligible for accelerated\napproval and increased interaction and communication with the FDA designed to expedite the\ndevelopment and review process.\nHowever, these designations do not ensure that the Company will experience a faster development\nprocess, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may\nwithdraw a designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from its clinical\ndevelopment program. A designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA’s priority review\nprocedures.\nPriority review designation by the FDA, or the equivalent in other territories, may not lead to a faster\nregulatory review or approval process and, in any event, does not assure FDA approval of Innate's\nproduct candidates.\nIf the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment\nwhere no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A\npriority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather\nthan the standard review period of 10 months. The Company may request priority review for its product\ncandidates. The FDA has broad discretion with respect to whether or not to grant priority review status to\na product candidate, so even if the Company believes a particular product candidate is eligible for such\n30\ndesignation or status, the FDA may decide not to grant it. Moreover, a priority review designation does\nnot necessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect\nto approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Receiving priority review from the FDA does not\nguarantee approval within the six-month review cycle or thereafter.\nThe Company is subject to healthcare laws and regulations which may require substantial compliance\nefforts and could expose Innate to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages,\nreputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings, among other penalties.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription\nof biologic products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-\nparty payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims\nlaws, transparency laws, patient data privacy laws, regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations\nthat may constrain the business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and\nstate healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n• the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from\nknowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly\nor indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the\npurchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in\nwhole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n• the U.S. civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil\nmonetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things,\nknowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment\nthat are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a\nfalse record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal\ngovernment;\n• the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created\nadditional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully\nexecuting, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or\nmaking false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n• HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health\nAct, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published\nin January 2013, which impose obligations on covered entities and their business associates,\nincluding mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and\ntransmission of individually identifiable health information;\n• the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act,\nunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education\nReconciliation Act, or the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics\nand medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\nwithin the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to\npayments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as\nwell as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family\nmembers; and\n• analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims\nlaws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental\nthird-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies\nto comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant\n31\ncompliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring\nmanufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care\nproviders or marketing expenditures. Certain state laws require the reporting of information\nrelating to drug and biologic pricing; and some state and local laws require the registration of\npharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security\nof health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant\nways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEnsuring that Innate's business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws\nand regulations will likely be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that its\nbusiness practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving\napplicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If Innate Pharma's operations were\nfound to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us,\nthe Company may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines,\ndisgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if the Company becomes subject\nto a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with\nthese laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and\ncurtailment of its operations, any of which could substantially disrupt its operations. If the physicians or\nother providers or entities with whom the Company expects to do business are found not to be in\ncompliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions,\nincluding exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Should any of these risks materialize,\nthis could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nEuropean data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the collection, use,\nprocessing and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nThe Company may collect, process, use or transfer personal information from individuals located in the\nEuropean Union in connection with its business, including in connection with conducting clinical studies\nin the European Union. The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union are\ngoverned by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR). This\nlegislation imposes requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information\nrelating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside of the European Economic\nArea (EEA), including to the United States, providing details to those individuals regarding the\nprocessing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing\nagreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals’ requests to\nexercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving\npersonal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data\nprotection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments and record-keeping. The GDPR\napplies across the European Economic Area (EEA) and, by virtue of the GDPR as it forms part of United\nKingdom law, in a broadly uniform manner through section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act\n2018, or the UK GDPR, in the United Kingdom. However, the GDPR provides that EEA member states\ncan make their own further laws and regulations to introduce specific requirements related to the\nprocessing of \"special categories of personal data\", including personal data related to health, biometric\ndata used for unique identification purposes and genetic information; as well as personal data related to\ncriminal offenses or convictions – in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018\ncomplements the UK GDPR in this regard. This fact may lead to greater divergence on the law that\napplies to the processing of such data types across the EEA and/or United Kingdom, compliance with\nwhich, as and where applicable, may increase the Company's costs and could increase its overall\n32\ncompliance risk. Such country-specific regulations could also limit its ability to collect, use and share data\nin the context of the Company's EEA and/or United Kingdom establishments (regardless of where any\nprocessing in question occurs), and/or could cause its compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an\nadverse impact on Innate's business and harming its business and financial condition. Failure to comply\nwith the requirements of the GDPR and related national data protection laws of the member states of the\nEuropean Union may result in substantial fines, other administrative penalties and civil claims being\nbrought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Moreover, in some European countries, including France, there are\nadditional obligations applicable to the processing of personal data for the purpose of research in the field\nof healthcare and the hosting of personal health data must be carried out by specifically certified hosting\nservice providers. Non-compliance with such additional rules as well as the absence or suspension of the\nappropriate certification of such hosting service provider may adversely affect Innate Pharma's business,\nor even lead to penalties related to breach of security of personal data.\nRisks Related to Innate's Reliance on Third Parties\nThe Company has no manufacturing capabilities and relies on third-party manufacturers for its\nproduct candidates.\nInnate Pharma's product candidates that are tested during its preclinical and clinical studies are\nmanufactured by third parties. The Company has no production capabilities and relies on third parties to\nmanufacture its products.\nThis strategy means that the Company does not directly control certain key aspects of its product\ndevelopment, such as:\n• the quality of the product manufactured;\n• the delivery times for drugs for a given clinical trial;\n• the clinical and commercial quantities that can be supplied; and\n• compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIts reliance on third-party manufacturers creates risks that may not exist if the Company had its own\nmanufacturing capabilities. These risks include:\n• failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with regulatory and quality control standards;\n• production of insufficient quantities;\n• damage during transport and/or storage of its product candidates;\n• breach of agreements by third-party manufacturers; and\n• termination or non-renewal of the agreements for reasons beyond its control.\nShould its third-party manufacturers breach their obligations or should the Company fails to renew its\ncontracts with them, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to find new suppliers within a\ntimeframe and under conditions that would not be detrimental. The Company could also be faced with\ndelays or interruptions in its supplies, which could result in a delay in the clinical trials and, ultimately, a\ndelay in the commercialization of the product candidates that the Company is developing. For example,\nmanufacturing issues, leading to out-of-specification product, can occur during a manufacturing campaign\nat the Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) in charge of the production of its product candidates.\n33\nReproducing a batch of product is a lengthy and costly process and sometimes can lead to drug shortage\nthat can in turn lead to a delay in the development of the candidate, or even an early stop of a clinical trial.\nThis happened in the early clinical development of lacutamab and led to the decision to limit the number\nof patients in order to ensure drug supply for treated patients in the Phase 1 clinical study.\nFor example, in November 2019, Impletio Wirkstoffabfüllung GmbH (formerly known as Rentschler Fill\nSolutions GmbH), the subcontractor in charge of the fill-and-finish manufacturing operations of\nlacutamab, unilaterally decided to withdraw the certificates of conformance of all clinical batches\nproduced at their facilities, including the lacutamab batch used for the TELLOMAK Phase 2 clinical\nstudy assessing lacutamab in multiple indications. Impletio Wirkstoffabfüllung GmbH decided to\nwithdraw the certificates of conformance even though the compliance of its manufacturing site with Good\nManufacturing Practices had been confirmed by two on-site inspections performed by the Austrian Health\nAgency before and after the Company began to work with them.\nThe transfer of the manufacturing process to another contract manufacturing organization took a few\nmonths and came with additional costs but allowed Innate to have a conform batch in the middle of 2020\nand to resume the enrollment and treatment of patients in the clinical trials after getting Regulatory\nAgencies' approval. During this period of time, the TELLOMAK trial was on partial or full hold in the\nUnited States, Spain, Germany and Italy.\nShould any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is reliant upon third parties to manufacture and supply components of certain\nsubstances necessary to manufacture its product candidates.\nThe Company is reliant on several third-party CMOs for the manufacture and supply of components and\nsubstances for all of the product candidates the Company is developing. In addition, certain component\nmaterials are currently available from a single supplier, or a small number of suppliers. The Company\ncannot be sure that these suppliers will remain in business, or that they will not be purchased by one of its\ncompetitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to manufacture these materials for us.\nThe Company cannot assure that, if required, the Company will be able to identify alternate sources with\nthe desired scale and capability and establish relationships with such sources. A loss of any CMO or\ncomponent supplier and delay in establishing a replacement could delay Innate's clinical development and\nregulatory approval process.\nIts production costs may be higher than the Company currently estimates.\nInnate's product candidates are manufactured according to manufacturing best practices applicable to\ndrugs for clinical trials and to specifications approved by the applicable regulatory authorities. If any of\nits products were found to be non-compliant, the Company would be required to manufacture the product\nagain, which would entail additional costs and may prevent delivery of the product to patients on time.\nOther risks inherent in the production process may have the same effect, such as:\n• contamination of the controlled atmosphere area;\n• unusable premises and equipment;\n• new regulatory requirements requiring a partial and/or extended stop to the production unit to\nmeet the requirements;\n• unavailable qualified personnel;\n• power failure of extended duration; and\n34\n• logistical error.\nShould any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect its business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on third parties to supply key materials used in its research and development, to\nprovide services to Innate and to assist with clinical studies.\nThe Company makes considerable use of third-party suppliers for the key materials used in its business.\nThe failure of third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory standards could result in the imposition of\nsanctions on the Company. These sanctions could include fines, injunctions, civil penalties, refusal by\nregulatory organizations to grant approval to conduct clinical trials or marketing authorization for its\nproducts, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizure or recalls of its\nproducts, operating restrictions and legal proceedings. Furthermore, the presence of non-conformities, as\ndetected in regulatory toxicology studies, could result in delays in the development of one or more of its\nproduct candidates and would require further tests to be financed. Although the Company is involved in\nestablishing the protocols for the production of these materials, the Company does not control all the\nstages of production and cannot guarantee that the third parties will fulfil their contractual and regulatory\nobligations. In particular, a partner’s failure to comply with protocols or regulatory constraints, or\nrepeated delays by a partner, could compromise the development of its products or limit its liability. Such\nevents could also inflate the product development costs incurred by us.\nThe Company also uses third parties to provide certain services such as scientific, medical or strategic\nconsultancy services. These service providers are generally selected for their specific expertise, as is the\ncase with the academic partners with whom the Company collaborates. To build and maintain such a\nnetwork under acceptable terms, the Company faces intense competition. Such external collaborators may\nterminate, at any time, their involvement. The Company can exert only limited control over their\nactivities. The Company may not be able to obtain the intellectual property rights to the product\ncandidates or technologies developed under collaboration, research and license agreements under\nacceptable terms or at all. Moreover, its scientific collaborators may assert intellectual property rights or\nother rights beyond the terms of their engagement.\nFinally, the Company uses third-party investigators to assist with conducting clinical trials. All clinical\ntrials are subject to strict regulations and quality standards. Should any of these risks materialize, this\ncould have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Company and its collaborators rely on third parties to conduct some of its preclinical clinical\nstudies and perform other clinical development tasks. If these third parties do not successfully carry out\ntheir contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply with regulatory requirements, it may not be\npossible to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, its product candidates, and its business\ncould be substantially harmed.\nThe Company has relied upon and plans to continue to rely upon third parties to conduct clinical studies\nof its product candidates or product candidates that the Company has licensed to partners. For example,\nunder its license and collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca is responsible for a number\nof clinical studies relating to monalizumab and IPH5201, which are subject to such agreements. In\naddition, the Company and its collaborators are responsible for and are supporting several clinical studies\nthat are sponsored by academic or research institutions, known as investigator-sponsored trials, as is the\ncase for the clinical study assessing IPH5301, which is sponsored by Institut Paoli-Calmettes and for the\nclinical study assessing lacutamab in PTCL, sponsored by the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA). By\ndefinition, the financing, design and conduct of an investigator-sponsored trial are the sole responsibility\nof the sponsor, and the Company or its collaborators, as applicable, have limited control over these\n35\naspects of these clinical trials, or the timing and reporting of the data from these trials. The Company and\nits collaborators also depend on independent clinical investigators and CROs to conduct clinical studies.\nCROs may also assist in the collection and analysis of data. There are a limited number of CROs that\nhave the expertise to run clinical studies of its product candidates. Identifying, qualifying and managing\nperformance of third-party service providers can be difficult and time consuming and can cause delays in\nits development programs. These investigators and CROs are not Innate's employees, and the Company is\nnot able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including the amount of time, that\nthey devote to Innate's product candidates and clinical studies. If the investigators sponsoring studies of\nits product candidates, independent investigators participating in clinical studies that Innate Pharma or its\ncollaborators are sponsoring or CROs fail to devote sufficient resources to its clinical studies and\ndevelopment of its product candidates or product candidates the Company has licensed to others, or if\ntheir performance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects for approval and\ncommercialization of any product candidates that the Company or its collaborators develop. In addition,\nthe use of third-party service providers requires Innate to disclose its proprietary information to these\nparties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated, and the Company may\nnot be able to obtain adequate remedies for such disclosure or misappropriation. Further, the FDA, EMA\nand other regulatory authorities require that the Company complies with standards, commonly referred to\nas Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and other local legal requirements, including data privacy regulations,\nfor conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible\nand accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial subjects are protected. If\nclinical investigators or CROs fail to meet their obligations to Innate or comply with GCP procedures or\nother applicable legal requirements, the data generated in these trials may be deemed unreliable, and the\nFDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require Innate to perform additional studies\nbefore approving Innate Pharma's marketing applications. The Company cannot assure that upon\ninspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that all of its clinical\ntrials comply with GCP regulations.\nIn addition, Innate's clinical studies must be conducted with product produced under current Good\nManufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The Company's failure to comply with these regulations may\nrequire the Company to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If\nclinical investigators or CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet\nexpected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is\ncompromised due to the failure to adhere to Innate's protocol or regulatory requirements, or for other\nreasons, its clinical trials or those of its collaborators may be extended, delayed or terminated, and the\nCompany or its collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully\ncommercialize its product candidates. As a result, its results of operations and the commercial prospects\nfor its product candidates would be harmed, its costs could increase and its ability to generate revenue\ncould be delayed.\nManufacturing facilities and clinical investigational sites are subject to significant government\nregulations and approvals, and if Innate's or its partners’ third-party manufacturers fail to comply\nwith these regulations or maintain these approvals, its business could be materially harmed.\nInnate's third-party manufacturers are subject to ongoing regulation and periodic inspection by national\nauthorities, including the EMA, FDA and other regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with cGMP, when\nproducing batches of its product candidates for clinical trials. CROs and other third-party research\norganizations must also comply with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) when carrying out regulatory\ntoxicology studies. Any failure to follow and document the Company's or third parties' adherence to such\nGMP and GLP regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the\n36\navailability of products for commercial sale or clinical trials, may result in the termination of or a hold on\na clinical trial, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for its products.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in national authorities, the EMA, FDA or\nother applicable regulatory authorities taking various actions, including:\n• levying fines and other civil penalties;\n• imposing consent decrees or injunctions;\n• requiring Innate to suspend or put on hold one or more of its clinical trials;\n• suspending or withdrawing regulatory approvals;\n• delaying or refusing to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n• requiring Innate Pharma to suspend manufacturing activities or product sales, imports or\nexports;\n• requiring Innate to communicate with physicians and other customers about concerns related\nto actual or potential safety, efficacy and other issues involving its products;\n• mandating product recalls or seizing products;\n• imposing operating restrictions; and\n• seeking criminal prosecutions.\nAny of the foregoing actions could be detrimental to Innate's reputation, business, financial condition or\noperating results. Furthermore, its key suppliers may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable\nregulatory requirements, which could result in its failure to produce its products on a timely basis and in\nthe required quantities, if at all. In addition, before any additional products would be considered for\nmarketing authorization in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, its suppliers will have to pass an\ninspection by the applicable regulatory agencies. The Company is dependent on its suppliers’ cooperation\nand ability to pass such inspections, and the inspections and any necessary remediation may be costly.\nFailure to pass such inspections by Innate Pharma or any of its suppliers would affect its ability to\ncommercialize its product candidates in Europe, the United States or elsewhere. Should any of these risks\nmaterialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations. For example, in November 2019, Impletio Wirkstoffabfüllung GmbH\n(formerly known as Rentschler Fill Solutions GmbH), the subcontractor in charge of the fill-and-finish\nmanufacturing operations of lacutamab, unilaterally decided to withdraw the certificates of conformance\nof all clinical batches produced at their facilities, including the lacutamab batch used for the TELLOMAK\nPhase 2 clinical study assessing lacutamab in multiple indications, which resulted in partial or full holds\nin a number of countries, which have since been resolved.\nThe Company depends upon its existing collaboration partners, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and other third\nparties, and may depend upon future collaboration partners to commit to the research, development,\nmanufacturing and marketing of its drugs.\nThe Company has significant collaborations with AstraZeneca for the development of monalizumab,\nIPH5201 and other product candidates. The Company also collaborates with Sanofi for the development\nof IPH6101/SAR'579, IPH6401/SAR’514, IPH62 and IPH67 another program in solid tumors, and the\nCompany may enter into additional collaborations for other of its product candidates or technologies in\ndevelopment. The Company cannot control the timing or quantity of resources that its existing or future\ncollaborators will dedicate to research, preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing or marketing\nof its products. Innate's collaborators may not perform their obligations according to its expectations or\n37\nstandards of quality. Innate Pharma's collaborators could terminate its existing agreements for a number\nof reasons, including that they may have other, higher priority products in development or because its\npartnered programs may no longer be a priority for them. If any of the Company's collaboration\nagreements were to be terminated, the Company could encounter significant delays in developing its\nproduct candidates, lose the opportunity to earn any revenues Innate expected to generate under such\nagreements, incur unforeseen costs and suffer damage to the reputation of its product, product candidates\nand as a company generally.\nIn order to optimize the launch and market penetration of certain of its future product candidates, the\nCompany may enter into distribution and marketing agreements with pharmaceutical industry leaders. For\nthese product candidates, the Company would not market its products alone once they have obtained\nmarketing authorization. The risks inherent in entry into these contracts are as follows:\n• the negotiation and execution of these agreements is a long process that may not result in an\nagreement being signed or that can delay the development or commercialization of the product\ncandidate concerned;\n• these agreements are subject to cancellation or non-renewal by its collaborators or may not be\nfully complied with by its collaborators;\n• in the case of a license granted by us, the Company loses control of the development of the\nproduct candidate licensed; in such cases the Company would have only limited control over\nthe means and resources allocated by its partner for the commercialization of its product; and\n• collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce or defend Innate's intellectual\nproperty or proprietary rights or may use its proprietary information in such a way as to invite\nlitigation that could jeopardize or invalidate its proprietary information or expose the\nCompany to potential litigation.\nShould any of these risks materialize, or should the Company fails to find suitable collaborators, this\ncould have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe late-stage development and marketing of its product candidates may partially depend on its ability\nto establish collaborations with major biopharmaceutical companies.\nIn order to develop and market some of its product candidates, the Company relies on collaboration,\nresearch and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies to assist Innate in the development of\nproduct candidates and the financing of their development. For its most advanced clinical product\ncandidate, monalizumab, the Company entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca, in part because of\ntheir late-stage development and marketing capabilities. As the Company identifies new product\ncandidates, Innate Pharma will determine the appropriate strategy for development and marketing, which\nmay result in the need to establish collaborations with major biopharmaceutical companies. Innate may\nalso enter into agreements with institutions and universities to participate in its other research programs\nand to share intellectual property rights.\nThe Company may fail to find collaboration partners and to sign new agreements for its other product\ncandidates and programs. The competition for partners is intense, and the negotiation process is time-\nconsuming and complex. Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and the\nCompany may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example, development or approval of\na product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product candidate do not meet expectations or the\ncollaborator terminates the collaboration. Any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, may\nrequire Innate to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase Innate's near- and long-term expenditures\nand pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt its management or business.\n38\nThese transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown\nliabilities; disruption of Innate's business and diversion of its management’s time and attention in order to\nmanage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies; incurrence of\nsubstantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs; higher\nthan expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs; write-downs of assets or goodwill or\nimpairment charges; increased amortization expenses; difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration\nor combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business; and impairment of relationships with\nkey suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and\nownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business. Accordingly, although there\ncan be no assurance that the Company will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the\nnature described above, any transactions that the Company does complete may be subject to the foregoing\nor other risks and have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any additional collaboration or other strategic\ntransaction that would be beneficial to Innate could delay the development and potential\ncommercialization of its product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any\nproduct candidate that reaches market.\nThe Company does not and will not have access to all information regarding its product candidates\nthat are subject to collaboration and license agreements. Consequently, its ability to inform its\nshareholders about the status of product candidates that are subject to these agreements, and its ability\nto make business and operational decisions, may be limited.\nInnate does not and will not have access to all information regarding its product candidates that are\nsubject to its license and collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and other third parties,\nincluding potentially material information about clinical trial design, execution and timing, safety and\nefficacy, clinical trial results, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing and other areas known by its\ncollaborators. In addition, the Company has confidentiality obligations under its collaboration and license\nagreements. Therefore, its ability to keep its shareholders informed about the status of product candidates\nsubject to such agreements will be limited by the degree to which its collaborators keep Innate informed\nand allow Innate Pharma to disclose information to the public or provide such information to the public\nthemselves. If its collaborators do not inform Innate about its product candidates subject to agreements\nwith them, the Company may make operational and investment decisions that the Company would not\nhave made had the Company been fully informed, which may have an adverse impact on its business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Innate Pharma's Financial Position and Capital Needs\nThe Company has incurred and may in the future incur significant operational losses related to its\nresearch and development activities.\nThe Company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception except for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2018. Innate's net income (loss) was €(7.6) million and €(58.1) million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Substantially all of its net losses resulted from\ncosts incurred in connection with its development programs and from selling, general and administrative\nexpenses associated with its ongoing operations. The Company expects to incur significant expenses and\noperating losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company had one product, Lumoxiti, that has received regulatory approval for sale or has generated\nrevenues from commercial sales, and none of its other product candidates have received regulatory\napproval. Unless this happens, the likelihood and amount of its future operational losses will depend on\nseveral factors, including the pace and amount of its future expenditures in connection with its product\n39\ncandidates and development programs and its ability to obtain funding through milestone or royalty\npayments under its license and collaboration agreements, equity or debt financings, strategic\ncollaborations and government grants and tax credits. The Company expects that its main source of\nincome for the near- and medium-term will be:\n• payments received under its license and collaboration agreements with third parties, including\nAstraZeneca and Sanofi; and\n• government grants and research tax credits.\nThe interruption of one or more of those sources of income could have a material adverse effect on\nInnate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's ability to be profitable in the future will depend on its ability to generate revenue from\nsales relating to its product candidates, if approved, and its ability to obtain regulatory approval for\nmarketing its product candidates. If its product candidates receive regulatory approval, its future revenues\nwill depend upon the size of any markets in which its product candidates have received approval, and\nmarket acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and market share. Any of these factors could\nhave a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Company may need to raise additional funding to complete the development and any\ncommercialization of its product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all,\nand failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force it to delay, limit or terminate its\nproduct development efforts or other operations.\nInnate Pharma is currently advancing its product candidates through preclinical and clinical development,\nand anticipates relying on partners as the Company advances them. Innate currently retains the full\ndevelopment and marketing rights to lacutamab, IPH5301 and IPH6501 and may retain rights to\nadditional proprietary product candidates in the future. The development of immunotherapy product\ncandidates is expensive, and Innate expects its research and development expenses to increase as the\nCompany advances its product candidates through clinical studies and regulatory approvals. If clinical\nstudies are successful and if Innate obtains regulatory approval for product candidates that the Company\ndevelops, Innate expects to incur commercialization expenses before these product candidates are\nmarketed and sold.\nThe Company anticipates that its expenses will increase substantially if and as it:\n• continues its research, preclinical and clinical development of its product candidates if its\ncurrent collaboration partners cease their collaborations with us;\n• expands the scope of its current clinical studies for its product candidates;\n• initiates additional preclinical, clinical or other studies for its product candidates;\n• further develops manufacturing processes for its product candidates;\n• changes or adds additional manufacturers or suppliers;\n• seeks regulatory and marketing authorizations for its product candidates that successfully\ncomplete clinical studies;\n• establishes a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product for\nwhich the Company may obtain marketing authorization;\n• seeks to identify and validate additional product candidates that may result in additional\npreclinical, clinical or other product studies;\n40\n• acquires or in-license agreements or other product candidates and technologies;\n• makes milestone or other payments under any in-license agreements;\n• maintains, protects, defends and expands its intellectual property portfolio;\n• attracts and retains new and existing skilled personnel;\n• creates additional infrastructure to support its operations as a public company in the United\nStates following the completion of the October 2019 global offering; and\n• experiences any delays or encounters issues with any of the above.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and non-\ncurrent financial assets of €102.3 million. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and non-current financial assets, together with its cash flow from operations, will be\nsufficient to fund its operations for the next two years. However, in order to complete the development\nprocess, obtain regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize its product candidates that the\nCompany is developing in-house, including lacutamab, IPH5301 and IPH6501; develop its proprietary\ntechnology; and develop a pipeline of additional product candidates, the Company will require additional\nfunding. Innate's existing resources may not be sufficient to cover any additional financing needs, in\nwhich case new funding would be required. See “—the Company has incurred and may in the future incur\nsignificant operational losses related to its research and development activities.” The conditions and\narrangements for such new financing would depend, among other factors, on economic and market\nconditions that are beyond its control, including the current volatility in the capital markets.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert Innate's management from their day-to-day activities, which\nmay adversely affect the Company's ability to develop and commercialize its product candidates. In\naddition, the Company cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on\nterms acceptable to us, if at all. Under French law, Innate's share capital may be increased only with\nshareholders’ approval at an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting on the basis of a report from the\nExecutive Board. In addition, the French Commercial Code imposes certain limitations on Innate's ability\nto price certain offerings of its share capital without preferential subscription rights (droit préférentiel de\nsouscription), which limitation may prevent Innate from successfully completing any such offering.\nMoreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of Innate's\nshareholders, and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of\nsuch issuance, may cause the market price of its ordinary shares or the ADSs to decline. The sale of\nadditional equity or convertible securities would dilute its shareholders. The Company may seek funds\nthrough arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage of product development\nthan otherwise would be desirable, and the Company may be required to relinquish rights to some of its\ntechnologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to Innate Pharma, any of\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf the Company needs and is unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, the Company may be required to\nsignificantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of its research or development programs or the\ncommercialization of any product or product candidate, or the Company may be unable to expand its\noperations or otherwise capitalize on its business opportunities as desired, which could impair its growth\nprospects. Should any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n41\nThe terms of Innate's loans agreements with Société Générale, BNP Paribas and certain other loan\nobligations place restrictions on its operating and financial flexibility.\nIn July 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Société Générale (the “Loan\nAgreement”) in order to finance the construction of its future headquarters. The Loan Agreement is\nsecured by collateral in the form of financial instruments valued at €15.2 million held at Société Générale.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Innate Pharma had drawn down €15.2 million under the Loan Agreement. The\nLoan Agreement subjects Innate to a covenant to maintain a minimum balance of its total cash, cash\nequivalents and current and non-current financial assets as of each fiscal year end at least equal to the\namount of outstanding principal under the Loan Agreement. Compliance with this covenant may limit its\nflexibility in operating its business and its ability to take actions that might be advantageous to Innate and\nits shareholders. For example, if the Company fails to meet its minimum cash covenant and Innate is\nunable to raise additional funds or obtain a waiver or other amendment to the Loan Agreement, Innate\nPharma may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate certain of its clinical development efforts.\nAdditionally, Innate may be required to repay the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness under the\nLoan Agreement in cash if the Company fails to stay in compliance with its covenant or suffer some other\nevent of default under the Loan Agreement. Under the Loan Agreement, an event of default will occur if,\namong other things, Innate fails to make payments under the Loan Agreement or Innate breaches its\ncovenant under the Loan Agreement. The Company may not have enough available cash or be able to\nraise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such\nevent of default occurs. In that case, Innate may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its clinical\ndevelopment efforts or grant rights to others to develop and market product candidates that the Company\nwould otherwise prefer to develop and market itself. Société Générale could also exercise its rights as\ncollateral agent to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the loan for its benefit. Innate's\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed as a result of any of\nthese events.\nOn January 5, 2022, the Company announced that it had obtained €28.7 million in non-dilutive financing\nin the form of two State Guaranteed Loans from Société Générale (€20.0 million) and BNP Paribas\n(€8.7 million). The Company received the funds related to these two loans on December 27 and 30, 2021,\nrespectively. Both loans have an initial maturity of one year with an option to extend to five years. They\nare 90% guaranteed by the French government as part of the package of measures put in place by the\nFrench government to support companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effective interest rate\napplied to these contracts is 0.5%, which is the contractual rate for repayment within one year.\nOn August 2022, the Company requested the extension repayment of the non-dilutive financing of €28.7\nmillion obtained in December 2021 in the form of two State Guaranteed Loans ( “PGE”), respectively, for\n20.0 and 8.7 million euros for an additional period of five years starting in 2022 and including a one-year\ngrace period. Consequently, the Company has obtained agreements from Société Générale and BNP\nParibas. The effective interest rates applied to these contracts during the additional period are 1.56% and\n0.95% for Société Générale and BNP Paribas loans, respectively, excluding insurance and guarantee fees,\nwith an amortization exemption for the entire year 2023. During this grace period, the Company will only\nbe liable for the payment of interest and the guarantee fees, with amortization of the two loans starting in\n2024 over a period of four years.\n42\nIf Innate does not achieve its product development or commercialization objectives in the timeframes\nInnate expects, the Company may not receive product revenue or milestone or royalty payments, and\nInnate Pharma may not be able to conduct its operations as planned.\nInnate has received and expects to continue to receive payments from its collaborators when the Company\nsatisfies certain pre-specified milestones in its licensing or collaboration agreements. Innate Pharma\ncurrently depends to a large degree on these milestone payments from its existing collaborators in order to\nfund its operations, and Innate may enter into new collaboration agreements that also provide for\nmilestone payments. For example, the Company has granted options to license or acquire intellectual\nproperty rights in certain of its programs to its collaborators which, if exercised, will result in up-front\noption exercise fees and, assuming Innate meets all specified development, clinical, regulatory and sales\nmilestones, could result in substantial milestone payments. These milestone payments are generally\ndependent on the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, sales and other product\ndevelopment objectives, and the successful or timely achievement of many of these milestones is outside\nof its control, in part because some of these activities are being or will be conducted by its collaborators.\nIf Innate or its collaborators fail to achieve the applicable milestones, Innate Pharma may not receive such\nmilestone payments. A failure to receive any such milestone payment may cause Innate to:\n• delay, reduce or terminate certain research and development programs;\n• reduce headcount;\n• raise funds through additional equity or convertible debt financings that could be dilutive to its\nshareholders and holders of its ADSs;\n• obtain funds through collaboration agreements that may require Innate to assign rights to\ntechnologies or products that Innate would have otherwise retained;\n• sign new collaboration or license agreements that may be less favorable than those the\nCompany would have obtained under different circumstances; and\n• consider strategic transactions or engaging in a joint venture with a third party.\nIn addition, although Innate may be eligible to receive an aggregate of approximately $3.9 billion in\nfuture contingent payments from existing collaboration agreements and any license agreements that\nbecome effective upon the exercise by its collaborators of options to license future product candidates,\nthere is no guarantee that the Company will receive any contingent payments or that its collaborators will\nexercise any options to license or acquire additional intellectual property rights in any of its programs. If\nits collaborators decide not to exercise such options with respect to a program, the Company will not\nreceive the up-front option exercise fee and will not be eligible to receive any of the related commercial,\ndevelopment, royalty or other milestone payments. Even if its collaborators exercise such options with\nrespect to a particular program, Innate Pharma may never achieve the related milestones for any number\nof reasons. The failure to receive milestone or royalty payments and the occurrence of any of the events\nabove may have a material adverse impact on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nThe revenues generated from its collaboration and license agreements have contributed and are\nexpected to contribute a large portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has entered into collaboration and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies,\nincluding AstraZeneca and Sanofi. The upfront payments and milestones received from its partners were\n€31.6 million, €56.9 million and €10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n43\nInnate also enhances its research efforts by establishing collaborations with academic or non-profit\nresearch institutions and other biopharmaceutical companies. The participation in these collaborations\nmay generate revenue and funding in the form of operating grants or the reimbursement of research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nInnate Pharma may not be able to renew or maintain its license agreements or collaborative research\ncontracts or may be unable to sign new agreements with new collaborators on reasonable terms or at all.\nThe early termination of a contract, the non-renewal of a contract or its inability to find new collaborators\nwould adversely affect its business. Should any of these risks materialize, this could have an adverse\neffect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company benefits from tax credits in France that could be reduced or eliminated.\nAs a French biopharmaceutical company, Innate benefits from certain tax advantages, including the\nResearch Tax Credit (Crédit Impôt Recherche), which is a French tax credit aiming at stimulating\nresearch and development. The Research Tax Credit is calculated based on Innate's claimed amount of\neligible research and development expenditures in France and represented €9.7 million, €7.9 million and\n€10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Research Tax\nCredit is a source of financing to Innate that could be reduced or eliminated by the French tax authorities\nor by changes in French tax law or regulations.\nThe Research Tax Credit can be offset against French corporate income tax due by the company with\nrespect to the year during which the eligible research and development expenditures have been made. The\nportion of tax credit in excess which is not being offset, if any, represents a receivable against the French\nTreasury which can in principle be offset against the French corporate income tax due by the company\nwith respect to the three following years. The remaining portion of tax credit not being offset upon expiry\nof such a period may then be refunded to the company.\nAs soon as the Company qualifies as small- and medium-size business, the French Treasury refunds\nimmediately (meaning that, in practice, Innate can receive the refund during the year following the year in\nwhich the eligible research and development expenditures are made) the Research Tax Credit claims. If\nthe Company does not qualify for this status, the Research Tax Credit claims will be reimbursed within\nthe expiry of a period of three years. The history of the Company's status and of the incomes related to the\nResearch Tax Credit is detailed in the Notes to financial statements, section 2), paragraph q) of the\npresent document.\nThe French tax authorities, with the assistance of the Higher Education and Research Ministry, may audit\neach research and development program in respect of which a Research Tax Credit benefit has been\nclaimed and assess whether such program qualifies in their view for the Research Tax Credit benefit. The\nFrench tax authorities may challenge Innate's eligibility for, or its calculation of, certain tax reductions or\ndeductions in respect of its research and development activities (and therefore the amount of Research\nTax Credit claimed), or the accelerated reimbursement allowed for small- and medium-size businesses\nand the Company's credits may be reduced, which would have a negative impact on its revenue and future\ncash flows.\nFurthermore, the French Parliament may decide to eliminate, or to reduce the scope or the rate of, the\nResearch Tax Credit benefit, either of which it could decide to do at any time. If Innate fails to receive\nfuture Research Tax Credit amounts or if its calculations are challenged, even if Innate Pharma complies\nwith the current requirements in terms of documentation and eligibility of its expenditure, its business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n44\nThe Company may be unable to carry forward existing tax losses.\nInnate has accumulated tax loss carry forwards of €483.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Applicable\nFrench law provides that, for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2012, the use of these tax losses is\nlimited to €1.0 million, plus 50% of the portion of net earnings exceeding this amount. The unused\nbalance of the tax losses in application of such rule can be carried forward to future fiscal years, under the\nsame conditions and without time restriction. There can be no assurance that future changes to applicable\ntax law and regulation will not eliminate or alter these or other provisions in a manner unfavorable to us,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows or\nresults of operations.\nInnate's business may be exposed to foreign exchange risks.\nThe Company incurs some of its expenses, and derives certain of its revenues, in currencies other than the\neuro. In particular, as Innate expands its operations and conducts additional clinical studies in the United\nStates, Innate will incur additional expenses in U.S. dollars. As a result, Innate is exposed to foreign\ncurrency exchange risk as its results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nThe Company currently does not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future\nexchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the euro. Therefore, an unfavorable change in\nthe value of the euro against the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on its revenue and earnings\ngrowth. Innate cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency\nfluctuations in the future may adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ADSs being offered in the U.S. offering are quoted in U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq, while Innate's\nordinary shares trade in euro on Euronext Paris. Innate's financial statements are prepared in euro.\nTherefore, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar will also affect, among\nother matters, the value of Innate's ordinary shares and ADSs.\nUnder Innate's license and collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, the payments the Company\nreceives are in U.S. dollars. The level of completion of the operations covered by this collaboration\nagreement is based on the costs converted at the historical exchange rate. The effects of reevaluation\ntherefore have no impact on the technical progress used for revenue recognition. Consequently, there may\nbe a difference between the level of completion that would take into account the last known rate and the\nlevel of completion as calculated. This difference could result in a future exchange gain or loss.\nMoreover, in the future, Innate could generate part of its sales in the United States and part in Europe and\ncould therefore be subject to an unfavorable euro/dollar exchange rate. Therefore, for example, an\nincrease in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar could be expected to have a negative impact on its\nrevenue and earnings growth as U.S. dollar revenue and earnings, if any, would be translated into euro at\na reduced value. The Company could also sign contracts denominated in other currencies, which would\nincrease its exposure to currency risk. In accordance with Innate's business decisions, its exposure to this\ntype of risk could change depending on:\n• the currencies in which Innate receives its revenues;\n• the currencies chosen when agreements are signed, such as licensing agreements, or co-\nmarketing or co-development agreements;\n• the location of clinical trials on product candidates; and\n• its policy for insurance cover.\n45\nAt present, Innate has not put any specific hedging arrangements in place to address these risks. Should\nany of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect Innate Pharma.\nThe Company is unable to predict what tax law may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect\nsuch changes would have on its business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax\nlegislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect its effective tax rates in the future in countries\nwhere it has operations and could have an adverse effect on its overall tax rate in the future, along with\nincreasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. The Company urges its shareholders and\nholders of its ADSs to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the potential tax\nconsequences of investing in or holding Innate's ordinary shares or ADSs.\nTax authorities may disagree with Innate's positions and conclusions regarding certain tax positions,\nresulting in unanticipated costs, taxes or non-realization of expected benefits.\nA tax authority may disagree with tax positions that the Company has taken, which could result in\nincreased tax liabilities. For example, the French tax authorities, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or\nanother tax authority could challenge Innate's allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts\npaid between its affiliated companies pursuant to its intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing\npolicies, including amounts paid with respect to its intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax\nauthority could assert that the Company is subject to tax in a jurisdiction where Innate believes it has not\nestablished a taxable connection, often referred to as a “permanent establishment” under international tax\ntreaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase the Company's expected tax liability in one or\nmore jurisdictions. A tax authority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and\npenalties are payable by us, in which case, the Company expects that it might contest such assessment.\nContesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly, and if Innate was unsuccessful in disputing the\nassessment, the result could increase its anticipated effective tax rate.\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Company went through tax inspections, in particular one tax inspection from the\nFrench tax authorities relating to 2018 to 2021 fiscal years resulted in an adjustment of €1.4 million. The\nfull details of the outcomes of this inspection are provided in the Notes to financial statements, section 13)\nof the present document.\nRisks Related to Innate Pharma's Organization and Operations\nIn the past there have been material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting and if Innate Pharma is unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial\nreporting, the accuracy and timeliness of its financial reporting may be adversely affected, which could\nhurt its business and/or lessen investor confidence.\nThe Company must maintain effective internal control processes over financial reporting in order to\naccurately report its results of operations and financial condition on a timely basis. A company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected\nby a company’s Executive Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,\nthat the Company assess the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of\n46\neach fiscal year. However, Innate's independent registered public auditor has not been required to attest to\nthe effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting for as long as the Company is an EGC,\ni.e., an “emerging growth company,” pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS\nAct). For more information, see “Item 3.D – Risk Factors—The Company is an “emerging growth\ncompany” under the JOBS Act and is able to avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to\nemerging growth companies, which can make its ordinary shares ADSs less attractive to investors. We\nmay lose this status from December 31, 2024 and will therefore incur additional expenses.\nIn this context, in order to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act within the prescribed\ntimeframe, and over the last five years, the Company has reinforced its internal control processes and has\nimplemented a standard and more robust Information System including an Enterprise Resource Planning\n(ERP) tool supporting the production and the management of its financial information. Some material\nweaknesses were identified as of December 31, 2020 and 2022.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is\na deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement in Innate's annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. These deficiencies concerned, respectively,\nprocess and controls relating to the processing of manual entries and significant and unusual transactions,\nand controls aimed at preventing or detecting material errors in the classification and presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements, as well as in the corresponding disclosures and the recording of all\nsubcontracting expenses over the correct period. We took steps to address these material weaknesses and\nimplemented remediation plans. For a discussion about these remediation measures, see \"Item 15.\nControls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report.\nThe Company's management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control at the\nend of the year ended December 31, 2023. Management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for\nexternal purposes. See \"Item 15. Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report.\nThe Company cannot give any assurance that it will be able to maintain the appropriate level of control to\nprevent future material weaknesses.\nIn addition, once it loses EGC status, the Company will have to comply with Section 404(b) of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. The rules governing the standards that must be met for the Company's management\nto assess our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nare complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. These stringent\nstandards require that the Company's audit committee be advised and regularly updated on management’s\nreview of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this obligation, the Company must\nmaintain an extensive framework of internal control over financial reporting, that needs to be regularly\nupdated and tested. This process is time-consuming, costly, and complicated. The Company's independent\nregistered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls\nover financial reporting beginning with our annual report following the date on which we are no longer an\n“emerging growth company.” The management of the Company may not be able to effectively and timely\nimplement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and\nreporting requirements that are now applicable to the Company as a public company listed in the United\nStates.\nIf the Company does not succeed in maintaining the appropriate level of internal control, it could result in\nmaterial misstatements in its financial statements, result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability\n47\nof its financial statements and subject it to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, which in turn could harm the\nmarket value of its ordinary shares and ADSs.\nInnate's internal computerized systems, or those of its third-party contractors or consultants, may fail\nor suffer security breaches and be subject to malicious intent or cyberattack, which could result in a\nmaterial disruption of its product development programs and in its operations in general.\nThe Company has implemented a security policy that is intended to secure its data against impermissible\naccess and to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of the data. To monitor these aspects, the\nCompany set up a dedicated governance structure. See \"Item 16K.—Cybersecurity.\" Despite the\nimplementation of such processes and measures, Innate's internal computer systems and those of its third-\nparty contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access,\nnatural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures and other sources. Moreover,\npart of the Company's information system is “cloud”-based and thus is not fully under its control.\nIn addition, Innate's research and development facility and headquarters in Luminy, France, is located in\nan area that may be more susceptible to wildfires. If Innate's facility or computer systems are damaged by\nfire despite the fire prevention and data archiving measures it has put in place, it could suffer financial\nlosses and delays in its operations.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in Innate's operations, it could result in a material\ndisruption of its programs and more generally of its operations. For example, the loss of clinical study\ndata for Innate's product candidates could result in delays in its regulatory approval efforts and\nsignificantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the lost data. To the extent that any disruption or\nsecurity breach results in a loss of or damage to Innate's data or applications or other data or applications\nrelating to its technology or product candidates or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, it could incur liabilities, including penalties under data privacy laws such as the GDPR and\nother regulations, and the further development of its product candidates could be delayed. Even if the\nCompany has not experienced any cyber breach to date, should any of these risks materialize, this could\nhave a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Company has subscribed to insurance covering \"cyber\" and fraud. This insurance may be insufficient\nwith regard to the level of financial, legal, operational and reputational impacts that could arise from a\ndisruption or a break of the Company information systems.\nThe Company may encounter difficulties in managing the Company development and support changes\nin its strategy, which could disrupt its operations.\nThe opportunities taken, the decisions made, the successes and failures of Innate's research and\ndevelopment programs and its operations in general can have significant impacts on its workforce and the\nscope of its operations.\nThe strong growth in the Company's headcount over the last five years as well as the recent\ntransformations of the Company, in particular in connection with the acquisition in 2018 of Lumoxiti,\nInnate's first commercial product, have been accompanied by structural changes within the organization\nand its operating modes. Such rapid changes may lead to a deterioration in working conditions and the\nleave of employees, which could lead to a loss of knowledge and expertise, a decrease in the performance\nof Innate's operations and therefore a reduced level of achievement of its objectives.\nMoreover, in December 2020, the decision of returning Lumoxiti commercial rights to AstraZeneca was\nfollowed by an immediate reduction of Innate's commercial operations and headcounts in the United\nStates. Although the Company gained some experience in the late stage development and marketing and\ncommercialization of pharmaceutical products, such experience was short and may not have resulted in a\n48\nsufficient acquisition of skills to anticipate and tackle the marketing and commercialization of Innate's\nother drug candidates.\nIn addition, in order to support the development of the Company and changes in strategy, the Company\nmust continue to implement and improve its management and operational and financial systems, adapt its\nfacilities and recruit and train qualified personnel. Due to Innate's limited financial resources, it may not\nbe able to effectively manage the development of Innate's business, which could result in weaknesses in\nits infrastructure, operational errors, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced\nproductivity of remaining employees. The Company may also experience difficulties in recruiting,\ntraining and retaining additional qualified personnel, particularly in key positions. Added to this is the fact\nthat the Company is located in Marseille and is competing with other locations that potential recruits may\nfind more attractive.\n[If the Company were to acquire assets or companies, the success of such an acquisition would depend on\nits capacity to carry out such acquisitions and to integrate such assets or companies into its existing\noperations. The implementation of such a strategy could impose significant constraints, including:\n• human resources: recruiting, integrating, training, managing, motivating and retaining a\ngrowing number of employees;\n• financial and management system resources: identification and management of appropriate\nfinancing and management of its financial reporting systems; and\n• infrastructure: expansion or transfer of its laboratories or the development of its information\ntechnology system.\nIf the Company is unable to manage such changes or has difficulty integrating any acquisitions, it could\nhave a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.]\nThe Company relies on certain independent organizations, partners, advisors and consultants to\nprovide certain services and needs to hire new employees and expand its use of service providers.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 179 employees. As Innate's development plans and strategies\ndevelop, Innate Pharma may need additional managerial, operational, marketing, financial and other\npersonnel.\nThe Company currently relies, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in part on certain\nindependent organizations, partners, advisors and consultants to provide certain services. There can be no\nassurance that the services of these independent organizations, partners, advisors and consultants will\ncontinue to be available to Innate on a timely basis when needed, or that Innate can find qualified\nreplacements. In addition, if Innate Pharma is unable to effectively manage its outsourced activities or if\nthe quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, its clinical\ntrials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and it may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of its\nproduct candidates or otherwise advance its business. There can be no assurance that Innate will be able\nto manage its existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on\neconomically reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf the Company is not able to effectively expand its organization by hiring new employees and expanding\nits groups of consultants and contractors, it may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary\nto further develop and commercialize its product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve its\nresearch, development and commercialization goals.\n49\nThe Company depends on qualified management personnel, and its business could be harmed if Innate\nloses key personnel and cannot attract new personnel.\nInnate's ability to retain key persons in its organization and to recruit qualified personnel is crucial for its\nsuccess. In particular, its success depends heavily on its ability to retain key people in its organization,\nincluding key scientific and medical personnel.\nShould the Company be unable to retain the individuals who form its team of key managers and key\nscientific advisors, it could have a material adverse effect on its business and development and could\nconsequently affect its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nInnate Pharma will need to recruit qualified scientific and medical personnel to carry out its clinical\nstudies and expand into new areas that require specialized skills, such as regulatory matters, marketing\nand manufacturing. Innate competes with other companies, research organizations and academic\ninstitutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel.\nCompetition for such personnel is very intense in the biopharmaceutical field, and there can be no\nassurance that the Company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel, and the failure to\ndo so could harm its operations and its growth prospects. Should any of these risks materialize, this could\nhave a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nInnate's Research and Development facility and Headquarters in Luminy, France, are exposed to\nforest fires.\nThe Company's Research and Development facility and Headquarters in Luminy, France, are exposed to\nforest fires. Luminy is an area on the outskirts of Marseille, composed in part of undeveloped hills\ncovered with shrubs and pine trees. It is also located next to a natural park entirely covered by the same\ntype of Mediterranean vegetation. Summers are hot and dry, and this type of vegetation is prone to forest\nfires. Indeed, in September 2016, such a forest fire came relatively close to inhabited areas, including the\nCompany's facilities, where employees had to remain confined for several hours.\nIn order to prevent the risk of fire, fire prevention measures are implemented, such as pruning shrubs in\nthe surrounding green areas and implementing a maintenance plan for fire-fighting equipment. In\naddition, computer data backup and archiving measures are implemented, allowing the regularly backed-\nup data to be stored on the premises of a specialized service provider. In addition, rare biological material\nused by the Company has been identified, duplicated and stored at other sites, at the premises of\nspecialized service providers.\nHowever, these measures do not guarantee that another forest fire would not damage the Company's\npremises in Luminy, which would result in financial losses, development delays of various durations or\neven the suspension of the Company's activities.\nThe Company may use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in its business, and any claims\nrelating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and\ncostly.\nInnate's research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including\nchemicals, biological and radioactive materials. The Company cannot eliminate the risk of accidental\ncontamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Innate also handles genetically\nrecombined material, genetically modified species and pathological biological samples. Consequently, in\nFrance and in the jurisdictions where the Company conducts clinical trials, it is subject to environment\nand safety laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of hazardous\nmaterials, including chemical and biological products and radioactive materials. The Company imposes\npreventive and protective measures for the protection of its workforce and waste control management in\n50\naccordance with applicable laws, including part four of the French Labor Code, relating to occupational\nhealth and safety.\nIn France, the Company is required to comply with a number of national, regional and local legislative or\nregulatory provisions regarding radiation and hazardous materials, including specific regulations\nregarding the use, handling and storage of radioactive materials and the potential exposure of employees\nto hazardous materials and radiation. Innate must also comply with French regulations concerning the use\nand handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in confined spaces.\nIf Innate fails to comply with applicable regulations, it could be subject to fines and may have to suspend\nall or part of its operations. Compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations involves\nadditional costs, and Innate Pharma may have to incur significant costs to comply with future laws and\nregulations in relevant jurisdictions. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could require\nInnate to purchase equipment, modify facilities and undertake considerable expenses. The Company\ncould be liable for any inadvertent contamination, injury or damage, which could negatively affect its\nbusiness, although the Company has subscribed to an insurance policy covering certain risks inherent to\nits business.\nProduct liability and other lawsuits could divert Innate's resources, result in substantial liabilities,\nreduce the commercial potential of its product candidates and damage its reputation.\nGiven that the Company develops therapeutic products intended to be tested on humans and used to treat\nhumans, the risk that Innate Pharma may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in its business.\nSide effects of, or manufacturing defects in, products that the Company develops could result in the\ndeterioration of a patient’s condition, injury or even death. For example, its liability could be sought by\npatients participating in the clinical trials in the context of the development of the therapeutic products\ntested and unexpected side effects resulting from the administration of these products. Once a product is\napproved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Criminal or\ncivil proceedings might be filed against Innate by patients, regulatory authorities, biopharmaceutical\ncompanies and any other third party using or marketing Innate's products. These actions could include\nclaims resulting from acts by Innate's partners, licensees and subcontractors, over which the Company has\nlittle or no control. These lawsuits may divert Innate's management from pursuing its business strategy\nand may be costly to defend. In addition, if the Company is held liable in any of these lawsuits, it may\nincur substantial liabilities, may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of the affected\nproducts and may suffer damage to its reputation.\nAlthough the clinical study process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always\npossible that a drug, even after regulatory approval, may exhibit unforeseen side effects. If any of Innate's\nproduct candidates were to cause adverse side effects during clinical studies or after approval of the\nproduct candidate, the Company may be exposed to substantial liabilities. Physicians and patients may not\ncomply with any warnings that identify known potential adverse effects and patients who should not use\nInnate's product candidates.\nThe Company has obtained liability insurance coverage for each of its clinical studies in compliance with\nlocal legislation and rules. In the United States, Innate's aggregate insurance coverage for its ongoing\nclinical studies is limited to €10.0 million per year and in the aggregate. Innate's insurance coverage may\nnot be sufficient to cover any expenses or losses the Company may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage\nis becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, Innate Pharma may not be able to maintain\ninsurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect itself against losses due to\nliability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had\nunanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if\nresolved in Innate's favor, could be substantial. A successful product liability claim, or series of claims,\n51\nbrought against Innate could cause Innate's share price to decline and, if judgments exceed its insurance\ncoverage, could decrease its cash and adversely affect its business.\nTo date, the Company is covered by a product liability insurance with a coverage amount of €10 million\nper year in the aggregate. If Innate is the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the\nlimits of any insurance coverage Innate Pharma obtains, the Company would incur substantial charges\nthat would adversely affect its earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might\notherwise be available for the development and commercial launch of its product programs. Should any of\nthese risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nInnate Pharma's employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including violating\napplicable regulatory standards and requirements, engaging in insider trading or violating the terms of\ntheir confidentiality agreements, which could significantly harm Innate's business.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees\ncould include intentional failure to comply with legal requirements or the requirements of national\nauthorities, the EMA, FDA and other government regulators; failure to provide accurate information to\napplicable government authorities; failure to comply with fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and\nregulations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere; and failure to report financial information or data\naccurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business\narrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent\nfraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict\nor prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer\nincentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the\nimproper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could\nresult in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to Innate's reputation. Innate Pharma has a Code of Ethics\nthat applies to all employees and consultants, and other policies and charters, but it is not always possible\nto identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions it takes to detect and prevent this activity\nmay be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting Innate from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these\nlaws or regulations.\nIn order to protect its proprietary technology and processes, the Company relies in part on confidentiality\nagreements with its partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored\nresearchers, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential\ninformation and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of\nconfidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and\ndetermine the scope of Innate's proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection\ncould adversely affect its competitive business position. Should any of these risks materialize, this could\nhave a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Company may acquire businesses or products in the future, and Innate may not realize the\nbenefits of such acquisitions.\nAlthough Innate's current strategy involves continuing to grow its business internally, the Company may\ngrow externally through selective acquisitions of complementary products and technologies, or of\ncompanies with such assets. If such acquisitions were to become necessary or attractive in the future, the\nCompany may not be able to identify appropriate targets or make acquisitions under satisfactory\nconditions, in particular, satisfactory price conditions. In addition, Innate Pharma may be unable to obtain\nthe financing for these acquisitions under favorable conditions and could be led to finance these\n52\nacquisitions using cash that could be allocated to other purposes in the context of existing operations.\nInnate may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new\nproducts resulting from an acquisition that delays or prevents Innate from realizing their expected benefits\nor enhancing its business. The Company cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, the\nCompany will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction, which could have a material\nadverse effect on Innate's business, financial conditions, earnings and prospects.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively\naffect Innate's business and results of operations.\nClimate change presents risks to Innate's operations, including the potential for additional regulatory\nrequirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and\nwater availability challenges that may impact Innate's facilities and those of Innate's suppliers. Natural\ndisasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding,\nmay pose physical risks to Innate's facilities and disrupt the operation of Innate's supply chain.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements\ndesigned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the\nenvironment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations,\nthe Company may experience disruption in or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing,\nmanufacturing and distribution of Innate's products, which may adversely affect Innate's business, results\nof operations or financial condition.\nThe current state of the world financial market and current economic conditions could have a material\nadverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global economy is facing a number of actual and potential challenges, including the military conflict\nbetween Ukraine and Russia, the conflict in Israel and the Middle East region generally, and the banking\ncrises or failures, such as the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and other U.S. regional banks and the\ninstability of certain European banks. If the conditions in the global economy remain uncertain or\ncontinue to be volatile, or if they deteriorate, including as a result of the ongoing military conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine, the conflict in Israel, banking crises or other geopolitical events, the Company's\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, increases in inflation raise the Company's costs for labor, materials and services and other\ncosts required to grow and operate our business, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may\nadversely impact its financial condition. Increases in inflation, along with the uncertainties surrounding\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical developments, banking crises and global supply chain\ndisruptions, have caused, and may in the future cause instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets,\npotentially making it more difficult for Innate to obtain additional funds. Such risks and disruptions may\nalso negatively impact Innate's supply chain, manufacturing arrangements, preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, which could have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects. The extent and duration of the current economic conditions and resulting market disruptions\nare impossible to predict but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of\nother risks described in this Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n53\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights\nIts ability to compete may be adversely affected if the Company does not adequately obtain, maintain,\nprotect and enforce Innate's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or if the scope of intellectual\nproperty protection the Company obtains is not sufficiently broad.\nInnate's success depends, in large part, on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual\nproperty protection in the United States and other countries with respect to Innate's product candidates.\nHowever, the Company may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce Innate's patents and other\nintellectual property rights, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. For example, the\nCompany cannot guarantee:\n• that the Company will file all necessary or desirable patent applications or that the Company\nwill obtain the patents that the Company has applied for and that are under review;\n• that the Company will be able to develop new patentable product candidates or technologies or\nobtain patents to protect such new product candidates or technologies;\n• that the Company or its licensing or collaboration partners were the first to make the product\ncandidates or technologies covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that\nthe Company licenses or owns;\n• that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient rights to all necessary or desirable patents or\nother intellectual property rights, whether at all or on reasonable terms;\n• that the scope of any issued patents that the Company owns or licenses will be broad enough\nto protect its product candidates or effectively prevent others from commercializing\ncompetitive technologies and product candidates; and\n• that there is no risk of its owned and licensed patents being challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented by a third party.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and Innate may not be able to\nfile, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable\ncost or in a timely manner. For example, the Company does not intend to systematically file, maintain,\nprosecute and defend patents on its product candidates in all countries. Consequently, Innate may not be\nable to prevent third parties from exploiting products that are the same as or similar to its products and\nproduct candidates in countries in which it does not obtain patent protection, or from selling or importing\nsuch products in and into the countries in which it does have patent protection. It is also possible that the\nCompany will fail to identify patentable aspects of its research and development output in time to obtain\npatent protection. Although the Company enters into confidentiality agreements with parties who have\naccess to confidential or patentable aspects of its research and development output, such as its employees,\nconsultants, CROs, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, any of these\nparties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby\njeopardizing its ability to seek patent protection. Given the amount of time required for the development,\ntesting and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire\nbefore or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, Innate's intellectual property may\nnot provide Innate with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates\nsimilar or identical to Innate's products. In addition, in some circumstances, the Company may not have\nthe right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents\nand patent applications covering technology that the Company licenses to or from third parties. For\nexample, pursuant to its license agreement with AstraZeneca for monalizumab, AstraZeneca retains\n54\ncontrol of such activities for certain patents that the Company licenses to it under the agreement and\npatents that arise under the collaboration. Innate cannot be certain that these patents and patent\napplications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced and defended in a manner consistent\nwith the best interest of its business. If any third party that controls Innate's patents and patent\napplications fails to maintain Innate's patents or such third party loses rights to Innate's patents or patent\napplications, Innate's rights to those patents and underlying technology may be reduced or eliminated and\nthe Company's right to develop and commercialize its product candidates that are subject to such rights\ncould be adversely affected.\nMoreover, some of Innate's patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with\nthird parties. If the Company is unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners’\ninterest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other\nthird parties, including its competitors, and its competitors could market competing products and\ntechnology. Innate may also need the cooperation of any such co-owners of its patents in order to enforce\nsuch patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us.\nThe coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and\nits scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its\ninventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Even if patent applications the Company licenses or owns\ncurrently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide Innate with any\nmeaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from circumventing its patents by\ndeveloping similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner, or otherwise\nprovide Innate with any competitive advantage. Challenges from competitors or other third parties could\nreduce the scope of Innate's patents or render them invalid or unenforceable, which could limit its ability\nto stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and product candidates, or\nlimit the duration of the patent protection for Innate Pharma's product candidates. The legal proceedings\nthat the Company may then have to enter into in order to enforce and defend its intellectual property\ncould be very costly and could distract its management and other personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities, notably in the case of lawsuits in the United States. The probability of disputes arising\nover Innate's intellectual property will increase progressively as patents are granted and as the value and\nappeal of the inventions protected by these patents are confirmed. The occurrence of any of these events\nconcerning any of Innate's patents or intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on\nits business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are even higher for the\nCompany, because of its limited financial and human resources.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain,\ninvolves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years.\nAs a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of Innate's patent rights are\nhighly uncertain. The Company's pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being\nissued which protect its technology or product candidates or which effectively prevent others from\ncommercializing competitive technologies and product candidates. Furthermore, its owned and in-\nlicensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the\nresearch resulting in certain of its owned and licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by\nthe U.S. government. As a result, the government may have certain rights, or march-in rights, to such\npatent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the\ngovernment generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license\nauthorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit\nthe government to disclose Innate's confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in\nrights to use or allow third parties to use its licensed technology. The government can exercise its march-\nin rights if it determines that action is necessary because the Company failed to achieve practical\n55\napplication of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety\nneeds, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition,\nInnate's rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products\nembodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by the government of such rights could\nharm Innate Pharma's competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nThird parties may allege that the Company or its partners infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate\nsuch third parties’ intellectual property rights, which could prevent or delay its development efforts,\nstop Innate from commercializing its product candidates, or increase the costs of commercializing its\nproduct candidates.\nThe Company's commercial success depends on its ability and the ability of its partners to develop,\nmanufacture, market and sell its product candidates, and use its proprietary technologies, without\ninfringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any intellectual property or proprietary rights of third\nparties. The field of biopharmaceuticals involves significant patent and other intellectual property\nlitigation, which can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The\ninterpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering biopharmaceutical compositions\nalso may be uncertain and difficult to determine.\nInnate may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to its product\ncandidates. In general, in the United States patent applications are not published until 18 months after\nfiling or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, the Company cannot be sure that it was the first to make the\ninventions claimed in any owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that it was the first\nto file for patent protection for such inventions. If the Company was not the first to invent such inventions\nor first to file any patent or patent application for such inventions, it may be unable to make use of such\ninventions in connection with its products. Innate may need to obtain licenses from third parties (which\nmay not be available under commercially reasonable terms, or at all), delay the launch of product\ncandidates or cease the production and sale of certain product candidates or develop alternative\ntechnologies that are the subject of such patents or patent applications, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. For example, third\nparties may claim that lacutamab and other product candidates may use technology protected by their\npatents. Although the Company believes that its current activities and its planned development of\nlacutamab does not and will not infringe on such patents, which expire in the near term, third parties may\ndisagree.\nThird parties may allege that Innate or its partners infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any such\nthird party’s patents or other intellectual property rights and assert infringement claims against us,\nregardless of their merit. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are\nvalid, enforceable and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect Innate's ability to\ncommercialize any product candidates it may develop and any other product candidates or technologies\ncovered by the asserted third-party patents. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such\nU.S. patent in federal court, Innate would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a\nhigh one requiring Innate to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S.\npatent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of\nany such U.S. patent. If the Company is found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, and\nthe Company is unsuccessful in demonstrating that such rights are invalid or unenforceable, the Company\ncould be required to:\n• bear the potentially significant costs of proceedings brought against us;\n56\n• pay damages, which may include treble damages and attorney’s fees if the Company is found\nto have willfully infringed a third party’s patent rights;\n• cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product\ncandidates; and\n• acquire a license to such third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may be non-exclusive, thereby giving the\nCompany's competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us.\nEven if resolved in Innate's favor, litigation or other intellectual property proceedings may cause Innate to\nincur significant expenses and could distract its management and other personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or\nother interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to\nbe negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of Innate's ordinary shares or ADSs. The\nCompany may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or\nproceedings. Some of Innate's competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or\nproceedings more effectively than Innate can because of their greater financial resources and more mature\nand developed intellectual property portfolios. Should one or more of the foregoing risks materialize, this\ncould have a material adverse effect on Innate's reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIts patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged, and the Company may not be able to\nprotect its intellectual property.\nInnate's and its licensors’ patents and patent applications, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented by third parties. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference\nproceedings, re-examination proceedings, derivation proceedings, post-grant review or inter partes review\nin the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), challenging Innate's or its licensors’ patent\nrights. Foreign patents may be subject also to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding\nforeign patent office. For example, a third party filed an opposition in the European Patent Office (EPO)\nchallenging one of the Company's European patents with claims directed to use of anti-NKG2A\nantibodies for treating cancer in an individual having progressive disease following treatment with an\nantibody that neutralizes the inhibitory activity of PD-1. The EPO issued a decision maintaining the\nCompany's patent as granted, however the third party has appealed such decision. Third-party oppositions\nhave also been filed challenging two of the Company's in-licensed European patents directed to CD39\ntechnology. One of these oppositions has not yet resulted in a first-instance decision in the EPO, while the\nother opposition resulted in the revocation of the patents directed to CD39 technology, which revocation\nwas appealed by Innate's licensor(s). All of the aforementioned oppositions are currently pending.\nIn addition, the Company may allege that third parties infringe Innate's or its licensors’ patents, and the\ndefendant could counterclaim that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the\nUnited States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds\nfor a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements,\nincluding lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion\ncould be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant\ninformation from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome\nfollowing legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity\nquestion, for example, Innate Pharma cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which the\nCompany or its licensing partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution.\nAny such patent litigation or proceeding could result in the loss of Innate or its licensors’ patents, denial\nof Innate's or its licensors’ patent applications or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the\n57\nclaims of such patents or patent applications. Accordingly, Innate's or its licensors’ rights under any\nissued patents may not provide Innate with sufficient protection against competitive product candidates or\nprocesses; Innate could become unable to manufacture or commercialize its product candidates without\ninfringing third-party patent rights; and the duration of the patent protection of its product candidates\ncould be limited. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with\nintellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Innate's confidential information could be\ncompromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Even if the Company is successful, such\nlitigation or proceedings may be costly and may distract its management and other personnel from their\nnormal responsibilities. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nObtaining and maintaining the Company's patent protection depends on compliance with various\nprocedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent\nagencies, and its patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these\nrequirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/\nor applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO, and various government patent agencies outside of\nthe United States over the lifetime of Innate's owned and licensed patents and/or patent applications and\nany patent rights the Company may own in the future. In certain circumstances, Innate Pharma may rely\non its licensing partners to pay these fees. The USPTO and various foreign patent agencies require\ncompliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the\npatent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or\nby other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-\ncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or\ncomplete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be\nable to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material\nadverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on the Company's business.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws could increase the uncertainties and\ncosts surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents.\nFor example, from time to time, the U.S. Congress, the USPTO or similar foreign authorities may change\nthe standards of patentability, and any such changes could have a negative impact on Innate's business.\nOne example is the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into\nlaw in September 2011, and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes\nincluded a transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first-to-file” system, changes to the way issued\npatents are challenged and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination\nprocess such as allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution.\nChanges in patent laws may also modify the jurisdictions relevant to patents. For example, in Europe, the\nunitary patent (UP), or \"European patent with unitary effect\", established under Regulation 1257/2012 of\nDecember 17, 2012, provides a single supra-national patent right covering up to 25 EU Member States as\nfrom June 1, 2023.\nTrademarks\nIn addition, changes to or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries\nmay permit others to use Innate's or its partners’ discoveries or to develop and commercialize Innate's\ntechnology and product candidates without providing any compensation to Innate, or may limit the\nnumber of patents or claims it can obtain. The patent positions of companies in the biotechnology and\npharmaceutical market are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the\n58\nscope of U.S. patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent\nowners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the\nvalidity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress,\nthe federal courts, and the USPTO, as well as similar bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations\ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on\nInnate's existing patent portfolio and its ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property in the future,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf the Company does not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar non-\nU.S. legislation for extending the term of patents covering each of its product candidates, its business\nmay be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing authorization of Innate's product\ncandidates, one or more of its U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the\nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments,\nand similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term\nextension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective\npatent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term\nextension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of\nproduct approval, only one patent may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved product,\na method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, the Company may not\nreceive an extension if the Company fails to apply within applicable deadlines, fails to apply prior to\nexpiration of relevant patents, fails to exercise due diligence during the testing Phase or regulatory review\nprocess or otherwise fails to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could\nbe less than what the Company requests. If the Company is unable to obtain patent term extension or the\nterm of any such extension is less than its requests, the period during which the Company can enforce its\npatent rights for that product will be shortened, and its competitors may obtain approval to market\ncompeting products sooner. As a result, Innate's revenue from an applicable product could be reduced,\npossibly materially, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe Company will not seek to protect its intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the\nworld, and Innate may not be able to adequately enforce its intellectual property rights in all\njurisdictions where Innate Pharma seeks intellectual property protection.\nFiling, maintaining, prosecuting and defending patents on Innate's product candidates in all countries and\njurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and its intellectual property rights in\nsome countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States.\nConsequently, the Company may not be able to prevent third parties from using its product candidates or\ntechnologies in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using\nits product candidates or technologies in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors\nmay use Innate's technologies in jurisdictions where Innate Pharma does not pursue and obtain patent\nprotection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to\nterritories where the Company has patent protection, and enforcement is not as strong as that in the United\nStates. These products may compete with Innate's products, and its patents or other intellectual property\nrights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Even if the Company pursues\nand obtains issued patents in particular jurisdictions, its patent claims or other intellectual property rights\nmay not be effective or sufficient to prevent third parties from so competing.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same\nextent as the federal and state laws in the United States. Many companies have encountered significant\n59\nproblems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal\nsystems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and\nother intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biopharmaceuticals or biotechnologies.\nThis could make it difficult for Innate Pharma to stop the infringement of its patents, if obtained, or the\nmisappropriation or other violation of its other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign\ncountries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties.\nIn addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government\nagencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent\nprotection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-\nconsuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, the Company may choose not to seek patent\nprotection in certain countries, and the Company will not have the benefit of patent protection in such\ncountries.\nProceedings to enforce Innate's patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and\ndivert its efforts and attention from other aspects of its business, could put its patents at risk of being\ninvalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put its patent applications at risk of not issuing and could\nprovoke third parties to assert claims against us. The Company may not prevail in any lawsuits that the\nCompany initiates, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially\nmeaningful. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and other\ncountries may affect Innate's ability to obtain adequate protection for its technology and the enforcement\nof its intellectual property. Accordingly, Innate's efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights around\nthe world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property\nthat the Company develops or licenses. Should any of these risks materialize, this could have a material\nadverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to products, product candidates or\ntechnologies that Innate develops.\nThird parties have made, and may in the future make, claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of\nInnate's intellectual property, which may result in the imposition of additional obligations on us, such as\ndevelopment, royalty and milestone payments. Innate has written agreements with partners or other third\nparties that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from its collaborations and its other\nwork with such third parties. These agreements provide that the Company must negotiate certain\ncommercial rights with partners and other third parties with respect to joint inventions or inventions made\nby its partners or such third parties that arise from the results of the collaboration or other work with such\nthird parties. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the\nresolution of intellectual property rights that may arise under Innate's agreements. If the Company cannot\nsuccessfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from its use\nof a third party’s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual\nproperty developed with the use of a third party’s samples, the Company may be limited in its ability to\ncapitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, the Company may face claims by third\nparties that its agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign\nintellectual property to itself are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations\nof assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property the Company has\ndeveloped or will develop and interfere with its ability to capture the commercial value of such\ninventions. The Company also may be unsuccessful in executing assignment agreements with each party\nwho, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that the Company regards as its own, or such\nagreements might not be self-executing or might be breached.\nLitigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if the Company is not successful, Innate\nmay be precluded from using certain intellectual property, may lose its exclusive rights in such\n60\nintellectual property or may be required to acquire a license to such intellectual property, which may not\nbe available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material\nadverse impact on Innate's business.\nIf the Company fails to comply with its obligations under license or technology agreements with third\nparties, Innate Pharma could lose license rights that are critical to its business, and the Company may\nnot be successful in obtaining necessary intellectual property rights.\nInnate licenses intellectual property from third parties that is critical to its business through license\nagreements, including but not limited to licenses related to the manufacture, composition, use and sale of\nits product candidates, and in the future Innate may enter into additional agreements that provide it with\nlicenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. For example, Innate depends on its license\nagreement with Novo Nordisk A/S for the development and commercialization of monalizumab. Innate's\nlicense agreements impose various obligations on us, which may include development, royalty and\nmilestone payments. If the Company fails to comply with any of these obligations, its licensors may have\nthe right to terminate the agreements. If its license agreements with AstraZeneca or Novo Nordisk A/S or\nany other current or future licensors terminate, the Company would lose valuable rights and may be\nrequired to cease its development, manufacture or commercialization of its product candidates, including\nmonalizumab. In addition, its business would suffer if its licensors fail to abide by the terms of the\nagreements, if its licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties or if the licensed patents or other\nrights are found to be invalid or unenforceable. Should any of these risks materialize, this could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n• the extent to which its technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the\ncounterparty that is not subject to the license agreement;\n• Innate's diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those\ndiligence obligations;\n• the inventorship or ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or\nuse of intellectual property by its counterparties and us; and\n• the priority of invention of patented technology.\nThe agreements under which the Company currently licenses intellectual property from third parties are\ncomplex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The\nresolution of any contract dispute that may arise could narrow what Innate believes to be the scope of its\nrights to the relevant intellectual property, or modify in a manner adverse to Innate what the Company\nbelieves to be Innate's or its counterpart’s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, any\nof which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospects. If disputes over intellectual property that Innate Pharma has licensed prevent or impair its\nability to maintain its current license agreement on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to\nunsuccessfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nAdditionally, the growth of Innate's business may depend, in part, on its ability to acquire, in-license or\nuse proprietary rights held by third parties. The Company may be unable to acquire or in-license\nintellectual property rights from third parties that Innate identifies as necessary for its product candidates\non reasonable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a\ncompetitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire\nthird-party intellectual property rights that the Company may consider attractive. These established\n61\ncompanies may have a competitive advantage over Innate due to their size, capital resources and greater\nclinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive Innate to be\na competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Innate also may be unable to license or\nacquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow Innate to make an appropriate\nreturn on its investment.\nAs part of its business, the Company collaborates with non-profit and academic institutions to accelerate\nits preclinical research or development under agreements with these institutions. Typically, these\ninstitutions provide Innate with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s or its\nemployees’ rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, Innate may\nbe unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If\nthe Company is unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties,\npotentially blocking its ability to pursue its applicable development or commercialization program. If\nInnate Pharma is unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or\nmaintain the existing intellectual property rights Innate Pharma has, Innate may have to abandon the\ndevelopment and commercialization of the relevant program, and its business, financial conditions, results\nof operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThird parties may assert that Innate's employees, consultants or independent contractors have\nwrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets of their current\nor former employers.\nThe Company employs individuals who are currently, or were previously, employed at universities or\nother biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including its competitors or potential competitors.\nAlthough Innate tries to ensure that its employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the\nproprietary information or know-how of others in their work for Innate, and no such claims against it are\ncurrently pending, Innate may be subject to claims that Innate or its employees, consultants or\nindependent contractors have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other\nproprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer or other third parties.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If Innate fails in defending any such claims,\nin addition to paying monetary damages, Innate may lose valuable intellectual property rights or\npersonnel. Even if Innate is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and be a distraction to its management and other employees. Should any of these risks\nmaterialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to protect the confidentiality of its trade secrets, its business and competitive\nposition could be materially harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, because the Company operates in the highly technical field of\nbiopharmaceutical drug development, it relies in part on trade secret protection in order to protect its\nproprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. The Company seeks\nto protect its trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with its employees,\nconsultants, CROs, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. These\nagreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all\nconfidential information developed by such party or made known to such party by Innate during the\ncourse of such party’s relationship with us. However, Innate cannot guarantee that it has entered into such\nagreements with each party that may have or have had access to its trade secrets and confidential\ninformation, and these agreements may be breached, and Innate may not have adequate remedies for any\nbreach.\n62\nIn addition to contractual measures, the Company tries to protect the confidential nature of its proprietary\ninformation using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in\nthe case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access,\nprovide adequate protection for Innate's proprietary information. Innate's security measures may not\nprevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating its trade secrets and providing them to a\ncompetitor, and recourse it takes against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect\nits interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can\nbe difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside\nthe United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, trade secrets may be\nindependently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by Innate. If any of\nInnate's confidential or proprietary information, such as its trade secrets, were to be disclosed to or\nmisappropriated by a third party, or if any such information was independently developed by a third party,\nits competitive position could be materially harmed.\nInnate's trade and technical secrets include:\n• certain unpatented technical expertise that the Company believes provides itself with an\nadvantage in conducting research and development work in its field;\n• certain scientific knowledge generated by the work the Company carries out;\n• certain information relating to the product candidates the Company is currently developing;\nand\n• certain information relating to the agreements signed between the Company and third parties.\nThe unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of certain of these secrets could allow third parties to\noffer products or services to compete with its or generally have a material adverse effect on Innate's\nbusiness.\nThe structures put in place to protect Innate's trade and technical secrets do not constitute a guarantee that\none or more of its trade and technical secrets will not be disclosed or misappropriated. The agreements or\nother arrangements to protect the Company's trade secrets may fail to provide the protection sought, or\nmay be breached, or its trade secrets may be disclosed to, or developed independently by, its competitors.\nShould any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized use of Innate's trademarks may generate confusion and result in costs and delays to the\ndetriment of its marketing efforts.\nInnate's trademarks are a key component of its identity and its products. Although the key components of\nits trademarks have been registered, notably in France and the United States, other companies in the\npharmaceutical sector might use or attempt to use similar trademarks or components of the Company's\ntrademarks and thereby create confusion in the minds of third parties. Innate Pharma's registered\ntrademarks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing\non other marks. In addition, there could be potential trademark infringement claims brought by owners of\nother trademarks that incorporate variations of Innate's registered or unregistered trademarks.\nIn the event the Company develops trademarks for products that conflict with intellectual property rights\nof third parties, Innate would then have to redesign or rename its products in order to avoid encroaching\non the intellectual property rights of third parties. This could prove to be impossible or costly in terms of\ntime and financial resources and could be detrimental to Innate's marketing efforts. Should any of these\nrisks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n63\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by the Company's intellectual property rights is uncertain\nbecause intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect its business or permit\nit to maintain its competitive advantage. For example:\n• others may be able to make products that are the same as or similar to its product candidates or\nutilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that the\nCompany licenses or may own in the future;\n• the Company, or its license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the\nfirst to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that the\nCompany licenses or may own in the future;\n• the Company, or its license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the\nfirst to file patent applications covering certain of its or their inventions;\n• others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of the\nCompany's technologies without infringing its owned or licensed intellectual property rights;\n• it is possible that the Company's owned or licensed pending patent applications will not lead to\nissued patents;\n• issued patents that the Company holds rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable,\nincluding as a result of legal challenges by its competitors;\n• its competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where the\nCompany does not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities\nto develop competitive products for sale in its major commercial markets;\n• the Company may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n• the patents of others may harm the Company's business; and\n• the Company may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or\nknow-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual\nproperty.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on Innate's business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares and the ADSs\nThe trading price of Innate's equity securities may be volatile, and purchasers of its ordinary shares or\nADSs could incur substantial losses.\nIt is likely that the price of the Company's ordinary shares and ADSs will be significantly affected by\nevents such as announcements regarding scientific and clinical results concerning product candidates\ncurrently being developed by us, its collaboration partners or its main competitors, changes in market\nconditions related to its sector of activity, announcements of new contracts, technological innovations and\ncollaborations by Innate or its main competitors, developments concerning intellectual property rights, as\nwell as the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of new products by Innate or its\nmain competitors and changes in its financial results.\nEquity markets are subject to considerable price fluctuations, and often these movements do not reflect\nthe operational and financial performance of the listed companies concerned. In particular, biotechnology\n64\ncompanies’ share prices have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. As\nthe Company operates in a single industry, Innate is especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent\nthat they affect its industry. Fluctuations in the stock market as well as the macro-economic environment\ncould significantly affect the price of its ordinary shares. As a result of this volatility, investors may not\nbe able to sell their ordinary shares or ADSs at or above the price originally paid for the security. The\nmarket price for Innate Pharma's ordinary shares and ADSs may be influenced by many factors,\nincluding:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in its financial condition and operating results;\n• actual or anticipated changes in its growth rate relative to its competitors;\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n• announcements by Innate or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships,\njoint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n• adverse results of delays in Innate's or any of its competitors’ preclinical studies or clinical\ntrials;\n• adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for any of its\nproduct candidates;\n• the termination of a strategic alliance or the inability to establish additional strategic alliances;\n• failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or\nthat the Company provides to the public;\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n• ordinary share and American Deposit Share (ADS) price and volume fluctuations attributable\nto inconsistent trading volume levels of its ordinary shares and ADSs;\n• price and volume fluctuations in trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Paris;\n• additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation\nmatters and its ability to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection for its\ntechnologies;\n• changes to coverage policies or reimbursement levels by commercial third-party payors and\ngovernment payors and any announcements relating to coverage policies or reimbursement\nlevels;\n• announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n• sales of its ordinary shares or ADSs by Innate, its insiders or its other shareholders; and\n• general economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for Innate's ordinary\nshares and ADSs to fluctuate substantially, regardless of its actual operating performance, which may\nlimit or prevent investors from readily selling their ordinary shares or ADSs and may otherwise\nnegatively affect the liquidity of the trading market for the ordinary shares and ADSs.\n65\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research\nabout Innate's business, the price of the ordinary shares or ADSs and their trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for the ADSs and ordinary shares depends in part on the research and reports that\nsecurities or industry analysts publish about Innate or its business. As a public company in France since\n2006, the Company's equity securities are currently subject to coverage by a number of analysts. If fewer\nsecurities or industry analysts cover its company, the trading price for the ADSs and ordinary shares\nwould be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers Innate downgrades Innate's\nequity securities or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about Innate's business, the price of the\nordinary shares and ADSs would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the\nCompany or fails to publish reports on Innate regularly, or downgrades Innate's securities, demand for the\nordinary shares and ADSs could decrease, which could cause the price of the ordinary shares and ADSs\nor their trading volume to decline.\nThe Company does not currently intend to pay dividends on its securities and, consequently, your\nability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of the ordinary\nshares and ADSs. In addition, French law may limit the amount of dividends the Company is able to\ndistribute.\nInnate has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its ordinary shares and does not currently intend\nto do so for the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to invest its future earnings, if any, to\nfund its growth. Therefore, the holders of Innate's ordinary shares and ADSs are not likely to receive any\ndividends for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in its ordinary shares and ADSs\ndepends upon any future appreciation in value. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of\ntheir holdings of the ordinary shares or ADSs after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only\nway to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that the ordinary shares or\nADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which Innate's shareholders have purchased\nthem.\nFurther, under French law, the determination of whether the Company has been sufficiently profitable to\npay dividends is made on the basis of its statutory financial statements prepared and presented in\naccordance with accounting standards applicable in France. Moreover, pursuant to French law, the\nCompany must allocate 5% of its unconsolidated net profit for each year to its legal reserve fund before\ndividends, should the Company propose to declare any, may be paid for that year, until the amount in the\nlegal reserve is equal to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of its issued and outstanding share capital. In\naddition, payment of dividends may subject Innate to additional taxes under French law. Therefore, Innate\nmay be more restricted in its ability to declare dividends than companies that are not incorporated in\nFrance.\nIn addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect the amount of euros that the Company is able to\ndistribute, and the amount in U.S. dollars that its shareholders receive upon the payment of cash dividends\nor other distributions the Company declares and pays in euro, if any. These factors could harm the value\nof the ADSs, and, in turn, the U.S. dollar proceeds that holders receive from the sale of the ADSs.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of Innate's ADSs or ordinary\nshares could adversely affect the market price of its ADSs and ordinary shares.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of Innate's ADSs or ordinary shares, or the perception that such sales\nwill occur, could cause a decline in the market price of its ADSs and/or ordinary shares. Sales in the\nUnited States of Innate ADSs and ordinary shares held by its directors, officers and affiliated shareholders\nor ADS holders are subject to restrictions. If these shareholders or ADS holders sell substantial amounts\nof ordinary shares or ADSs in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the\n66\nmarket price of Innate's ADSs or ordinary shares and its ability to raise capital through an issue of equity\nsecurities in the future could be adversely affected.\nThe dual listing of Innate's ordinary shares and the ADSs may adversely affect the liquidity and value\nof the ADSs.\nInnate's ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq, and its ordinary shares are admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.\nTrading of the ADSs or ordinary shares in these markets take place in different currencies (U.S. dollars on\nthe Nasdaq and euro on Euronext Paris), and at different times (resulting from different time zones,\ndifferent trading days and different public holidays in the United States and France). The trading prices of\nthe Company's ordinary shares on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any\ndecrease in the price of Innate's ordinary shares on Euronext Paris could cause a decrease in the trading\nprice of the ADSs on Nasdaq. Investors could seek to sell or buy Innate's ordinary shares to take\nadvantage of any price differences between the markets through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any\narbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in both its share prices on one exchange, and the\nordinary shares available for trading on the other exchange. In addition, holders of ADSs are not\nimmediately able to surrender their ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares for trading on the\nother market without effecting necessary procedures with the depositary. This could result in time delays\nand additional cost for holders of ADSs. The Company cannot predict the effect of this dual listing on the\nvalue of its ordinary shares and the ADSs. However, the dual listing of its ordinary shares and the ADSs\nmay reduce the liquidity of these securities in one or both markets and may adversely affect the\ndevelopment of an active trading market for the ADSs in the United States.\nThe rights of shareholders in companies subject to French corporate law differ in material respects\nfrom the rights of shareholders of corporations incorporated in the United States.\nThe Company is a French company with limited liability. Its corporate affairs are governed by its bylaws\nand by the laws governing companies incorporated in France. The rights of shareholders and the\nresponsibilities of members of Innate's Executive Board and of its Supervisory Board are in many ways\ndifferent from the rights and obligations of shareholders in companies governed by the laws of U.S.\njurisdictions. For example, in the performance of its duties, Innate's Executive Board is required by\nFrench law to consider the interests of Innate, its shareholders, its employees and other stakeholders,\nrather than solely Innate's shareholders and/or creditors. It is possible that some of these parties have\ninterests that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder or holder of ADSs. See\n“Item 16G.—Corporate Governance.”\nU.S. investors may have difficulty enforcing civil liabilities against the Company and members of the\nExecutive Board and the Supervisory Board.\nMost of the members of Innate's Executive Board and Supervisory Board and the experts named therein\nare non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of its assets and the assets of such\npersons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to serve process on such\npersons or Innate in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or\nInnate based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. Additionally, it may\nbe difficult to obtain jurisdiction over us or our non-U.S. resident members of the Executive Board and\nSupervisory Board in U.S. courts in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal\nsecurities law, or assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the United\nStates. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because foreign courts may not be\nthe most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim,\nit may determine that the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is\napplicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law\nmust be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of\n67\nprocedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides. In\nparticular, there is some doubt as to whether French courts would recognize and enforce certain civil\nliabilities against us or our Supervisory Board or our Executive Board under U.S. securities laws in\noriginal actions or judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws.\nIn addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be\nunenforceable in France. An award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would be\nconsidered punitive if the amount awarded is disproportionate to the harm suffered and the defendant’s\nbreach. French law provides that a shareholder, or a group of shareholders, may initiate a legal action to\nseek indemnification from the directors of a corporation in the corporation’s interest if it fails to bring\nsuch legal action itself. If so, any damages awarded by the court are paid to the corporation, and any legal\nfees relating to such action may be borne by the relevant shareholder or the group of shareholders. The\nenforceability of any judgment in France will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws\nand treaties in effect at the time. A final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or\nstate court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S.\nfederal securities laws, would only be recognized and enforced in France provided that a French judge\nconsiders that this judgment meets the French legal requirements concerning the recognition and the\nenforcement of foreign judgments and is capable of being immediately enforced in the United States. The\nUnited States and France do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of\njudgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.\nInnate's bylaws and French corporate law contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover\nattempt.\nProvisions contained in the Company's bylaws and French corporate law could make it more difficult for\na third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so might be beneficial to its shareholders. In addition,\nprovisions of its bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more\ndifficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions include the following:\n• under French law, the owner of 90% of the share capital or voting rights of a public company\nlisted on a regulated market in a Member State of the European Union or in a state party to the\nEEA Agreement, including from the main French stock exchange, has the right to force out\nminority shareholders following a tender offer made to all shareholders;\n• under French law, a non-resident of France, as well as any French entity controlled by non-\nresidents of France, may have to file a declaration for statistical purposes with the Bank of\nFrance (Banque de France) within 20 working days following the date of certain direct foreign\ninvestments in us, including any purchase of the Company's ADSs.

French law governs Innate's shareholder rights. The depositary, through the custodian\nor the custodian’s nominee, is the holder of the ordinary shares underlying ADSs held by purchasers of\nADSs in the U.S. offering. Purchasers of ADSs in the U.S. offering have ADS holder rights. The deposit\nagreement among us, the depositary and purchasers of ADSs in the U.S. offering, as an ADS holder, and\nall other persons directly and indirectly holding ADSs, sets out ADS holder rights, as well as the rights\nand obligations of Innate and the depositary.\nYour right as a holder of ADSs to participate in any future preferential subscription rights offering or\nto elect to receive dividends in shares may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings.\nAccording to French law, if the Company issues additional securities for cash, current shareholders will\nhave preferential subscription rights for these securities on a pro rata basis unless they waive those rights\nat an extraordinary meeting of its shareholders (by a two-thirds majority vote) or individually by each\nshareholder. However, Innate's ADS holders in the United States will not be entitled to exercise or sell\nsuch rights unless the Company registers the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the\nSecurities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, the deposit\nagreement provides that the depositary will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to\nADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act or\nexempted from registration under the Securities Act. Further, if the Company offers holders of its\nordinary shares the option to receive dividends in either cash or shares, under the deposit agreement the\ndepositary may require satisfactory assurances from Innate that extending the offer to holders of ADSs\ndoes not require registration of any securities under the Securities Act before making the option available\nto holders of ADSs. The Company is under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to\nany such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective.\nMoreover, the Company may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities\nAct. Accordingly, ADS holders may be unable to participate in the Company's rights offerings or to elect\nto receive dividends in shares and may experience dilution in their holdings. In addition, if the depositary\nis unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably\npracticable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights.\nYou may not be able to exercise your right to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs.\nHolders of ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs\nonly in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. The deposit agreement provides that,\nupon receipt of notice of any meeting of holders of Innate's ordinary shares, the depositary will fix a\nrecord date for the determination of ADS holders who shall be entitled to give instructions for the\nexercise of voting rights. Upon timely receipt of notice from us, if the Company so requests, the\ndepositary shall distribute to the holders as of the record date (i) the notice of the meeting or solicitation\nof consent or proxy sent by Innate and (ii) a statement as to the manner in which instructions may be\ngiven by the holders.\nYou may instruct the depositary of your ADSs to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs.\nOtherwise, you will not be able to exercise your right to vote, unless you withdraw the ordinary shares\nunderlying the ADSs you hold. However, you may not know about the meeting far enough in advance to\n70\nwithdraw those ordinary shares. If the Company asks for your instructions, the depositary, upon timely\nnotice from us, will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver its voting materials to you.\nThe Company cannot guarantee you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you\ncan instruct the depositary to vote your ordinary shares or to withdraw your ordinary shares so that you\ncan vote them yourself. If the depositary does not receive timely voting instructions from you, it may give\na proxy to a person designated by Innate to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. In addition,\nthe depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the\nmanner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to\nvote, and there may be nothing you can do if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as\nyou requested.\nYou may be subject to limitations on the transfer of your ADSs and the withdrawal of the underlying\nordinary shares.\nYour ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books\nat any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its\nduties. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of your ADSs generally when\nthe Company's books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if the Company or the\ndepositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, government or governmental\nbody, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason subject to your right to\ncancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares. Temporary delays in the cancellation of\nyour ADSs and withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares may arise because the depositary has closed\nits transfer books or the Company has closed its transfer books, the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked\nto permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting or the Company is paying a dividend on its ordinary shares. In\naddition, you may not be able to cancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares when\nyou owe money for fees, taxes and similar charges and when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in\norder to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of\nordinary shares or other deposited securities.\nAs a foreign private issuer, the Company is exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. securities\nlaws and is permitted to file less information with the SEC than a U.S. company.\nInnate is a foreign private issuer, as defined in the SEC’s rules and regulations and, consequently, it is not\nsubject to all of the disclosure requirements applicable to public companies organized within the United\nStates. For example, the Company is exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that regulate\ndisclosure obligations and procedural requirements related to the solicitation of proxies, consents or\nauthorizations applicable to a security registered under the Exchange Act, including the U.S. proxy rules\nunder Section 14 of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Company's Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard members are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16\nof the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of Innate's securities.\nMoreover, while the Company currently makes annual and semi-annual filings with respect to its listing\non Euronext Paris and files financial reports on an annual and semi-annual basis, it is not required to file\nperiodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. public\ncompanies and is not required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K\nunder the Exchange Act. In addition, foreign private issuers are not required to file their annual report on\nForm 20-F until four months after the end of each fiscal year. Accordingly, there is and will be less\npublicly available information concerning the Company than there would be if the Company were not a\nforeign private issuer.\nAs a foreign private issuer, the Company is permitted to adopt certain home country practices in\nrelation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate governance\n71\nlisting standards, and these practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy\nif Innate complied fully with Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.\nAs a foreign private issuer listed on Nasdaq, the Company is subject to their corporate governance listing\nstandards. However, Nasdaq rules permit foreign private issuers to follow the corporate governance\npractices of their home country. Some corporate governance practices in France may differ significantly\nfrom Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. For example, neither the corporate laws of France\nnor the Company's bylaws require a majority of its Supervisory Board members to be independent, and\nalthough the corporate governance code to which the Company currently refers (the AFEP/MEDEF code)\nrecommends that, in a widely held company like Innate, a majority of the Supervisory Board members be\nindependent (as construed under such code), this code only applies on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and\nInnate may in the future either decide not to apply this recommendation or change the corporate code to\nwhich it refers. Furthermore, Innate includes non-independent members of the Supervisory Board as\nmembers of its compensation and nomination committee, and its independent Supervisory Board\nmembers do not necessarily hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent members of the\nSupervisory Board are present. Currently, the Company intends to follow home country practice to the\nmaximum extent possible. Therefore, Innate Pharma's shareholders may be afforded less protection than\nthey otherwise would have under corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic\nissuers. For an overview of Innate's corporate governance practices, see “Item 16G.—Corporate\nGovernance.”\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act and is able to avail itself of\nreduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which can make its\nordinary shares ADSs less attractive to investors. We may lose this status from December 31, 2024 and\nwill therefore incur additional expenses.\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and it intends to take\nadvantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including not being required to comply with the\nauditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the\nrequirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval\nof any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also\nprovides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided\nin Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The\nCompany will not take advantage of the extended transition period provided under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of\nthe Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nThe Company cannot predict if investors will find the ordinary shares or ADSs less attractive because the\nCompany may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the ordinary shares or ADSs less\nattractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the ordinary shares or ADSs, and the\nprice of the ordinary shares or ADSs may be more volatile. Innate may take advantage of these\nexemptions until such time that Innate is no longer an emerging growth company. The Company would\ncease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in\nwhich Innate Pharma has more than $1.235 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date the Company qualify as\na “large accelerated filer” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the\nissuance, in any three year period, by Innate Pharma of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities held by non-affiliates; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of\nits initial public offering of the ADSs. According to this last criteria, the Company will not be an\n\"emerging growth company\" from December 31, 2024.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other\nexpenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We may cease to be an\n72\n“emerging growth company” on December 31, 2024, and will therefore no longer eligible for reduced\ndisclosure requirements and exemptions applicable to emerging growth companies. We expect that our\nloss of emerging growth company status will require additional attention from management and will\nresult in increased costs to us, which could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated\nwith investor relations activities, among others. We have also incurred and will continue to incur costs\nassociated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as\nwell as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq Capital Market, which include requirements with\nrespect to corporate governance practices of public companies.\nThe Company may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant\nadditional cost and expense.\nWhile Innate currently qualifies as a foreign private issuer, the determination of foreign private issuer\nstatus is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal\nquarter and, accordingly, the Company's next determination will be made on June 30, 2024. In the future,\nthe Company would lose its foreign private issuer status if the Company fails to meet the requirements\nnecessary to maintain its foreign private issuer status as of the relevant determination date. For example,\nif more than 50% of its securities are held by U.S. residents and more than 50% of the members of its\nExecutive Board or Supervisory Board are residents or citizens of the United States, Innate could lose its\nforeign private issuer status.\nThe regulatory and compliance costs to Innate under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may\nbe significantly more than costs Innate incurs as a foreign private issuer. If the Company is not a foreign\nprivate issuer, Innate Pharma will be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on U.S.\ndomestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive in certain respects than the\nforms available to a foreign private issuer. The Company would be required under current SEC rules to\nprepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S.\nGAAP, rather than IFRS, and to modify certain of its policies to comply with corporate governance\npractices required of U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion of Innate's financial statements to U.S.\nGAAP would involve significant time and cost. In addition, the Company may lose its ability to rely upon\nexemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on U.S. stock exchanges that are available to\nforeign private issuers such as the ones described above and exemptions from procedural requirements\nrelated to the solicitation of proxies.\nIf the Company is a passive foreign investment company, there could be adverse U.S. federal income\ntax consequences to U.S. holders.\nBased on Innate's analysis of its income, assets, activities and market capitalization for its taxable year\nended December 31, 2023, and although the matter is not free from doubt, the Company believes that it\nwas not a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for the taxable year ended December 31, 2023.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that Innate will not be a PFIC in the current year or for any future\ntaxable year. Under the Code, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which (1) 75%\nor more of its gross income consists of passive income or (2) 50% or more of the average quarterly value\nof its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For\npurposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of\ninvestment property and certain rents and royalties and passive assets generally includes cash and cash\nequivalents. In addition, for purposes of the above calculations, a non-U.S. corporation that directly or\nindirectly owns at least 25% by value of the shares of another corporation is treated as if it held its\nproportionate share of the assets and received directly its proportionate share of the income of such other\ncorporation. The status of the Company as a PFIC depends on the composition of its income (including\nwhether reimbursements of certain refundable research tax credits will constitute gross income for\npurposes of the PFIC income test) and the composition and value of its assets. The value of the\n73\nCompany’s assets may be determined in large part by reference to the market value of the ordinary shares\nor ADSs, which may fluctuate substantially. The Company’s status as a PFIC may also depend in part on\nthe amount of the amount of cash on the Company’s balance sheet, the cash proceeds from any fund-\nraising activities, and how quickly the Company utilizes such cash in its business.\nIf Innate is a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder (as defined below under “Item 10E.—\nTaxation – Material U.S. Federal Income Tax”) holds its ordinary shares or ADSs, the Company will\ncontinue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. holder in all succeeding years during which the\nU.S. holder owns the ordinary shares or ADSs, regardless of whether the Company continues to meet the\nPFIC test described above, unless the U.S. holder makes a specified election once Innate ceases to be a\nPFIC. If the Company is a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds its ordinary shares\nor ADSs, the U.S. holder may be subject to adverse tax consequences regardless of whether Innate\nPharma continues to qualify as a PFIC, including ineligibility for any preferred tax rates on capital gains\nor on actual or deemed dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional\nreporting requirements. For further discussion of the PFIC rules and the adverse U.S. income tax\nconsequences in the event the Company is classified as a PFIC, see the section of this Annual Report\ntitled “Item 10E.—Taxation– Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of Innate's ordinary shares, such holder\nmay be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nIf a U.S. holder is treated as owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, at least 10% of the value or\nvoting power of Innate's ordinary shares or ADSs, such U.S. holder may be treated as a “United States\nshareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” in its group, if any. Innate Pharma\ngroup currently includes one U.S. subsidiary and, therefore, under current law its current non-U.S.\nsubsidiary and any future newly formed or acquired non-U.S. subsidiaries will be treated as controlled\nforeign corporations, regardless of whether the Company is treated as a controlled foreign corporation. A\nUnited States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to annually report and\ninclude in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed\nincome” and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether\nInnate makes any distributions. An individual that is a U.S. shareholder with respect to a controlled\nforeign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that\nwould be allowed to a U.S. shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. Failure to comply with controlled\nforeign corporation reporting obligations may subject a U.S. shareholder to significant monetary\npenalties. The Company cannot provide any assurances that it will furnish to any U.S. shareholder\ninformation that may be necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations applicable\nunder the controlled foreign corporation rules of the Code. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the potential application of these rules to their investment in Innate's ordinary shares or ADSs.\nItem 4. Information on the Company.\nA. History and Development of the Company\nInnate's legal name and commercial name is Innate Pharma S.A. The Company was incorporated under\nthe laws of France on September 23, 1999, as a société par actions simplifiée and converted into a société\nanonyme, or S.A., on June 13, 2005. Innate's headquarters are located at 117, Avenue de Luminy, 13009\nMarseille, France. In 2008, The Company incorporated its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Innate Pharma\nInc. In 2019, Innate Pharma's incorporated its wholly owned French subsidiary, Innate Pharma France\nS.A.S. (registered under number SIREN 844 853 119). Innate Pharma France S.A.S. was dissolved\nwithout liquidation on November 30, 2020, under article 1844-5, Section 3 of the French Civil Code.\n74\nThe Company is registered at the Marseille Business and Company Registry (Registre du commerce et\ndes sociétés) under the number SIREN 424 365 336 RCS Marseille. Innate's telephone number at its\nprincipal executive offices is +33 4 30 30 30 30. Innate Pharma's wholly owned U.S. subsidiary is located\nat 2273 Research Boulevard, Suite 350, Rockville, MD 20850, United States.\nInnate's website address is www.innate-pharma.com. The reference to its website is an inactive textual\nreference only, and information contained in, or that can be accessed through, its website is not part of\nthis Annual Report. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and\ninformation statements and other information regarding registrants, such as Innate, that file electronically\nwith the SEC.\nInnate's capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 primarily related to\nacquisitions and additional considerations linked to purchased licenses, and acquisitions of laboratory\nequipment. Clinical research and development costs are not capitalized until marketing authorizations are\nobtained.\nB. Business Overview\nInnate Pharma S.A. is a global, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for\ncancer patients. Its innovative approach aims to harness the innate immune system through therapeutic\nantibodies and its ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) proprietary platform.\nInnate’s portfolio includes lead proprietary program lacutamab, developed in advanced form of cutaneous\nT cell lymphomas and peripheral T cell lymphomas; monalizumab developed with AstraZeneca in non-\nsmall cell lung cancer, as well as ANKET® multi-specific NK cell engagers to address multiple tumor\ntypes. The Company has developed, internally and through its business development strategy, a broad and\ndiversified portfolio including seven clinical product candidates and a robust preclinical pipeline. Innate\nhas entered into collaborations with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as AstraZeneca and\nSanofi. Innate Pharma believes its product candidates and clinical development approach are\ndifferentiated from current immuno-oncology therapies and have the potential to significantly improve the\nclinical outcome for patients with cancer.\nThe immune system is the body’s natural defense against invading organisms and pathogens and is\ncomprised of two arms: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Recent\nimmunotherapy developments have focused on generating a tumor antigen-specific T cell response and\nhave led to an unprecedented change in the treatment paradigm of many solid tumor cancers. Despite\nthese successes, the breadth and durability of the clinical benefit achieved has been limited to a subset of\npatients and tumor types because of limited effect against solid tumors and toxicity. The Company's\ninnovative approach to immuno-oncology aims to broaden and amplify anti-tumoral immune responses\nby leveraging both the adaptive and the innate immune systems.\nThe innate immune system is comprised of a variety of cells, including Natural Killer cells (NK cells),\nwhich are involved in anti-cancer immunosurveillance through a variety of modalities. Activation of the\ninnate immune system also helps trigger the adaptive immune system to elicit a response directed against\nspecific antigens and can provide durable immune memory. Innate's scientific expertise, strategic\ncollaborations and discovery engine to seek to harness the potential of the innate immune system.\n75\nThe Company is developing a pipeline of innovative immunotherapies that it believes have the potential\nto provide significant clinical benefits to cancer patients. The following table summarizes Innate's current\npipeline.\nIn addition to these assets, the Company has an active development pipeline with programs in the\ndiscovery and preclinical stages.\nInnate Pharma's collaborations with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as AstraZeneca and\nSanofi, allow Innate to leverage the expertise and resources of large pharmaceutical companies and\nresearch institutions with the goal of accelerating the development, registration and launch of several of\nInnate Pharma's assets while providing the Company with financing to expand the development of its\nproprietary product candidates. Over ten past years the Company has received an aggregate of $679.2\nmillion (€602.8 million) in upfront and milestone payments and equity investments from its\ncollaborations. This amount includes a total of €62.6 million received from AstraZeneca following its\ninvestment in the Company's capital in October 2018. Under Innate's existing collaboration and license\nagreements that become effective upon the exercise by its collaborators of options to license future\nproduct candidates, the Company may be eligible to receive an aggregate of approximately up to $3.6\nbillion in future contingent payments. With respect to the programs for which Innate Pharma has an\nexisting collaboration or similar agreement, future contingent payments are dependent upon Innate's\nachievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial related milestones. With respect to the\nprograms for which Innate Pharma's collaborators have been granted an option, future contingent\npayments are dependent upon Innate's collaborators exercising such options, which would result in up-\nfront option exercise fees, and upon its achievement of specific development and sales milestones in those\nparticular programs. The aggregate $3.6 billion in future contingent payments assumes that its\ncollaborators exercise all of the options the Company has granted to them and that Innate achieves all\nrelated development, clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. For more information regarding the risks\nrelated to intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property Rights.”\nThe Company's Strategy\nInnate's goal is to harness the immune system for the treatment of oncological conditions with serious\nunmet medical need. By leveraging its extensive experience in immuno-oncology research and\ndevelopment, the Company strives to continue to discover and develop a broad and diversified portfolio\n76\nof first- and best-in-class immunotherapies across various therapeutic modalities. The key elements of its\nstrategy include:\n• Drive near-term value with Innate's wholly owned product candidate, lacutamab\n◦ Execute the clinical development of its fully owned product candidate, lacutamab, for the\ntreatment of patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), namely Sézary syndrome\nand Mycosis Fungoides (MF), and patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL).\n• Advance its innovative R&D pipeline\n◦ Expand its pipeline of proprietary product candidates that target novel pathways in\nimmuno-oncology using its internal development engine.\n◦ Drive the development of its proprietary portfolio, including the next generation asset NK\ncell engagers (NKCEs) through Innate's proprietary Antibody-based NK cell Engager\nTherapeutics (ANKET®) platform and continuing to explore Antibody Drug Conjugates\n(ADC) formats.\n• Build a sustainable business\n◦ Maximize the value of its partnered product candidates under its various collaboration,\nlicense and option agreements, under which the Company has the potential to be eligible\nto receive up to an aggregate of approximately $3.6 billion in future contingent payments,\nincluding up-front option exercise fees and payments upon the achievement of specified\ndevelopment and sales milestones.\n◦ Invest in the ongoing clinical programs of monalizumab for the treatment of non-small\ncell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).\n◦ Continue to explore opportunities to accelerate the development of Innate's proprietary\npipeline programs through additional collaborations.\n◦ Combine its disciplined business development strategy with its immuno-oncology\nresearch and development capabilities to further expand its product portfolio.\n◦ Manage its resources carefully and implement the efficiency measures necessary to\noptimize its resources.\nActivating Innate Immunity: Harnessing the Power of Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer\nThe Innate Immune System: Gatekeeper of the Adaptive Immune System\nThe immune system is the body’s defense against invading organisms and pathogens and is comprised of\ntwo arms: the innate immune system and adaptive immune system.\nThe innate immune system represents the first barrier of immune defense because it reacts almost\nimmediately against threats and serves as a catalyst to mobilize other components of the immune system.\nThe innate immune system functions to identify, attack and kill pathogens or cancer cells, produce\ncytokines and activate the complement cascade and the adaptive immune system through antigen\npresentation. These functions involve a variety of cells, including NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes,\nmacrophages and neutrophils. These cells then launch adaptive immune responses while also mounting\ntheir own effector responses. Throughout the body, cells of the innate immune system play a critical role\nin the immunosurveillance and detection of the formation of cancer cells.\n77\nOnce activated, the adaptive immune system responds with large numbers of effector cells directed\nagainst specific antigens and can provide durable immune memory. An adaptive immune response is\nhighly specific to particular antigens expressed by pathogens or cancer cells, but it requires time to\ndevelop in a process known as priming. Key components of the adaptive immune system include\nantibodies, which are produced by B cells, bind to antigens and mark them for destruction by other\nimmune cells, and T cells, which recognize antigens on diseased cells and then attack and eliminate them.\nThe adaptive immune response is targeted and potent and has the potential to provide a long-lasting\nimmune memory.\nHarnessing Innate Immunity in Cancer: NK Cells as a Key Player in the Anti-Tumor Immune\nResponse\nNK cells are part of the innate immune system and represent a significant fraction of the total number of\ncytotoxic cells in the body. They are active in many hematological and solid tumors and play a key role in\nthe initiation of the T cell response.\nCheckpoints expressed on NK cells include inhibitory cell surface receptors, such as NKG2A, and\nactivating NK cell receptors, such as NKp46. NKp46 is the most specific NK cell marker identified to\ndate across organs and species. Other receptors, such as NKG2A, are more prevalent in certain subsets of\nNK cells, including NK cells infiltrating the tumor, and are also present on tumor infiltrating CD8+ T\ncells.\nNK cells are involved in the anti-cancer immunosurveillance through a variety of direct and indirect\neffects. The figure below provides an illustration of anti-cancer functions of NK cells.\n1 NK cells are able to directly and\nselectively kill cells undergoing stress\ncaused by a cancerous transformation or\npathogen infection, a process called\nnatural cytotoxicity.\n2 NK cells can also kill target cells when\nthey are coated by antibodies in a\nprocess called antibody-dependent\ncellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n3 NK cells are also potent producers of\ncytokines, which are soluble molecules\nthat recruit and activate an adaptive\nimmune response by T cells through\ndendritic or other antigen-presenting\ncells, which in turn may enable the\ngeneration of immune memory against\ntumor cells.\nBy providing the initial catalyst for the multilayered immune response, the activation of the innate\nimmune system through the targeting of NK cells could potentially result in an optimal anti-tumoral T cell\nresponse.\n78\nInnate Pharma's response to cancer: harnessing the innate immunity against cancer\nThe Company has developed a pipeline around two main innovative strategies in modern immuno-\noncology:\n• The first of these strategies is to directly target cancer cells through an antibody targeting a tumor\nantigen and causing its destruction.\n◦ Innate's most advanced proprietary program, lacutamab, is a potentially first-in-class\ntumor-targeting antibody targeting KIR3DL2, seeking to induce the killing of cells\nexpressing the tumor antigen. The Company is developing lacutamab for the treatment of\nvarious forms of T cell lymphoma (TCL), such as CTCL, including its aggressive\nsubtype, Sézary syndrome, and PTCL.\n◦ The Company has also developed a proprietary technological platform, named ANKET®\n(for Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics), which develops multi-specific\nantibody formats that leverage an activating receptor, NKp46. Its multi-specific\nantibodies co-engage NKp46, with or without CD16, a tumor antigen and depending on\nthe need, a variant of the interleukin-2 (IL-2v) molecule. This approach has the potential\nto more effectively mobilize NK cells than anti-tumor cytotoxic antibodies because, in\nthe TME of many solid tumors, CD16, the receptor mediating the killing of tumor cells\nby IgG1 antibodies can be downregulated on NK cells whereas NKp46 expression is\nfrequently expressed on tumor-infiltrating NK cells.\n◦ The Company is using its leading antibody engineering capabilities to generate classic\nantibody formats as well as new products by exploring antibody drug conjugate (ADC)\nformats.\n• Another strategy, known as immuno-oncology, consists in unleashing the immune system against\ncancer. Innate Pharma has developed two approaches:\n◦ Checkpoint inhibitors: the development of antibodies that target immune checkpoints has\nbeen one of the greatest advances in cancer treatment over the past 10 years. Notably, the\ncurrent approved checkpoint inhibitors target the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways on\nT cells. These treatments have shown an ability to activate T cells, shrink tumors and\nimprove patient survival in a broad range of tumors. The Company is developing broad\nspectrum checkpoint inhibitors targeting inhibitory checkpoints expressed on several cell\ntypes in order to potentially increase the breadth and quality of anti-tumor response.\nInnate's most advanced checkpoint inhibitor product candidate, monalizumab, is\npotentially a first-in-class, dual checkpoint inhibitor designed to activate both tumor-\ninfiltrating NK cells and CD8+ T cells, likely resulting in increased effector functions and\ngreater killing of the tumor by the immune system. The Company has partnered with\nAstraZeneca to develop this product, which is currently being tested in a Phase 3 clinical\ntrial in unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a Phase 2 clinical\ntrial in resectable, early-stage NSCLC.\n◦ Tumor’s microenvironment (TME): the TME can inhibit both innate and adaptive\nimmune responses either by producing or degrading key metabolites or by recruiting\nsuppressive cells, or both. For example, adenosine is one of the components of the TME\nthat most broadly affects immune response. It is produced by the sequential degradation\nof extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the following two enzymes: first CD39,\nwhich degrades the ATP into adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and then second, CD73,\nwhich impairs the AMP into adenosine. For this reason, this pathway has attracted\n79\nsignificant development efforts that have been focused primarily on the downstream part\nof the adenosine degradation cascade, CD73 and the adenosine receptors. The Company\nis developing IPH5301, a potentially best-in-class anti-CD73 antibody, and has also\nfocused on the upstream part of the cascade through IPH5201, an anti-CD39 antibody, in\norder to block the production of immunosuppressive adenosine and increase the pool of\nimmuno-stimulatory extracellular ATP. The Company believes this approach is also\npotentially mechanistically synergistic with many therapies such as checkpoint inhibitor,\ntumor-targeting product, etc., as shown by the results of the COAST randomized Phase 2\nstudy, where AstraZeneca's anti-CD73 oleclumab in combination with durvalumab\nimproved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to\ndurvalumab alone in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC). Similarly, results from NeoCoast randomized Phase 2 study showed that one\ncycle of neoadjuvant oleclumab in combination with durvalumab improved major\npathological response (MPR) and pathological complete response (pCR) rates versus\ndurvalumab alone, in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC patients.\nInnate Pharma's Product Pipeline\nLacutamab (IPH4102), a Tumor Targeting Anti-KIR3DL2 Antibody\na. Mechanism & Rationale\nThe Company is developing its wholly owned product candidate lacutamab for the treatment of certain\nsubtypes of T cell lymphoma (TCLs), including cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and peripheral T cell\nlymphoma (PTCL). Lacutamab is designed to bind to the KIR3DL2 receptor and to kill cancer cells by\nantibody dependant cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody dependant cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), as\nillustrated in the following figure.\nKIR3DL2 is a receptor of the killer immunoglobulin like receptor (KIR) family. In its preclinical studies,\nthe Company has observed that KIR3DL2 is not expressed on healthy tissues, except on a subset of NK\ncells (36%) and T cells (12% of CD8+ and 4% of CD4+) (IPH internal data). In addition, KIR3DL2 is\nexpressed in T cell lymphoma: 65% of CTCL patients express KIR3DL2 with approximately 50% of\n80\npatients with MF, the most common type of CTCL expressing KIR3DL2 (Battistella, 2017). This\nfrequency increases for the most aggressive CTCL subtypes, including 90% of Sézary syndrome\n(Roelens, 2019). Lastly, approximately 50% of patients with PTCL also express KIR3DL2 (Cheminant,\nICML Meeting, 2019).\nb. Indication\ni. Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma\nCTCL is a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas that are characterized by the abnormal\naccumulation of malignant T cells, primarily in the skin. CTCL accounts for approximately 4% of all non-\nHodgkin’s lymphomas and has a median age at diagnosis of 55 to 60 years (Dobos, 2020; Fuji, 2020).\nThere are approximately 2,200-4,000 new CTCL cases diagnosed per year in Europe and the United\nStates combined (SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975-2017; Dobos, 2020; Zhang, 2019; Gilson, 2019).\nThe most common type of CTCL is mycosis fungoides, or MF, accounting for approximately half of all\nCTCLs (Dobos, 2020, Bradford, 2009). Sézary syndrome, characterized by the presence of lymphoma\ncells in the blood, is a CTCL subtype with a particularly poor prognosis. The following table outlines the\nmost common CTCL types, their frequency as a percentage of all cases of CTCL (Dobos, 2020), and the\nprognosis (WHO-EORTC classification 2018 : Willemze, 2019).\nFrequency\n5-year disease-specific\nCTCL Type among CTCL\nsurvival (%)\n(%) Worldwide\nMycosis fungoides 62 88\nPrimary cutaneous CD30+ lympho-proliferative disorders 16 95-99\nPrimary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell\n2 100\nlymphoproliferative disorder\nMycosis fungoides variants 6 75-100\nSézary syndrome 3 36\nPatients with advanced CTCL have a poor prognosis with few therapeutic options and no standard of\ncare. Treatment generally includes skin-directed therapies, such as topical corticosteroids, and systemic\ntreatments, such as steroid drugs and interferon, for patients with more advanced disease or for whom\nskin-directed therapies failed. There are several approved agents for the treatment of CTCL:\n• Bexarotene, approved by FDA in 1999, for use in patients with advanced stage of MF who are\nrefractory to at least one prior systemic therapy;\n• Vorinostat, approved by FDA in 2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of CTCL in\npatients with progressive, persistent, or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies;\n• Denileukin diftitox (DD) approved by the FDA in 2008 for patients with resistant and recurrent\nCTCL;\n• Romidepsin, approved by FDA in 2009 for patients with CTCL who have received at least one\nprior systemic therapy;\n• Brentuximab vedotin (marketed as Adcetris), was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment\nof patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or pcALCL, or CD30-\n81\nexpressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy. In Europe, brentuximab vedotin is\nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with R/R CD30+ CTCL who require systemic\ntherapy; and\n• Mogamulizumab (marketed as Poteligeo), was approved in 2018 by the FDA and the EMA for\nthe treatment of adult patients with R/R MF or Sézary syndrome after at least one prior systemic\ntherapy.\nIn general, treatment guidelines distinguish CTCL by clinical appearance and localization, histological\nsubtype, extent and type of extracutaneous disease, aggressiveness and response to previous treatment.\nMost patients are not suitable for stem cell transplantation due to their age and/or comorbid conditions.\nAlthough brentuximab vedotin and mogamulizumab represent recent progress in the treatment of CTCL,\nthey are still associated with the safety and efficacy limitations observed in their respective clinical trials.\nFurther, even with these options, the vast majority of these treated patients eventually relapse and the\noverall survival rate remains poor, which translates to unmet needs that lacutamab aims to address.\nIn January 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted lacutamab Fast Track Designation for\nthe treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior\nsystemic therapies. In November 2020, Innate Pharma received Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation\nfrom the EMA for lacutamab, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome\n(SS) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab has also been granted orphan\ndrug designation by the FDA and orphan designation by the EMA for the treatment of CTCL. The U.S.\nFast-Track and EU PRIME designations support the potential for lacutamab to benefit Sézary Syndrome\npatients in need of new treatment options. The ongoing Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial, initiated in May 2019,\ncontinues to evaluate lacutamab in different subtypes of TCL.\nii. Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma\nPTCL is a diverse group of aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas that develop from mature T cells and\nNK cells. PTCL arises in the lymphoid tissues outside of the bone marrow, such as in the lymph nodes,\nspleen, gastrointestinal tract and skin (Hsi, 2017). The various PTCL types, their frequency as a\npercentage of all TCL cases (Hsi, 2017), and prognosis (Vose, 2018) are shown in the following table.\nFrequency (%)\nPTCL Type 5-year overall survival (%)\nU.S\nPTCL not otherwise specified 32 32\nAngioimmunoblastic 16 32\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma, or ALCL, ALK positive 6 70\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK negative 11 49\nIrrespective of the specific regimen used (single agent chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy\nincluding Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin, usually referred to as GemOx), patients with R/R PTCL typically\nexperience a poor outcome, with a median progression-free survival and overall survival of 3.1 months\nand 5.5 months, respectively (Mak, 2013).\nMulti-agent chemotherapy is the recommended first line treatment for the majority of patients with PTCL.\nBrentuximab vedotin is approved in combination with first line chemotherapy for patients with CD30-\n82\npositive PTCL. For patients who are eligible, subsequent stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative\noption but it is limited to a minority of patients. Despite these treatments, a high proportion of patients\nneed second line therapy. Belinostat (marketed as Beleodaq), pralatrexate (marketed as Folotyn) and\nromidepsin (marketed as Istodax) have each been approved by the FDA in this setting, but efficacy is\ngenerally limited. In the respective non-randomized clinical registration trials, the response rates to\nbelinostat, pralatrexate and romidepsin were each less than 30%, and the median duration of response was\napproximately 10 months for belinostat and pralatrexate (O'Connor, 2015 ; O'Connor, 2011; Coiffier,\n2012). None of these treatments have been approved by the EMA.\nDespite these approvals, current treatment guidelines (NCCN 2021) recommend participation in a clinical\ntrial as a preferred option for patients with relapsed PTCL after first line treatment. If clinical trials are not\navailable, a chemotherapy combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) is listed as one of the\npreferred treatment combinations (ESMO Lymphoma Guidelines). Several studies have been published\non the role of GemOx in patients with relapsed lymphoma and it is one of the most widely used regimens\nfor this patient population in the United States, Europe and Asia (Mounier, 2013; Yamaguchi, 2012).\nc. Clinical Trials\nBelow is a summary of the clinical trials of lacutamab.\ni. Phase 1 Clinical Trial - CTCL\nIn November 2015, the lacutamab Phase 1 dose-escalating and cohort expansion clinical trial was\ninitiated to evaluate lacutamab for the treatment of advanced CTCL. The trial was completed in April\n2020, and enrolled 44 patients, including 35 patients with Sézary syndrome, eight patients with mycosis\nfungoides and one patient with CD4+ TCL not otherwise specified. The primary objective of the trial was\nto evaluate lacutamab safety, and to identify dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated\ndose. Data from this trial were presented at the 2018 meeting of the American Society of Hematology\n(\"ASH\"), and reported in Lancet Oncology in 2019 by Bagot et al. The Company reported clinical activity\nin the subgroup of 35 Sézary syndrome patients, including an observed overall response rate of 42.9%,\nmedian duration of response of 13.8 months, median progression-free survival of 11.7 months and\napproximately 90% of patients experienced an improved quality of life. The overall response rate\nappeared to be higher (53.6%) in the 28 patients with no histologic evidence of large cell transformation.\nClinical activity was associated with a substantial improvement in quality of life as assessed by the\nSkindex29 and Pruritus Visual Analog Scale scores. In a post hoc analysis of seven patients with Sézary\nsyndrome who were previously treated with mogamulizumab, three (43%) achieved a global overall\nresponse and three others had stable disease as best response. The remaining patient had a progressive\n83\ndisease. The median duration of response in these patients was 13.8 months and median progression-free\nsurvival was 16.8 months.\nLacutamab was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects (AEs) were peripheral edema\n(27%) and fatigue (20%), all of which were grade 1 or 2. Lymphopenia was the most frequent IPH4102-\nrelated adverse event and occurred in six (14%) patients (three (7%) grade 3). One patient developed\npossibly treatment-related fulminant hepatitis six weeks after lacutamab discontinuation and subsequently\ndied. However, the patient had evidence of human herpes virus-6B infection. Six possibly treatment-\nrelated, grade 3 or above adverse events were observed in five patients (11%) and only four patients (9%)\nstopped treatment as a result of an adverse event. One patient stopped treatment because of grade 2\nperipheral neuropathy, one patient stopped treatment because of grade 3 general malaise, one patient\nbecause of grade 3 skin pain and one patient stopped treatment because of several adverse events,\nincluding renal injury, respiratory failure, dysphagia and sepsis.\nii. Phase 2 Clinical Trial (TELLOMAK) - CTCL\n1. Study overview\nIn May 2019, the Company initiated a global, open-label, multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial, known as\nTELLOMAK. This clinical trial is being conducted at approximately 50 sites within the United States and\nEurope (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Poland and Austria). The trial aims to evaluate the\nefficacy and safety of lacutamab in patients with advanced T cell Lymphoma. 160 patients have been\nrecruited, approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior\ntreatments (Cohort 1), and approximately 100 patients with MF who have received at least two prior\nsystemic therapies (Cohorts 2, 3 and all-comers). Cohorts 2 and 3 recruited KIR3DL2 expressing and\nnon-expressing patients respectively based on an IHC assay for use on frozen tissue. The cohorts were\ndesigned using Simon 2-stage approach which pre-defined an efficacy threshold in Stage 1 before\ncontinuing to stage 2. While Cohort 2 continues to Stage 2, the pre-specified threshold for Cohort 3 was\nnot met, and was therefore closed in March 2022.\nIn March 2022, the Company announced the opening of a new mycosis fungoides (MF) all-comers cohort\nin the TELLOMAK study. The all-comers cohort was planned to recruit both KIR3DL2 expressors and\nnon-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment\noutcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a companion diagnostic.\nThe following graphic depicts the latest trial design :\nThe primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, measured using the 2011 Olsen criteria for\nCTCL. Key secondary measures include incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, the effect of skin disease\non quality of life as measured by the Skindex29 questionnaire, pruritus as measured by the Visual Analog\nScale, progression-free survival and overall survival. The results of the dedicated Sézary syndrome cohort\nmay support a future Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the FDA.\nThe study started in 2019 and completed enrollment in June 2023 (n=170 patients).\n84\nThe TELLOMAK study experienced some supply issues within 2019/2020 which lead to clinical hold,\nnow resolved and summarized below:\n• November 2019, Impletio Wirkstoffabfüllung GmbH (formerly known as Rentschler Fill Solutions\nGmbH), the subcontractor in charge of the fill-and-finish manufacturing operations of lacutamab\nunilaterally decided to withdraw the certificates of conformance of all clinical batches produced at their\nfacilities, including lacutamab. The company also filed for bankruptcy.\n• Discussions were held with US and European national regulatory authorities regarding GMP\ndeficiencies resulting in a suspension of enrollment of new patients into TELLOMAK from December\n2019.\n• In January 2020, the TELLOMAK trial in Sézary syndrome and MF in France and in the United\nKingdom, was reactivated following authorization by the respective national authorities. In June 2020, the\nFDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the TELLOMAK Phase 2 clinical trial, based on a quality\nassessment of a new GMP-certified batch successfully manufactured for the lacutamab clinical\ndevelopment program, including the TELLOMAK trial. Regulatory agencies in Spain, Germany and Italy\nalso lifted, in the third quarter of 2020, their partial clinical holds on the TELLOMAK trial, enabling\nInnate to resume recruitment of the trial in these countries.\nImportantly, there were no safety issues related to the trial medication. This is consistent with the review\nconducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which concluded there were no\nsafety issues related to lacutamab, and the product appeared to be well-tolerated among current patients\nenrolled in the trial. Lacutamab fill and finish manufacturing operations were transferred to alternative\nCMOs\nIn October 2023, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the lacutamab IND leading to a pause in new\npatient enrollment to the Company’s lacutamab trials IPH4102-201 (Phase 2 TELLOMAK) and 102\n(Phase 1b PTCL). The partial clinical hold followed one fatal case of hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis, a rare hematologic disorder. In January 2024, Innate announced that the US Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold. The FDA decision to lift the partial\nclinical hold is based on the FDA review of the fatal case which Innate, together with a steering\ncommittee of independent experts, determined to be related to aggressive disease progression and\nlacutamab unrelated.\nBased on the results of a planned futility interim analysis, however, and in consultation with FDA, the\nPhase 1b study will not enroll additional patients. Despite objective responses observed, the Company-\nsponsored Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating lacutamab as monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-\nexpressing refractory/relapsing PTCL will not be reopened to recruitment as the prespecified threshold for\nmeaningful clinical activity was not reached.\n2. Clinical results in Sézary Syndrome (SS) (Cohort 1)\n• Final results from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study in Sézary Syndrome were presented at the\nASH Meeting in December 2023.\n◦ As of May 1, 2023, the study’s data cutoff, patients in the Sézary Syndrome cohort\n(cohort 1, n=56) received a median of five prior systemic therapies, including\nmogamulizumab, and had a median follow-up of 14.4 months.\n85\n◦ The data demonstrated that lacutamab showed robust clinical activity and an overall\nfavorable safety profile. The global confirmed objective response rate, or ORR, was\n37.5% (21 out of 56), including two complete responses and 19 partial responses. ORR in\nthe skin was 46.4% (26 out of 56), including five complete responses and 21 partial\nresponses and ORR in the blood was 48.2% (27 out of 56) with 15 CR and 12 PR.\nMedian progression-free survival was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval 4.7-21.2). In\npatients who achieved a global response, the median duration of response is 12.3 months\n(95% confidence interval 5.1-NE).\nEfficacy results in Sézary Syndrome patients (n=56)\n3. Interim clinical results in mycosis fungoides (MF)\n• In February 2021, the Company announced that lacutamab demonstrated a positive early signal in\nCohort 2 testing lacutamab in KIR3DL2 expressing MF patients in the TELLOMAK trial. This\ncohort reached the pre-determined number of responses needed to advance to stage 2, allowing\nthe Company to recruit additional patients.\n• The preliminary data from cohorts 2 and 3 were presented at the ICML and EORTC congresses in\nJuly and October 2021 respectively. Of note, the preliminary data concluded:\n• In MF patients, KIR3DL2 expression ≥ 1% appears to be more associated with advanced\nstage disease and blood and lymph node involvement compared to KIR3DL2 expression\n< 1%.\n• Lacutamab showed high level of clinical response in MF patients with KIR3DL2\nexpression ≥ 1% with six global responses (four confirmed and two not confirmed at time\nof DCO but confirmed thereafter) in 17 patients with a median follow-up of 4.8 months.\nExpansion to stage 2 is underway.\n• In MF patients with KIR3DL2 expression < 1%, expansion to stage 2 would be triggered\nonly if one additional confirmed response is observed during follow-up.\n• Lacutamab shows favorable safety profile in MF, with no relevant skin toxicities\nobserved.\n86\n• Long-term follow-up is required to provide mature conclusions on duration of response\nand progression free survival.\n• In September 2022, MF Cohorts 2 and 3 Stage 1 interim data were presented at the EORTC\ncongress. As of the March 4, 2022 data cutoff:\n◦ Patients in the KIR3DL2 ≥1% subgroup (cohort 2) received a median of four prior\nsystemic therapies, and had a median follow-up of 12.2 months. Objective response rate\n(ORR) was 28.6% (95% CI 13.8-50.0) including two complete responses and four partial\nresponses. Median PFS was 12.0 months (4.6-15.4) and Median Duration of Response\nwas 10.2 months (4.6-NA).\n◦ Patients in the KIR3DL2 <1% subgroup (cohort 3) received a median of 4.5 prior\nsystemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 13.8 months. ORR was 11.1%\n(3.1-32.8) with a median PFS of 8.5 months (4.1-NA)\n◦ Within the advanced and heavily pre-treated population enrolled in TELLOMAK,\nLacutamab continues to demonstrates clinical activity with a favorable safety profile.\n◦ Lacutamab showed low immunogenicity and reached target concentration in both the\nKIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing patients.\n• In 2023, MF Cohorts 2 and 3 interim efficacy results according to updated guidelines were\npresented at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma and EORTC Cutaneous\nLymphoma Tumour Group Annual Meeting congresses in June and October 2023, respectively.\n◦ As of the March 4, 2022 data cutoff, patients in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF cohort\n(cohort 2, n=21) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies, and had a median\nfollow-up of 12.2 months. In the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort (cohort 3, n=18),\npatients received a median of 4.5 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of\n13.8 months.\n◦ Lymph Node assessment is an important component of staging and response assessment\nin CTCL (cutaneous T cell lymphomas). In a recent update to the Olsen 2011 guidelines,\nit was clarified that the pathological assessment of lymph nodes be limited to those that\nsatisfy nodal lymphoma i.e. N3 designation (Olsen 2021). Based on these criteria, results\nshowed that lacutamab produced an increased global objective response rate (ORR) of\n42.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.5-63.5) in patients with KIR3DL2 ≥ 1% MF\n(cohort 2, n=21), including 2 complete responses and 7 partial responses. Clinical Benefit\nRate remained unchanged at 85.7% [95% CI tbc]. In Cohort 3, comprising 18 patients\nwith KIR3DL2 < 1% MF, findings remain unchanged.\n• Top-line final results for MF Cohorts 2 and 3 are expected in 2024 and when available Innate\nexpects to share them at an upcoming medical conference.\niii. Clinical Trials in PTCL\n• Despite objective responses observed, the Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating\nlacutamab as monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing refractory/relapsing PTCL will\n87\nnot be reopened to recruitment as the prespecified threshold for meaningful clinical activity was\nnot reached.\n• At the ASH Annual Congress 2023, Innate presented a poster with preclinical data demonstrating\na synergistic effect between lacutamab and chemotherapy in preclinical models of PTCL,\nsupporting the rationale for combination strategy in this clinical indication.\n• The Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial, an investigator-sponsored, randomized\ntrial led by the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) to evaluate lacutamab in combination with\nchemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in\npatients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL is ongoing.\nMonalizumab, a Dual Checkpoint Inhibitor Targeting T Cells and NK Cells\na. Mechanism & Rationale\nMonalizumab (IPH2201) is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A\nreceptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells. NKG2A is an inhibitory\nreceptor for HLA-E. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and\nhematological malignancies. By expressing HLA-E, cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by\nNKG2A+ immune cells. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and\nT cells, and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies (André et al., Cell 2018).\nb. Rationale for combinations with monalizumab\nThe Company is primarily focused on investigating monalizumab in combination with durvalumab,\nwhich is an antibody directed against PD-L1. PD-L1 and HLA-E are both up-regulated on many cancer\ncells, and they have both been observed to suppress tumor immune response and contribute to tumor\nprogression. Innate Pharma's preclinical data support its hypothesis that a monalizumab and durvalumab\n88\ncombination therapy may result in a greater anti-tumor immune response than durvalumab alone by\nblocking both the PD-1/PD-L1 and the NKG2A/HLA-E inhibitory pathways.\nThe following illustration depicts the way in which monalizumab, in combination with durvalumab, is\ndesigned to result in greater anti-tumor activity.\nThe rationale for this combination is further supported by the favorable tolerability profile of\nmonalizumab that the Company observed in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials, suggesting that\nmonalizumab is generally not expected to negatively impact the safety profile of combination partner\ndrugs.\nc. Clinical Development Plan\ni. Overview\nMonalizumab has been evaluated in clinical trials in head and neck, lung and other cancer indications.\nInnate is responsible for the conduct of the IPH2201-203 study in head and neck squamous cell\ncarcinoma, while AstraZeneca is conducting all other trials (except for the External Sponsored studies).\n89\nBelow is a summary of ongoing clinical trials in NSCLC that AstraZeneca is conducting to evaluate\nmonalizumab:\nii. Clinical Development Plan in Lung Cancer\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about one-third of all cancer\ndeaths. In 2020, an estimated 2.2 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide. Eighty to\neighty-five percent are classified as NSCLC. Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one quarter of\nNSCLC incidence. In 2018, the FDA approved durvalumab for patients with unresectable stage III\nNSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and\nradiation therapy. However, there is still a need for new treatment options to further increase the potential\nfor cure in this setting. AstraZeneca conducted COAST, a randomized Phase 2 trial investigating\ndurvalumab alone or in combination with either oleclumab (anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody) or\nmonalizumab (anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibody) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable Stage\nIII NSCLC who had not progressed after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Following on the signal observed in\nthis Phase 2 study, AstraZeneca has started a randomized Phase 3 study PACIFIC-9 of monalizumab or\noleclumab plus durvalumab in unresectable, Stage III NSCLC setting for patients who have not\nprogressed after concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\nSeparately, AstraZeneca evaluated the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant durvalumab alone\nor in combination with monalizumab or oleclumab in subjects with resectable, early-stage (Stage I [>2\ncm] to IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer (NeoCOAST) and in 2022 initiated the Phase 2 trial,\nNeoCOAST-2, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, that includes an arm with durvalumab in\ncombination with chemotherapy and monalizumab.\niii. Clinical Development Plan in Head and Neck Cancer\nIn head and neck cancer, Innate and AstraZeneca evaluated monalizumab in combination with cetuximab\nin R/M SCCHN IO naïve or IO-pretreated in a Phase 1b/2 study (IPH2201-203). Based on the results and\nthe unmet need in the IO-pretreated population, AstraZeneca and Innate elected to advance this program\nto a Phase 3 study (INTERLINK-1). Dosing of the first patient in this trial triggered a $50 million\n90\nmilestone payment from AstraZeneca to Innate in October 2020. In 2022, Innate shared that a planned\nfutility interim analysis of the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 study sponsored by AstraZeneca did not meet a\npre-defined threshold for efficacy. Based on this result and the recommendation of an Independent Data\nMonitoring Committee, AstraZeneca informed Innate that the study would be discontinued. There were\nno new safety findings.\n• IPH2201-203 was an open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in combination with cetuximab and/or\ndurvalumab in patients with R/M SCCHN. This study, sponsored by Innate Pharma started in\nDecember 2015 and the last patient last visit was in March 2023. The study included :\n▪ a Phase 1b dose-escalation portion\n▪ a Phase 2 portion comprising three expansion cohorts:\n◦ Cohort 1, which enrolled 43 patients, evaluated the combination of monalizumab and\ncetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head\nand neck (R/M SCCHN) who had been previously treated with chemotherapy alone or\nchemotherapy followed by checkpoint inhibitors;\n◦ Cohort 2, which enrolled 41 patients and evaluated the combination of monalizumab and\ncetuximab in patients with R/M SCCHN who have received a maximum of two prior\nsystemic regimens in the R/M setting and with prior exposure to a PD-(L)1 inhibitor\n(who Innate refers to as IO-pretreated patients); and\n◦ Cohort 3, which enrolled 40 patients, began recruiting in April 2019 and evaluated the\ncombination of monalizumab, cetuximab and durvalumab in IO-naïve patients with R/M\nSCCHN.\n• Interlink-1 was a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab\nand cetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab designed to enroll approximately 600 patients with\nrecurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have\nbeen previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (“IO-\npretreated”). The study started on October 2, 2020 and on August 1, 2022, the company\nannounced that the study will be discontinued.\nd. Clinical Results\ni. Lung Cancer: Phase 2 COAST Study\nIn September 2021, AstraZeneca presented a late-breaker abstract on the randomized COAST Phase 2\ntrial in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the European Society\nfor Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The presentation highlighted progression-free survival (PFS)\nand overall response rate (ORR) results for durvalumab in combination with monalizumab, Innate’s lead\npartnered asset, and oleclumab, AstraZeneca’s anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. After a median follow-up\nof 11.5 months, the results of an interim analysis showed a 10-month PFS rate of 72.7% for durvalumab\nplus monalizumab, versus 39.2% with durvalumab alone in unresectable, Stage III NSCLC patients\nfollowing chemoradiation therapy. The results also showed an increase in the primary endpoint of\nconfirmed ORR for durvalumab plus monalizumab over durvalumab alone (36% vs. 18%). Data are\npublished in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2022 (figure below).\n91\nii. Lung Cancer: Phase 2 NeoCOAST Study\nIn March 2022, the Phase 2 NeoCOAST multi-drug platform study assessing the safety and efficacy of\nneoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and oleclumab, monalizumab or danvatirsen\nand adjuvant treatment in participants with resectable, early-stage non-small cell lung cancer was\naccepted for an oral presentation on April 11, 2022 at the Annual Meeting 2022 of the American\nAssociation for Cancer Research (AACR).” The study demonstrated that a single cycle of neoadjuvant\ndurvalumab combined with oleclumab, monalizumab, or danvatirsen produced numerically improved\nMPR rates (19, 30 and 31.2%, respectively) compared with durvalumab alone (11.1%). No differences in\npCR rates were observed between treatment arms.\niii. Lung Cancer: Phase 3 PACIFIC-9\nIn June 2023, AstraZeneca presented at the ASCO conference a trial-in-progress poster on the PACIFIC-9\nstudy: \"Phase 3 study of durvalumab combined with oleclumab or monalizumab in patients with\nunresectable stage III NSCLC (PACIFIC-9).\"\nPACIFIC-9 started in February 2022 and continues to enroll patients.\niv. Lung Cancer: Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2\nIn June 2023, AstraZeneca presented at the ASCO conference a trial-in-progress poster on the\nNeoCOAST-2: study: \"NeoCOAST-2: A Phase 2 study of neoadjuvant durvalumab plus novel\nimmunotherapies (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) or MEDI5752 (volrustomig) plus CT, followed by surgery\nand adjuvant durvalumab plus novel IO or volrustomig alone in patients with resectable non-small-cell\nlung cancer (NSCLC).\"\nNeoCOAST-2 started in April 2022 and continues to enroll patients.\n92\nv. Head and Neck Cancer: IPH2201-203 Study\n• Phase 2: Expansion cohort 1\nThe primary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the trial is objective response rate, which is measured as\nthe rate of patients who had a complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary\nendpoints for the Phase 2 portion of the trial include duration of response, progression-free survival and\noverall survival.\nAs of April 30, 2019, 40 patients were enrolled globally. The monalizumab and cetuximab combination\ndemonstrated an acceptable safety profile. The trial was declared positive, as the required predefined\nnumber of at least eight responses was reached with an ORR of 27.5% (36% and 17% in IO naïve and IO\npretreated patients, respectively). With a median follow-up of 17 months (mo), median OS is 8.5 mo with\na trend for improved survival in IO-pretreated patients (14.1 mo in IO-pretreated patients and 7.8 in IO\nnaïve patients, respectively) and 12 mo OS rate of 44% (60% in IO-pretreated and 32% in IO naïve\npatients, respectively).\n• Phase 2: Expansion cohort 2\nAs of August 31, 2020, 40 patients with R/M SCCHN post platinum and anti-PD-(L)1 were included in\ncohort 2 in the United States and France. Median duration of follow-up (FU) was 13.1 months (range\n7.9-15.9).\nThe monalizumab and cetuximab combination therapy demonstrates a good safety profile and promising\nactivity in R/M SCCHN post platinum and post anti-PD-(L)1 where no treatment options were currently\napproved. In this population with a high medical need, the Company observed a high response rate of\n20% and promising 6- and 12-month OS of 80% and 33% with monalizumab combined with\ncetuximab. These results were presented at the ESMO IO conference in 2020.\nBased on these results, a randomized Phase 3 trial, INTERLINK-1, was started to evaluate the\ncombination monalizumab + cetuximab versus cetuximab + placebo in R/M SCCHN post platinum and\npost anti-PD-(L)1 patients.\n• Phase 2: Expansion cohort 3\nAs of August 1, 2021, 40 patients were enrolled in the cohort 3 evaluating monalizumab, cetuximab and\ndurvalumab in first line treatment of R/M SCCHN. Median follow-up was 16.3 months (4.4-25.7);\n13 patients had a confirmed response, ORR=32.5% [95%CI: 20-48], including three complete responses.\nMedian time to response was 1.8 months [1.6-3.7]. 6/13 responders were still on treatment, with median\nduration of response not yet reached [7.1-NR]. Median PFS was 6.9 months [4.4-9.3], and 12 months OS\nwas 59% [45-77]. These results were presented at the ESMO IO conference in 2021.\nvi. Head and Neck Cancer: INTERLINK-1\nInterlink-1 was a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab and\ncetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab designed to enroll approximately 600 patients with recurrent or\nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously\ntreated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (“IO-pretreated”). On August 1, 2022,\nthe company announced that a planned futility interim analysis did not meet a pre-defined threshold for\nefficacy. Based on this result and the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee,\nAstraZeneca informed Innate that the study would be discontinued. There were no new safety findings.\nClinical data presented at the ESMO conference on October 23, 2023 showed that OS and PFS were not\n93\nimproved with monalizumab plus cetuximab versus placebo plus cetuximab; and that ORR in the placebo\nplus cetuximab arm was higher than in previous reports of participants with R/M HNSCC with\nprogression on / after platinum therapy. Exploratory biomarker analyses are ongoing to identify\nsubpopulations that may benefit from monalizumab plus cetuximab treatment.\nvii. Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial in Solid Tumors, including Colorectal Cancer (in combination\nwith durvalumab): D419NC00001\nAstraZeneca has evaluated monalizumab in combination with durvalumab in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in\n383 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consisted of three parts: dose escalation\n(Part 1), dose expansion (Part 2) and dose exploration (Part 3). In 2018, clinical data showed preliminary\nanti-tumor activity in patients with recurrent/metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-\nCRC), a population historically unresponsive to PD-1/L1 blockade. Thirty-one percent disease control\nrate at 16 weeks (DCR: % of responses and stable disease) suggested that patients may benefit from\nstabilizing effect when 88% of patients had two or more prior lines of therapy for recurrent/metastatic\ndisease. These data formed a basis for exploring the combination with standard of care therapies (SoC) in\nless heavily pretreated patients.\ne. Partnership with AstraZeneca\nOn April 24, 2015, the Company signed a co-development and commercialization agreement with\nAstraZeneca to accelerate and broaden the development of monalizumab. AstraZeneca obtained full\noncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018. The financial terms of the agreement include potential\ncash payments of up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. With the addition of the $50 million payment\ntriggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 clinical trial, Innate Pharma has received\n$450 million to date. AstraZeneca will book all sales and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen\npercentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive if it\nchooses to co-promote the licensed products in certain European countries a 50% share of the profits and\nlosses in these territories. Should Innate Pharma elect not to co-promote, its share of profits in Europe will\nbe reduced by a specified amount of percentage points not to exceed the mid-single digits. Innate will co-\nfund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation\non Innate’s financial commitment.\nIPH5201, an Anti-CD39 Antibody Targeting the Immunosuppressive Adenosine Pathway\na. Mechanism & Rationale\nCD39 is an extracellular enzyme that is expressed in the tumor microenvironment, on both tumor\ninfiltrating cells and stromal cells in several cancer types. CD39 inhibits the immune system by degrading\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP), that is then further degraded into\nadenosine by CD73. By promoting the accumulation of immune-stimulating ATP, and preventing the\nproduction of immune-suppressive adenosine, the blockade of CD39 may stimulate anti-tumor activity.\nIPH5201 is a blocking antibody targeting the CD39 immunosuppressive pathway.\n94\nTargeting the adenosine pathway has recently been reported to improve Durvalumab (anti-PD-L1)\nefficacy in early-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients, through the use of Oleclumab, an\nanti-CD73 mAb. Indeed, in the COAST randomized Phase 2 study, oleclumab in combination with\ndurvalumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to\ndurvalumab alone in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Herbst,\nJCO, 2022). Also, in the NeoCoast randomized Phase 2 study, one cycle of neoadjuvant oleclumab in\ncombination with durvalumab improved major pathological response (MPR) and pathological complete\nresponse (pCR) rates versus durvalumab alone, in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC patients (Cascone,\nAACR 2022).\nThis supports the evaluation of the combined blockade of CD39 and PD-L1, with IPH5201 and\ndurvalumab, respectively, that can hypothetically increase activity when compared to durvalumab\nmonotherapy by altering the balance of ATP and adenosine in the tumor microenvironment.\nb. Non Clinical Development\nThe rationale is supported by the analysis of anti-tumor immune responses in tumor-challenged CD39\ndeficient mice and by its non-clinical data for IPH5201 in mouse tumor models.\nCD39-deficient mice are more resistant to developing lung or liver metastatic tumors after systemic\nchallenge with syngeneic B16F10 or MC38 tumor cells (Sun, 2010). Subcutaneous (SC) syngeneic\nB16F10 tumors also grew more slowly in CD39-deficient mice, leading to improved overall survival\nversus wild-type mice, and correlated with reduced angiogenesis and improved effector function of tumor\ninfiltrating T cells in CD39-deficient mice (Jackson, 2007; Sun, 2013). Furthermore, CD39 deficiency\nenhanced the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blocking antibodies alone and in combination with oxaliplatin\nchemotherapy in tumor-bearing mice (Perrot, 2019).\nThe Company's non-clinical studies demonstrated that IPH5201 blocking CD39 mAb effectively targets\nand inhibits CD39 (soluble and membrane form) activity, reverses adenosine-mediated T cell suppression,\nand enhances ATP-dependent macrophages and DC activation (adenosine independent). IPH5201\nsynergized with a blocking mAb against CD73 to restore activation of T cells isolated from cancer\npatients in vitro (Perrot, 2019). In syngeneic tumor-bearing human CD39 knock-in mice, the Company\nobserved that a mouse version of IPH5201 enhanced the antitumor effects of PD-L1 blockade.\n95\nCD39 is expressed in both squamous and adenocarcinoma subtypes of NSCLC with expression noted\nacross disease stages (Anceriz, ESMO-IO 2022, Poster 190P, abstract 384). In a mouse tumor model\nengrafted in huCD39KI mice, moIPH5201 was able to decrease the human CD39 enzymatic activity and\nto lower the Ado level in situ. In vitro, chemotherapies induced extracellular ATP release by tumor cells\nand IPH5201 was able to accumulate the released ATP, following chemotherapy treatment. Finally, as\nshown in the figure below, in vivo, in a mouse tumor model engrafted in huCD39KI mice, moIPH5201\nimproved the anti-tumor efficacy of gemcitabine and anti-PD-L1 combination. The three graphs on the\nleft (A) show the best tumor volume change in percentage, for each treated group in comparison to the\ncontrol group. The diagram on the right outlines survival in each group.\nAltogether, the expression profile of CD39 in early-stage NSCLC and preclinical combination data\nsupport the clinical evaluation of IPH5201 in combination with Durvalumab and chemotherapies in early-\nstage NSCLC patients.\nc. Clinical development\ni. Overview and indications\nIPH5201 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical in advanced solid tumors, in monotherapy and in\ncombination with durvalumab; and is being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial, MATISSE, in\ncombination with durvalumab and chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n96\nLung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women, with an estimated 234,030 new\ncases of lung cancer in the United States in 2018, and remains the main cause of cancer-related deaths\nworldwide. Resectable, early-stage NSCLC is considered a potentially curable disease, and the standard\nof care is surgery alone or surgery with adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy\n(NCCN 2022). However, patients had five-year survival rates ranging from approximately 70% for Stage\nIA1 NSCLC to 20% for Stage IIIA NSCLC (Chansky, 2017).\nRecently, the role of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has been evaluated for the treatment of resectable,\nearly-stage NSCLC in adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and led to improved outcomes and recent\napproval (Nivolumab/Checkmate 816 and Pembrolizumab/KEYNOTE-671). Recent interim data from the\nPhase III AEGEAN study (NCT03800134) showed that perioperative durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) plus\nneoadjuvant CT significantly improved both pathological complete response (pCR) rate (17.2% in the\ndurvalumab-based regimen arm vs 4.3% in the CT arm) and Event-Free Survival (EFS) (median not\nreached in the durvalumab-based regimen arm vs 25.9 months in the CT arm) in patients with resectable,\nStage IIA–IIIB[N2] NSCLC.\nii. Phase I in advanced solid tumors\nA Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04261075), sponsored by AstraZeneca, with first patient treated in\nMarch 2020, evaluated IPH5201, an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody, in adult patients with\nadvanced solid tumors. The purpose of the study was to evaluate IPH5201 as monotherapy and in\ncombination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and with or without oleclumab (anti-CD73 monoclonal\nantibody). This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability,\nantitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity of IPH5201\nalone, or in combination with AstraZeneca’s anti-PD-L1 therapy, durvalumab, with or without its anti-\nCD73 monoclonal antibody, oleclumab.\nThe current study status is completed and results were presented at the ESMO-IO congress\n(Imbimbo, Poster 188P, abstract 472). IPH5201 was well tolerated when used alone or in combination\nwith durvalumab up to a dose of 3000 mg Q3W. The safety profile was manageable, with the most\ncommon treatment-related adverse events being infusion-related reactions and fatigue; no new safety\nsignals were identified beyond those observed with durvalumab monotherapy. No maximum tolerated\ndose (MTD) was identified. PK of IPH5201 was non-linear at ≤300 mg and linear at ≥1000 mg. The PD\n97\nprofile, including inhibition of CD39 activity in the tumors of patients treated with IPH5201, was\nconsistent with the proposed mechanism of action for IPH5201.\nAs clinical activity results, 22/57 patients (38.6%) had stable disease as their best overall response; there\nwere no partial or complete responses. In IPH5201 monotherapy subgroup, 17/38 patients (44.7%) had\nstable disease as their best overall response\niii. Phase II MATISSE study in NSCLC\nMATISSE is a Phase 2 multicenter single-arm study (NCT05742607), sponsored by Innate Pharma,\nevaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with IPH5201, an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal\nantibody, in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and chemotherapy, in treatment-naïve patients\nwith resectable early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary objectives of the study are\nto assess antitumor activity of neoadjuvant treatment based on pathological complete response (pCR) and\nsafety. Innate is responsible for conducting the study and shares study costs with AstraZeneca.\nAstraZeneca supplies clinical trial drugs.\nThe first patient was dosed in June 2023. In October 2023, Innate Pharma presented at the ESMO\nconference a trial-in-progress poster on the MATISSE study: \"A Phase II multicenter, open label, non-\nrandomized study of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with IPH5201 and durvalumab in patients with\nresectable, early-stage (II to IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer (MATISSE).\"\nd. Partnership\nIn October 2018, Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca entered into a development collaboration and option\nagreement for further co-development and co-commercialization for IPH5201. Following the dosing of\nthe first patient on March 9, 2020, in the IPH5201 Phase 1 clinical trial, AstraZeneca made a $5 million\n98\nmilestone payment to Innate under the companies’ October 2018 multi-product oncology development\ncollaboration. Innate made a €2.7 million milestone payment to Orega Biotech SAS after the dosing of the\nfirst patient in the Phase 1 pursuant to Innate’s exclusive licensing agreement (see “Item 10C.—Material\nContracts”).\nIn June 2022, the 2018 IPH5201 Option Agreement was amended. Innate received a $5 million milestone\npayment from AstraZeneca upon signature of the amendment and is responsible for conducting a Phase 2\nmulticenter, open label, non-randomized study of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with IPH5201,\ndurvalumab, and chemotherapy in patients with resectable, early-stage non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC). The \"MATISSE\" Study has started and is recruiting patients. AstraZeneca and Innate will\nshare study costs and AstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs. Innate made a €0.6 million milestone\npayment to Orega Biotech SAS pursuant to Innate’s exclusive licensing agreement.\nIPH5301, an Anti-CD73 Antibody Targeting the Immunosuppressive Adenosine Pathway\na. Mechanism & Rationale\nTargeting the pathway that metabolizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine in the tumor\nmicroenvironment is an emerging therapeutic strategy to promote antitumor immunity (Di Virgilio et al.,\n2018, Leone et al., 2018, Vijayan, 2017). Within the tumor microenvironment, extracellular ATP is\nreleased by dying cells and has an immune-stimulatory activity, promoting activation of antigen\npresenting cells, and a subsequent immune response (de Andrade Mello et al., 2017; Ghiringhelli et al.,\n2009). The extracellular enzyme CD39 hydrolyses ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine\nmonophosphate (AMP) in the extracellular space, and CD73 ectonucleotidase (NT5E, ecto-5’-\nnucleotidase) further metabolizes AMP to adenosine (Allard, 2016). Adenosine exerts\nimmunosuppressive effects on both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments (de Andrade Mello et al.,\n2017). In T cells, adenosine inhibits effector T cell activation, induces T cell anergy and expands T\nregulatory cells (Ehrentraut et al., 2012; Romio et al., 2011; Zarek et al., 2008). Finally, adenosine\ninhibits NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis (Beavis et al., 2013).\nThe benefit of targeting CD73 in oncology has been further demonstrated by results of the COAST\nrandomized Phase 2 study, where anti-CD73 oleclumab in combination with durvalumab improved\nprogression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to durvalumab alone in\npatients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Herbst, JCO, 2022), as well as\nin results from NeoCoast randomized Phase 2 study showing that one cycle of neoadjuvant oleclumab in\ncombination with durvalumab improved MPR (Major Pathological Response) and pCR (pathological\nComplete Response) rates versus durvalumab alone, in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC patients (Cascone,\nAACR 2022).\nThe Company is developing IPH5301 (anti-CD73) as a potential anticancer therapy for patients with\nadvanced or metastatic disease in selected solid tumors. IPH5301 is a monoclonal antibody that\nselectively binds to and inhibits the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble human CD73 (NT5E,\necto-5’-nucleotidase).\nIPH5301 inhibits CD73-mediated hydrolysis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. CD73\nhas been shown to be expressed by tumor cells as well as stromal cells, endothelial cells and B and T\nlymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment, and it has been shown to play a significant role in\npromoting immunosuppression through the pathway degrading AMP into adenosine. Therefore, inhibition\nof CD73-mediated hydrolysis of AMP by IPH5301 has the potential to reduce the formation of\nimmunosuppressive adenosine, thereby leading to increased antitumor immunity across multiple tumor\ntypes, as shown in the figure below.\n99\nb. Indication\nIn the tumor microenvironment, CD73 is expressed by tumor cells as well as stromal cells, endothelial\ncells and B and T lymphocytes (Allard et al., 2017). Inhibition of CD73 enzymatic activity by IPH5301\nhas the potential to reduce the formation of immunosuppressive adenosine, thereby leading to increased\nantitumor immunity across multiple tumor types.\nc. Preclinical Development\nCD73 immunohistochemistry studies have revealed that in breast, pancreas and ovarian cancers the vast\nmajority of patients expressed CD73 on either tumor or stromal cells (Wang et al; Oncotarget 2017,\nInnate Pharma Internal data). Additionally, high expression of CD73 in tumors has been associated with\npoor prognosis in a variety of cancer types: non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, TNBC, ovarian\ncancer, colorectal cancer and gastric cancer (Inoue et al. 2017; Leclerc et al. 2016; Loi et al. 2013;\nGaudreau et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2013).\nCD73-deficient mice have been shown to have an increased resistance to the growth of tumors derived\nfrom a variety of certain tumor cell lines, as well as to metastasis (Stagg 2011). These mice were also\nresistant to the induction of fibrosarcomas by the carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), as well as to\nthe continued growth of established MCA-induced tumors (Stagg 2012). Wild type mice showed\ndecreased tumor growth and metastases in some models when administered with an anti-CD73 antibody\nalone (Antonioli, 2016, Antoniolli 2017). The small anti-tumor effect of anti-CD73 antibodies in mouse\nmodels was greatly enhanced by combination with checkpoint inhibition such as PD-1 or an adenosine\nreceptor antagonist (Allard, 2013; Young, 2016).\nThe Company published preclinical data further supporting the rationale of developing IPH5301.\nIPH5301 blocked the enzymatic activity of both CD73 expressed at the cell surface and the soluble form\nof CD73. IPH5301 was able to efficiently restore T cell proliferation inhibited by AMP in vitro. In\naddition, IPH5301 has been observed to have a differentiated and superior activity compared to\nbenchmark antibodies that are currently in clinical development (Perrot, 2019).\nIn syngeneic murine tumor-bearing human CD73 knock-in mice, IPH5301 enhanced the antitumor effects\nof PD-1 blockade, as shown in the figure below. The four graphs show changes in tumor volume over\ntime depending on the type of treatment group, which included a control group (black), an IPH5301\n100\n(mouse version) group (pink), an anti-mouse PD-1 group (blue) and an PD-1 and IPH5301 combination\ngroup (green).\nThus, IPH5301 could potentially exhibit a favorable efficacy profile in patients with advanced or\nmetastatic disease in selected solid tumors, including serving as a candidate for combination treatments\nwith chemotherapy or immune therapeutic agents.\nAs further evidence for the negative role of CD73 in anti-tumor response, Loi et al., 2013, examined gene\nexpression data from 6,000 breast cancer patients and found that high CD73 expression was associated\nwith poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), as was the association between high CD73\ngene expression and pre-surgery treatment with the standard of care chemotherapy anthracycline. In mice\ninoculated with the syngeneic 4T1.2 breast tumor cell line, a combination of an anti-CD73 antibody and\ndoxorubicin (an anthracycline) led to a greater reduction in tumor volume and increase in mouse survival\nthan either treatment alone.\nIn HER2-positive breast tumors, high CD73 expression was shown to promote resistance to trastuzumab.\nIn addition, targeting CD73 was shown to enhance efficacy of treatment with anti-HER2 therapy\n(Turcotte, 2017). On the other hand, several chemotherapeutic agents including taxanes, anthracyclines\nand platinum salts were shown to increase the release of ATP (Martins and Tesniere, 2009); (Martins and\nWang, 2014).\nAll together, these preclinical results indicate that CD73 blockade with IPH5301 has also the potential to\nenhance antitumor activity observed with not only PD1 immunotherapy, but also with chemotherapy and\ntrastuzumab.\n101\nd. Ongoing Clinical Trial\nIn December 2021, an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 was initiated by the Institut Paoli-\nCalmettes. CHANCES-IPC 2021-008 (NCT05143970) is a First In Human, Phase 1, multicenter,\nEuropean study evaluating an anti-CD73, IPH5301, in advanced and/or metastatic cancer. The trial will\nbe conducted in two parts. The Part I-Dose escalation aims to identify the maximum tolerated dose\n(MTD) of IPH5301 agent in monotherapy and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future trials,\nfollowed by a safety expansion study part cohort. In the Part II-Expansion cohort, a total of 12 HER2+\ncancer patients, respectively six breast cancer patients and six gastric cancer patients, are planned to be\nenrolled into the next expansion cohort to select a recommended dose of IPH5301 to be administered in\ncombination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab for evaluation in future trials with selected advanced\nsolid tumors. In March 2022, The Institut Paoli Calmettes announced that the first patient had been dosed.\nIn December 2022, a \"Trial in Progress\" poster was presented by the Institut Paoli Calmettes at ESMO-IO\n2022 congress (Goncalvez, ESMO-IO 2022, Poster 199, abstract 290). This trial is ongoing.\nANKET® Platform\na. General Overview\nMulti-specific monoclonal antibodies, or multi-specifics, are antibody-derived formats that can\nsimultaneously bind to two or more different types of molecules. A number of studies of bispecific\nantibodies are currently underway, such as those assessing the safety and efficacy of bispecific T cell\nengagers, such as BiTEs, which engage T cells via the antigen receptor on one side of the bispecific T cell\nengager, and a tumor antigen on the other side of the BiTE. These molecules have demonstrated the\nability to reduce or slow the growth of tumors in cancer patients, but they also carry a significant toxicity\nrisk. This toxicity risk occurs by engaging all T cells, irrespective of their specificity and development\nstatus, potentially leading to an overt production of cytokines by these T cells, referred to as a cytokine\nstorm. In parallel, bispecific killer cell engagers (BiKEs) that engage CD16 receptors found on NK cells,\nand tri-specific killer cell engagers (TriKEs) that engage CD16 receptors and contain IL-15, a cytokine\nthat promotes NK cell activation and survival, have also been developed to target antigens expressed on\nsolid tumors. BiKEs and TriKEs can be effective both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical models. These\nmulti-specific molecules that engage NK cells could reduce the risks associated with toxicity, as NK cell\ncounts represent only approximately 10% of T cell counts, thereby potentially limiting the likelihood of\ninducing a cytokine storm. However, it remains unclear whether these multifunctional CD16 engager\nantibodies can activate NK cells in solid tumors since they often express low levels of CD16.\nANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing\nnext-generation, multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.\nThis versatile, fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce\nsynthetic immunity against cancer. It leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions\nagainst cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells.\nInnate's latest innovation, the tetra-specific ANKET® molecule, is the first NK cell engager technology to\nengage activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16), a tumor antigen and an interleukin-2 receptor (via an\n102\nIL-2 variant, IL-2v) via a single molecule. This innovation is built on its existing tri-specific NK cell\nengager technology, which has demonstrated potent NK cell activation, cytotoxicity and efficient control\nof tumor growth in preclinical models.\nBecause NKp46 is expressed on all NK cells and conserved on tumor infiltrating NK cells, and NK cells\nare not expected to produce a cytokine storm, ANKET® molecules may overcome the limitations of both\nADCC-inducing antibodies and T cell engagers.\nANKET® Pipeline\nSanofi's partnership\nIPH6101/SAR'579, a CD123-targeting NK Cell Engager\na. Mechanism\nIPH6101/SAR443579 is the first trifunctional anti-CD123 NK cell engager NKp46/CD16 using Innate’s\nproprietary multi-specific antibody format ANKET®. It has shown anti-tumor activity in preclinical\nmodels, including supporting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and safety data in non-human\nprimate studies, leading to its selection as a drug candidate for development. It is part of the Sanofi 2016\nresearch collaboration and licensing agreement, under which the companies collaborate on the\ndevelopment of innovative multi-specific antibody formats engaging NK cells through the activating\nreceptors NKp46 and CD16 to kill tumor cells. Several NK cell therapies have been shown to induce\nantitumor responses, without the complications frequently associated with T cell therapies, such as\ncytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity.\nb. Indication and Rationale\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, mostly affecting elderly\npatients, with a median age at diagnosis of 65-70 years. AML is a heterogeneous cancer characterized by\nthe clonal expansion of myeloid precursors in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Despite significant\nprogress in the care of AML patients in the past decade, there is still a clear unmet medical need in AML,\nas up to 50% of patients relapse after initial chemotherapy, and the prognosis for older patients remains\npoor.\nCytotoxic antibodies targeting CD123 displayed limited antileukemic activity in several clinical trials,\neven when tested in the form of Fc-engineered antibodies designed specifically to increase antibody-\ndependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). By contrast, T cell engager molecules and CAR-T cell therapies\nhave some clinical efficacy, but are also highly toxic, confirming the need for alternative targeted\napproaches for the treatment of AML. NK cell-based therapies may provide new treatment perspectives\nand a safer alternative for targeting tumor cells in this context.\n103\nc. Preclinical Development\nIn its preclinical studies, Innate and Sanofi investigated whether NKp46-based NKCE technology could\nprovide more effective antitumor activity than regular IgG antibodies for AML treatment by generating a\nNKCE molecule targeting CD123. Innate and Sanofi evaluated the ex vivo antitumor activity of this\nmolecule, comparing it with a regular IgG1 antibody derived from clone 7G3 (CD123-IgG1+) with an\nengineered Fc domain for enhanced ADCC.\nThe anti-CD123 antibody-mediated killing of primary blasts from AML patients (AML#1 to AML#4)\nwas evaluated ex vivo with NK cells from healthy donors as effectors. The anti-CD123 antibody (CD123-\nIgG1+) mediated the killing of blasts from half the patient samples (AML#1 and AML#2) but was barely\nactive against blasts from the other half of the primary samples (AML#3 and AML#4). The patient\nsamples could therefore be separated into two distinct groups: CD123-IgG1+-responders and CD123-\nIgG1+-non-responders.\nInnate and Sanofi observed that trifunctional CD123-ANKET® displayed killing activity against all\nprimary malignant AML cells, promoting significant antitumor activity in CD123-IgG1+-non-responders\nsamples from AML patients against which the regular anti-CD123 cytotoxic antibody was completely\ninactive.\nThe minimal level of pro-inflammatory cytokine release following the treatment of human peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with NKCE in vitro (data not shown) was further confirmed in vivo, in\ndedicated pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and toxicology studies performed in non-human\nprimates (NHPs).\nInnate and Sanofi evaluated the PK/PD of CD123-NKCE administered by a single one-hour i.v. infusion\nof a high (3 mg/kg) or low (3 µg/kg) doses in male cynomolgus monkeys (two animals each for the 3 mg/\nkg and 3 µg/kg doses). Treatment with CD123-NKCE promoted a sustained and complete depletion of\nCD123+ cells in the blood of all monkeys, for more than 10 days, at both the 3 mg/kg and 3 µg/kg doses,\nwith only very small amounts (< 50 pg/mL) of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 released\nwithout any associated clinical signs.\n104\nd. Ongoing Clinical Trial\nIPH6101/SAR443579 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05086315) in patients\nwith relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-\nALL) or high risk-myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).\nThe purpose of the dose escalation and dose expansion study, which is sponsored by Sanofi, is to evaluate\nthe safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of IPH6101/SAR443579,\nInnate’s lead ANKET® asset, in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies.\nInnate Pharma announced that the first patient was dosed on December 16, 2021.\n▪ In June 2023, safety and preliminary efficacy were presented during an oral presentation at the\nASCO Meeting. Preliminary data showed SAR443579 / IPH6101 was well tolerated and induced\nthree complete responses in the eight patients at 1 mg/kg as the highest dose. In addition, Innate\nPharma shared Sanofi’s news that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for SAR’579 /\nIPH6101 for the treatment of hematological malignancies.\n▪ In October 2023, a preliminary Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analysis of\nthe CD123 NK Cell Engager SAR’579/IPH6101 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, B-\nALL or HR-MDS was presented at the ESMO congress.\n▪ In December 2023, updated efficacy and safety results were shared in a poster presentation at the\nASH Annual Meeting. Abstract details included:\n• As of July 5, 2023, 43 patients (42 R/R AML and one HR-MDS) across eight dose levels\nat 10 – 6000 μg/kg/dose were included. Patients had received a median of 2.0 (1.0 – 10.0)\nprior lines of treatment with 13 patients (30.2%) reporting prior hematopoiectic stem cell\ntransplantation and 36 patients (83.7%) with prior exposure to venetoclax.\n• In dose levels with a highest dose of 1000 μg/kg QW, 5 out of 15 (33.3%) AML patients\nachieved a complete remission, or CR, (4 CRs and 1 CR with incomplete hematological\nrecovery) as of the cut-off date.\n105\n• Data from preliminary pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamic and in vitro mechanistic\nanalyses studying dose-response relations were also presented.\n• SAR443579 was well tolerated up to doses of 6000 μg/kg QW with observed clinical\nbenefit in patients with R/R AML. The results are consistent with the predicted favorable\nsafety profile.\nIPH6401/SAR’514, a BCMA-targeting NK Cell Engager\na. Mechanism\nIPH6401/SAR’514 is a trifunctional anti-BCMA NKp46xCD16 NK cell engager, using Sanofi’s\nproprietary CROSSODILE® multi-functional platform, which comprises the Cross-Over-Dual-Variable-\nDomain (CODV) format. It induces a dual targeting of the NK activating receptors, NKp46 and CD16,\nfor an optimized NK cell activation, based on Innate’s ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager\nTherapeutics) proprietary platform.\nb. Clinical trial\nA Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05839626) is evaluating SAR’514 / IPH6401 in\nrelapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis\n(RRLCA). The purpose of the dose escalation and dose expansion study is to evaluate the safety,\npharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of SAR’514 in monotherapy in patients with RRMM and\nRRLCA. The clinical trial is part of the Sanofi 2016 research collaboration and licensing agreement.\nInnate Pharma announced that the first patient was dosed in November 2023.\nIPH62, a B7-H3-targeting NK Cell Engager\nIPH62 is a multi-specific NK cell-engaging antibody targeting B7-H3, using Innate's proprietary multi-\nspecific antibody format, the ANKET® platform.\nIPH62 provides dual targeting of NK cell activating receptors, NKp46 and CD16, based on Innate's\nproprietary ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) platform for optimised NK cell\nactivation.\n106\nProprietary ANKET®\nIPH6501, a CD20-targeting tetra-specific NK Cell Engager\na. Mechanism\nThe IPH6501 program is developing a CD20-targeting tetra-specific Antibody-based NK cell Engager\nTherapeutics (ANKET®). CD20 is an antigen expressed by a number of B cell malignancies, and its\ntargeting by therapeutic antibodies has shown efficacy to treat the patients although a number of the\ntumors develop resistance and relapse. Compared to a classical IgG1-based antibody which engages Fc\nreceptors and a tumor antigen, IPH6501 co-engages on one hand NKp46 and Fc receptors, as well as\nCD122 subunit of the IL-2 receptor (but not CD25 subunit), and on the other hand CD20 as a targeted\nantigen on malignant B cells, leading to potent NK cell activation, cytotoxicity and control of tumor\ngrowth.\nIPH6501 was designed to induce NK cell mediated-cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion by co-engaging\nCD16a and NKp46. Only the binding of IPH6501 to CD20, bridging the NK cells to the target cells, was\nable to trigger the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. IPH6501 is thus a promising biologic designed to\nharness the anti-tumor functions of NK cells in CD20+ B cell malignancies.\nMoreover, the IL-2R binding element incorporated in IPH6501 is an IL-2 variant (IL-2v) designed with\npoint mutations that abolish binding to the IL-2R-α chain (CD25), with the goal of limiting toxicity and\ninteraction with Tregs. IL-2v incorporated into IPH6501 is directed towards NK cells through the binding\nwith high affinity to NKp46 and CD16a, providing its ability to interact with IL-2R preferentially on NK\ncells and to promote their activation and proliferation at pM doses.\nb. Indication and Rationale\nIPH6501 is being developed in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's\nlymphomas (NHL).\nNHL is the most prevalent hematological malignancy, accounting for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3%\nof cancer-related deaths in the United States (Howlader 2020a, Howlader 2020b). For 2021, estimates for\nthe United States include 81,560 new cases and 20,720 deaths from NHL (American Cancer Society\n2021a, American Cancer Society 2021b). In 2020, Europe had 122,979 new cases of NHL reported, and\n107\n49,684 deaths were attributable to NHL (World Health Organization (WHO) 2020). The emergence of\nrelapsed refractory (r/r) disease among B-cell malignancies with curtailed sustained responses to\ntreatment and unattained long-term survivals has created a significant unmet need (National\nComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2021a).\nCD20 is expressed by >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Several generations of CD20-\ntargeting monoclonal antibodies including rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab have been widely\nused for B-cell malignancy therapies. Despite the recent approvals of novel CD20-targeting agents, new\nalternatives and strategies are still required for patients, which are relapsing or refractory after several\nlines of treatment. High circulating NK cell numbers have been associated with better clinical responses\nto anti-CD20-targeting monoclonal antibodies, supporting the role of NK cells in efficacy of these\ntreatments.\nc. Preclinical Development\nIPH6501 preclinical activity was explored both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies established that\nIPH6501´s main modes of action were NK cell proliferation and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity\n(ADCC) against CD20-expressing cells.\n• In vitro\nNon-saturating doses of IPH6501 on NK cells and on CD20+ cells were sufficient to promote maximal\nkilling activity. Furthermore, IPH6501 promoted NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing very\nlow levels of CD20. IPH6501 also demonstrated superiority to control tumor cell growth in vitro, as\ncompared to the CD20-targeting clinical benchmark antibodies rituximab and the Fc-optimized\nobinutuzumab.\nIPH6501 alone without NK cells did not induce direct killing of CD20+ cells. Culturing human purified\nNK cells with CD20+ B-lymphoma cell lines and IPH6501 induced the specific lysis of tumoral CD20+\ncells. Alternatively, culturing human PBMCs with IPH6501 induced the specific depletion of normal\nCD20+ B lymphocytes without affecting other lymphocyte population numbers, as well as cytokine\nproduction in line with NK cell activation. Incubation of human PBMC with IPH6501 induced a\npreferential NK cell proliferation that occurred at lower doses as compared to the proliferating effect of\nIPH6501 on other CD8+ or CD4+ T lymphocytes (expressing the IL-2R).\n• In vivo\nIn vivo treatment with a mouse surrogate of IPH6501 induced peripheral NK cell proliferation and\nactivation, and demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in a xenograft mouse model using the aggressive\nhuman B-lymphoma CD20+ RAJI cell line engrafted subcutaneously. Surrogate moIPH6501 also showed\n108\na dose dependent and significant control of tumor growth in a model of CD20-expressing B16F10 cells\ninjected intravenously (IV) in immunocompetent mice, as shown in figure below.\nUpdated preclinical data were presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) congress in\nJune 2023, including experiments on non-human primates and samples from R/R B-NHL patients. In\npreclinical settings, IPH6501 was shown to induce NK cell proliferation and to trigger high NK cell\ncytoxicity against CD20+ target cells in in vitro assays, in ex vivo assays with relapse/refractory (R/R) B-\nNHL patient samples who received at least one prior treatment, as well as in in vivo studies in non-human\nprimates. A surrogate of IPH6501 mediated a potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in CD20+ tumor models\nin mice. In addition, in ex vivo assays with R/R B-NHL patient samples, IPH6501 was shown to be more\nefficient than a T cell engager targeting CD20.\n• Non-human primates\nIn non-human primates, a well-tolerated dose of IPH6501 resulted in NK cell expansion, with minimal\nincrease in systemic cytokine levels, and to the depletion of CD20+ B cells in circulation and lymphoid\ntissues.\n• Analysis from samples from R/R B-NHL patients\nFlow cytometric analysis of samples from R/R B-NHL patients revealed that NK cell numbers in blood\nwere within normal range values, and NKp46 expression was maintained in blood and tumor-involved\nlymph nodes. Of note, in contrast to NKp46, cell surface expression of CD16 was down-regulated on NK\ncells in B-NHL patient’s lymph nodes, suggesting a potential therapeutic advantage of targeting NKp46\nwith IPH6501 in B-NHL compared with classical monoclonal antibodies. IPH6501 stimulated NK cell\n109\nproliferation andCD20+ cell depletion ex vivo in PBMC samples from R/R B-NHL patients, which\ncompared favourably with acontrol CD3xCD20 T cell engager.\nIPH6501 is a first-in-class CD20-targeting tetra-specific NK cell engager designed to promote NK cell\nproliferation and specific cytotoxicity against CD20+ cells. IPH6501 is thus a promising biologic designed\nto harness the anti-tumor functions of NK cells in CD20+ B cell malignancies.\nd. Clinical Trial\nAn international, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety profile,\ntolerability of IPH6501, and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for patients with B-Cell\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Company received a Study May Proceed Letter from FDA in July 2023.\nOn March 6, 2024, the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in its Phase 1/2 multicenter\ntrial (NCT06088654), investigating the safety and tolerability of IPH6501 in patients with Relapsed and/\nor Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The study is ongoing and planned to\nenroll up to 184 patients.\nAntibody Drug Conjugates\na. Proprietary\nTo further our R&D program, the Company continues to develop different approaches for the treatment of\ncancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets, with its innovative ANKET®\nplatform and continuing to explore Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats. The Company has a\nrobust pipeline of additional preclinical product candidates. Its additional disclosed preclinical pipeline\nincludes :\n– IPH45 is Innate’s proprietary pre-IND anti-Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate including\na Topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. IPH45 is progressing towards the clinic with IND targeted\nin 2024.\n– IPH43, an anti-MICA/B ADC.\nInnate will share first preclinical data with IPH45 in an oral presentation at the American Association for\nCancer Research (AACR) 2024.\nb. Partnered\nInnate announced in April 2023 that it granted Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop\nADC using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a primary focus in\nCeliac disease.\n110\nTakeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and commercialization of any\npotential products developed using the licensed antibodies.\nUnder the terms of the license agreement, Innate has received an upfront payment of $5 million and is\neligible to receive up to $410 million in future development, regulatory and commercial milestones if all\nmilestones are achieved during the term of the agreement, plus royalties on potential net sales of any\ncommercial product resulting from the license.\nNext Step\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, and notably the cancer field, is characterized by rapidly\nadvancing technologies, products protected by intellectual property rights and intense competition and is\nsubject to significant and rapid changes as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new\ntechnologies and treatments. While the Company believes that its technology, knowledge, experience,\ncollaborations and scientific resources provide Innate with competitive advantages, the Company faces\npotential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public\nand private research institutions. Any approved product that Innate Pharma commercializes will compete\nwith existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nA large number of companies are developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of their competitors have significantly greater\nexperience, personnel and resources as they relate to research, drug development, manufacturing and\nmarketing. In particular, large pharmaceutical laboratories have substantially more experience than the\nCompany does in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory authorizations. Mergers and\nacquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more\nresources being concentrated among a smaller number of its competitors. Smaller or early-stage\ncompanies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements\nwith large and established companies. These competitors are also likely to compete with Innate to recruit\nand retain top qualified scientific and management personnel, acquire rights for promising product\ncandidates and technologies, establish clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, acquire\n111\ntechnologies complementary to, or necessary for, its programs and enter into collaborations with potential\npartners who have access to innovative technologies.\nInnate's commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and\ncommercialize products that are more effective, have a better safety profile, are more convenient, have a\nbroader label, have more robust intellectual property protection or are less expensive than any products\nthat the Company may develop. Its competitors also may obtain regulatory approval for their products\nmore rapidly than the Company may obtain approval for its products, which could result in its\ncompetitors establishing a strong market position before the Company is able to enter the market. In\naddition, its competitors could be more efficient in manufacturing or more effective in marketing their\nown products than the Company or its partners may be in the future.\nWith respect to its lead product candidate, lacutamab, a monoclonal antibody product candidate targeting\nKIR3DL2, the Company is aware of several pharmaceutical companies marketing and developing\nproducts for the treatment of patients with CTCL, including MF and Sézary syndrome, and PTCL. The\nlatest drugs approved by the FDA for CTCL are: Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), marketed by Seattle\nGenetics and approved in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of patients with primary\ncutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing MF who have received prior\nsystemic therapy, and Poteligeo (mogamulizumab), marketed by Kyowa Kirin and approved for the\ntreatment of adult patients with R/R MF or Sézary syndrome after at least one prior systemic therapy.\nZolinza (vorinostat) is the only drug approved by the FDA for CTCL patients after two prior failures. In\nthe second line setting of PTCL, Beleodaq (belinostat), Folotyn (pralatrexate) and Istodax (romidepsin)\nhave all been approved by the FDA; however, none of these treatments have been approved by the EMA.\nWith respect to monalizumab, a novel dual-targeting checkpoint inhibitor, other anti-NKG2A have started\nto be assessed in clinical trials, and several pharmaceutical companies are marketing and developing\ntreatments for either NSCLC. Currently two ongoing clinical trials are assessing other anti-NKG2A\nmolecules. A Phase 1/2 is assessing BMS-986315 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) monotherapy or in combination\nwith nivolumab or cetuximab in patients with solid tumors. A Phase 1 study is assessing S095029\n(Servier) monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD-1 in patients with solid tumors with dose\nexpansion cohorts that add an anti-HER2 or anti-EGFR to the doublet. A Phase 1 study is evaluating\nBRY805 (BioRay Pharmaceutical Co.) as monotherapy in patients with solid tumours. Exelis and Invenra\nare collaborating to develop a bispecific targeting PD-L1 and NKG2A which is in the preclinical setting.\nThere are also several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are focused on the tumor\nmicroenvironment, including the complement and the adenosine pathways. Many companies are active in\nthe adenosine pathway, targeting CD73, CD39 or the adenosine receptors. For example, AstraZeneca and\nI-Mab Biopharma U.S. Limited each have anti-CD73 product candidates in Phase 2 clinical development,\nand several other biotechnology companies are active in the adenosine pathway area, including Trishula\nTherapeutics, Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Arcus Biosciences Inc.\nNK cells have been increasingly researched and the Company is aware of many companies activating\nand /or harnessing NK cells to target and kill cancer cells through different approaches such as cell\ntherapies (for example, Fate Therapeutics, Inc. and NKarta, Inc.) and multi-specifics (for example,\nAffimed N.V. and Dragonfly Therapeutics, Inc.).\nIntellectual Property\nCommercial success of the Company depends in part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret\nand other intellectual property and proprietary protection of its technology, current and future products\nand product candidates and methods used to develop and manufacture them.

Other patent rights include\nU.S. Patent No. 11,572,410, European patent 3 193 931 B1 and counterpart patents in certain other\ncountries relating to use of monalizumab in combination with agents that neutralize PD-1 or PDL1, which\npatents are solely owned by us and have a statutory expiration date in 2035, not including patent term\nadjustment or any potential patent term extension.\nLacutamab/Anti-KIR3DL2\nAs of December 31, 2023, the principal intellectual property rights related to lacutamab are wholly owned\nby Innate and include U.S. Patent Nos. 10,280,222 and 11,066,470, European patent EP 3 116 908 B1 and\ncounterpart patent applications in certain other countries. These patents and patent applications are\ndirected to the composition of matter of lacutamab, and such patents have, and any patents that issue from\nsuch applications would have, a statutory expiration date in 2035, not including patent term adjustment or\nany potential patent term extension.\n113\nIPH5201/Anti-CD39\nAs of December 31, 2023, the principal intellectual property rights related to IPH5201 are co-owned by\nInnate together with Orega Biotech, and include U.S. patent No. 11,377,503, one European patent\napplication, and other patent applications in certain other countries. These patents and patent applications\nare directed to the composition of matter of IPH5201, and such have, and any patents that issue from such\npatent application would have, a statutory expiration date in 2039, not including patent term adjustment or\nany potential patent term extension.\nIPH5301/Anti-CD73\nAs of December 31, 2023, the principal intellectual property rights related to IPH5301 are solely owned\nby us, and include one U.S. non-provisional patent application, one European patent application, and\nother patent applications in certain other countries. If a patent directed to IPH5301 issues from such U.S.\npatent application, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2040, not including patent term adjustment\nor any potential patent term extension.\nIPH6501\nAs of December 31, 2023, the principal intellectual property rights related to IPH6501 are solely owned\nby us, and include one U.S. non-provisional patent application, one European patent application, and\nother patent applications in certain other countries. If a patent directed to IPH6501 issues from such U.S.\npatent application, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2042, not including patent term adjustment\nor any potential patent term extension.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are\nobtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest\nclaimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application or its foreign equivalent in the applicable\ncountry. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term\nadjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and\ngranting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent\nor a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. In the United States, a patent\nmay also be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term\nRestoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a\npatent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory\nreview process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14\nyears from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may\nbe extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for\nmanufacturing it may be extended.\nTrademarks\nThe Company owns the mark INNATE PHARMA in the United States, Australia and Europe (EU\ncommunity trademark), and INNATE in Europe (EU community trademark). The Company also owns\nregistrations for the mark ANKET® respectively in the United States and Europe (EU community\ntrademark), the marks LONKIRLO and KIRTAMSY in France.\n114\nRegulation\nResearch and development work, preclinical tests, clinical studies, facilities, and the manufacture and sale\nof its products are and will continue to be subject to the complex legislative and regulatory provisions\nimplemented by the various competent authorities in Europe, the United States and other countries. The\nEMA, FDA and the various national regulatory authorities impose considerable constraints on the\ndevelopment, manufacture and sale of products that the Company develops and clinical trials it conducts.\nIn case of non-compliance with these laws or regulations, the regulatory authorities may impose fines,\nseize or withdraw products from the market or even partially or totally suspend their production. They\nmay also revoke previously granted marketing authorizations and reject applications seeking\nauthorization. These legal and regulatory constraints are important in considering whether an\ninvestigational product can ultimately become an approved, commercialized drug, as well as for\nrecognizing the time and investments necessary for such development.\nAlthough there are differences from one country to another, the development of therapeutic products for\nhuman use is subject to similar procedures and companies must comply with the same types of\nregulations in all ICH countries (countries that are part of the International Council for Harmonisation of\nTechnical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use). In order to obtain\nmarketing authorization for a product, proof of its efficacy and safety should be provided by the applicant,\nalong with detailed information on its composition and manufacturing process. This entails significant\npharmaceutical and preclinical developments, clinical trials and laboratory tests. The development of a\nnew drug from basic research to commercial marketing generally comprises five steps: (i) research, (ii)\npreclinical trials, (iii) clinical trials in humans, (iv) marketing authorization and (v) marketing.\nPreclinical studies\nPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured substance\nor active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to\nassess the safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a\nrationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to national regulations and\nrequirements, including Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations. The results of the preclinical tests,\ntogether with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans\nfor clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the applicable regulatory agency in connection\nwith the application to begin human testing. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of\nreproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after\nsubmission of the application.\nRegulation of clinical trials\nIn humans, clinical trials are usually carried out in three Phases that are generally sequential, but under\ncertain circumstances Phases of trials can overlap or even be skipped, following a specific review and\ndetermination by regulatory agencies. Clinical trials are sometimes necessary or required by regulatory\nauthorities after marketing authorization to explain certain side-effects, investigate a specific\npharmacological effect or obtain more accurate or additional data. Additional trials are also commonly\nconducted to explore new indications. Regulatory authorization and ethics approvals are needed to carry\nout clinical trials. The regulatory authorities may put on clinical hold, block, suspend or require\nsignificant modifications to the clinical study protocols submitted by companies seeking to test products,\nincluding the imposition of clinical holds before or after a clinical trial has commenced.\n115\nClinical trial authorization in the European Union\nIn the European Union, clinical trials are governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014\n(CTR), which entered into application on January 31, 2022, repealing and replacing the former Clinical\nTrials Directive 2001/20 (CTD) and related national implementing legislation of EU Member States.\nThe CTR applies to interventional clinical trials on medicinal products and to clinical trials authorized\nunder the CTD with a three-year transition period from the CTR that has come into operation. As from\nJanuary 31, 2023, all new clinical trial applications are registered pursuant to the CTR. Trials approved\nunder the CTD before January 30, 2023 can continue to be regulated under the CTD until January 30,\n2025.\nThe CTR allows better consistency throughout EU Member States:\n• Single submission of the clinical trial application dossier through the EU Clinical Trials\nInformation System (Article 5) including a common part assessed jointly by all participating\nEU Member States, and a national part covering the ethical and operational aspects of the trial\nassessed by each EU Member State independently.\n• A clinical trial authorization issued in the form of a single decision.\nThe CTR applies in the Member States without the requirement for separate implementing legislation by\neach Member State, but some of the existing laws of the Member States applicable at a national level will\ncontinue to apply.\nThis regulation is intended to increase transparency of authorized clinical trials in the European Union:\nthe EU Clinical Trials Information System serves as the source of public information, without prejudice\nof personal data protection, commercially confidential information protection, and protection of\nconfidential communication and trial supervision between Member States. Public information includes\nclinical trial authorization information, protocol data, and a summary of the results 12 months after the\nend of the trial (or six months in case of pediatric clinical trials).\nClinical trial authorization in the United States\nIn the United States, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application must be submitted to the FDA and\naccepted before clinical trials can start on humans. An IND is an exemption from the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act (FDCA) that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate\ncommerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an\ninvestigational product to humans. This application contains early research data as well as the\npharmaceutical dossier, preclinical and clinical data (if any) and includes the clinical protocol. If there is\nno objection from the FDA, the IND application becomes valid 30 days after it is received by the FDA.\nThis waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human\nresearch subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during or subsequent to this\n30-day period, the FDA may request the suspension or clinical hold of clinical trials, whether such trials\nare planned or in progress, and may request additional information. This temporary suspension (clinical\nhold) continues until the FDA receives the information it has requested.\nIn addition to the foregoing IND requirements, one or more independent institutional review board (IRB)\ncovering each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any\nclinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and\nreapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study\nprotocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in\ncompliance with FDA regulations and other application regulations and internal compliance procedures.\nAn IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it\n116\nrepresents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the\nproduct candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nThe FDA’s primary objectives in reviewing an IND are to assure the safety and rights of patients and to\nhelp assure that the quality of the investigation will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the biological\nproduct’s safety, purity and potency. The decision to suspend or terminate development of an\ninvestigational biological product may be made by either a health authority body such as the FDA, an\nIRB, or by Innate for various reasons. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of\nqualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee\n(DSMB). This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated\ncheck points based on data from the study that is made available to such DSMB for such purpose.\nSuspension or termination of development during any Phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined\nthat the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for\nsuspension or termination may be made by Innate based on evolving business objectives and/or the\ncompetitive climate.\nGood clinical practices (GCP)\nIn most countries, clinical trials also must comply with the current GCP, or cGCP, standards as defined by\nthe International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of\nPharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Directive 2005/28/EC dated April 8, 2005 adopted the cGCP\nprinciples in the context of strengthening the regulatory structure specified by Directive 2001/20/EC. In\nthe US, ICH GCP standards are adopted by FDA as guidance. The competent authority designated in each\nMember State to authorize clinical trials must take into consideration, among other factors, the scientific\nvalue of the study, the safety of the drug and the possible responsibility of the clinical site.\nConducting clinical trials\nClinical trials must be carried out in compliance with complex regulations throughout the various Phases\nof clinical development, based on the principle of informed consent by the patient to whom the products\nwill be administered.\nClinical trial Phases\nClinical trials may be conducted in the United States, in Europe or in other parts of the world as long as\nsuch trials have been approved by health authorities and ethics committees or IRBs in each country where\nthe trial is conducted. There are three well-established and internationally recognized clinical Phases:\nPhase 1, 2 and 3. This classification is used by the FDA and the EMA, as well as other regulatory\nagencies. Each of these clinical Phases is described below.\n• Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested\nfor safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of\nsome products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the\nproduct may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial\nhuman testing is often conducted with patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1\ntrials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing,\npharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate\nbiomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific\ntypes of diseases.\n• Phase 2: This Phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible\nadverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for\nspecific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage.\n117\n• Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety\nin an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These\nclinical trials, generally comparative, are intended to demonstrate the overall risk-benefit ratio\nof the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after marketing approval\nis obtained. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the\nintended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the applicable regulator may mandate the\nperformance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval.\nIn specific situations, certain Phases of development can be merged or even skipped when clear signs of\nefficacy emerge in the early Phases of development and the product candidate is designed for patients\nwith major unmet medical needs. However, these deviations from the standard pattern of development\nmust be discussed and approved by health authorities. Given the high unmet medical need for certain\ncancer patients, deviations from the typical Phases of development are frequent in oncology and\nparticularly in the field of immunotherapy.\nDisclosure of clinical trial information\nSponsors of applicable clinical trials of FDA-regulated drugs are required to register and disclose certain\nclinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Similarly, in Europe,\nSponsors are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a single portal, CTIS\n(Clinical Trial Information System), replacing Eudra-CT, set up by the European Medicines Agency\n(EMA). CTIS is a single entry point centralizing information and databases on clinical trials in the EU.\nEudra-CT will be definitively abandoned at the end of the transition period, i.e., on January 30, 2025.\nInformation related to the product, patient population, Phase of investigation, study sites and\ninvestigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.\nSponsors of applicable clinical trials are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials within\na certain timeframe after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials may be delayed until the new\nproduct or new indication being studied has been approved, subject to time-based limitations.\nCompetitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of\ndevelopment programs.\nRegulations concerning marketing authorizations\nIn order to be marketed, a drug product must have regulatory authorization (known as approval of a New\nDrug Application (NDA) or licensure of a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the United States, a\nMarketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European Union and a Great Britain Marketing\nAuthorisation Application). The competent authorities are the FDA in the United States, the EMA in the\nEuropean Union and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United\nKingdom. Companies apply for a marketing authorization based on quality, safety and efficacy data. In\nthe European Union, the United States and Japan, the dossier is a standard dossier referred to as a CTD, or\nCommon Technical Document. Generally, the dossier describes the manufacturing of the drug substance\n(active substance), the manufacturing of the final product and the clinical and non-clinical studies\ncommon to all jurisdictions while providing a separate module for region-specific information.\nUnited States review and approval process for biological products\nIn the United States, the FDA licenses complex biological products under the Public Health Service Act,\nor PHSA. In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be\nsubmitted to the FDA with data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological\nproduct for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent\npreclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings,\n118\ntogether with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and\nproposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to\ntest the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including\nstudies initiated by investigators. To support marketing authorization, the data submitted must be\nsufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the\nsatisfaction of the FDA.\nThe BLA is the vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new\nbiological product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new\nbiological product candidate must be the subject of an approved BLA before it may be commercialized in\nthe United States. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee\nand the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program user fees. These fees typically\nincrease annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an\nexception from the application fee for products with orphan drug designation and a waiver for certain\nsmall businesses, an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in\nmanufacturing the product during a particular fiscal year, and an exception from the product fee for a\nproduct that is the same as another product approved under an abbreviated pathway.\nFollowing submission of a BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally\nwithin 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor, via the \"Day 74 Letter,\" by the\n74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission of whether the application is sufficiently complete to\npermit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application\nfor filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The\nresubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission\nis accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified\nperformance goals in the BLA review process. Under that agreement, FDA committed to review and act\non 90% of applications seeking approval of original BLA's within 10 months of the filing date and on\n90% of original BLA submissions that have been designated for “priority review” within six months of\nthe filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for an original\napplication may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or\nclarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA\nfollowing the original submission.\nBefore approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product\nis or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with a BLA\nsubmission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing, and control testing\nlaboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing\nprocesses and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent\nproduction of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA\nwill typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.\nAs a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a Risk Evaluation and\nMitigation Strategy (REMS). REMS are required risk management plans that use risk mitigation\nstrategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the\npotential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population\nlikely to use the product, seriousness of the disease/condition to be treated, expected benefit of the\nproduct, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether\nthe product is a new molecular entity.\nTo support its evaluation, the FDA may request advice from an advisory committee. Preliminary plans on\nwhether to hold an advisory committee are included in the Day 74 Letter. The FDA requests advice from\nadvisory committees on a variety of matters, including various aspects of clinical investigations and\n119\napplications for marketing approval of drug products. Advisory committee members are scientific experts\nsuch as physician-researchers and statisticians, as well as representatives of the public, including patients.\nThe FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations carefully when making decisions.\nOn the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the\nresults of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a\ncomplete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific\nprescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the\ndeficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for\nthe FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s\nsatisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed\nto reviewing and acting on 90% of such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of\ninformation included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may\ndecide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nIf the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that\ncontraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval\nstudies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the product’s safety after approval,\nrequire testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other\nconditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS,\nwhich can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or\nlimit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance\nprograms.\nRegistration procedures in the European Union\nTo access the European markets through community procedures, drug products must be submitted\nthrough the Centralized Procedure, the Mutual Recognition Procedure or the Decentralized Procedure.\nThe process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 31, 2004 provides\nfor the Centralized Procedure. The Centralized Procedure results in a single MA, granted by the European\nCommission that is valid across the European Economic Area or EEA (i.e., the European Union as well as\nIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The Centralized Procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are:\n(i) derived from biotechnology processes, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment\nof certain diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and\nother immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated orphan medicines and\n(iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered\nmedicines.\nUnder Article 3 of the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Centralized Procedure is optional for any other\nhuman medicinal product if: (1) the medicinal product contains a new active substance ; or (2) the\napplicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical\ninnovation or that the granting of authorization in accordance with this Regulation is in the interests of\npatients health at the EU level.\nUnder the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), shall\nensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), is given within\n210 days (Article 6.3). This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral\ninformation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP (Article 7). At\nthe end of the review period, the CHMP provides its opinion through a scientific assessment report to the\nEuropean Commission. The Commission may then adopt a final decision to grant an MA. Once granted,\n120\nthe MA is valid across all EEA countries for an initial period of five years. Since 2008, as a consequence\nof a European directive, a marketing authorization is now renewed only once, five years after the initial\nregistration. The marketing authorization shall be then valid for an unlimited period, unless the\nCommission decides, on justified grounds, relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional\nfive-year renewal.\nNational MAs, issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA, are also available;\nhowever these only cover their respective territory. National MAs may be applied for through the Mutual\nRecognition Procedure or Decentralized Procedure in order that multiple competent authorities in\ndifferent member states of the EEA may each issue a national MA in their territory for the same product\non the back of the same application. National MAs are only available for products not falling within the\nmandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure.\nIt is possible for a drug to be withdrawn from the market, upon the request of the health authorities, if a\nserious problem arises, in particular a safety-related problem. The marketing authorization is then\ncancelled. There can be various reasons for the withdrawal of drugs from the market, with the main\nreasons being public health, major undesirable side effects and non-compliance with manufacturing rules.\nNon-standard regulatory procedures\nAside from the standard procedures of granting a BLA or a European MA, as described above, non-\nstandard regulatory procedures allow a shorter time-to-market for new medicines.\nThe following programs that are in place in the United States are intended to facilitate the development\nand/or expedite the review and potential approval of drug products:\n• Accelerated Approval: FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-\nthreatening disease or condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a\nsurrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint\nthat can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely\nto predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into\naccount the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of\nalternative treatments. This procedure is somewhat comparable to the “conditional approval”\nin the European Union.\n• Priority Review: An application for a drug will receive priority review designation if it is for a\ndrug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement\nin safety or effectiveness. Priority Review provides for a shorter review clock: the time it takes\nFDA to review a filed BLA is reduced to six months rather than 10 months. This procedure is\nsomewhat comparable to the “accelerated assessment” in the European Union.\n• The Fast Track Designation: Section 506(b) of the FDCA provides for the designation of a\ndrug as a fast track product “if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or\nmore other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it\ndemonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.”\nThis provision is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat\nserious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market\nexpeditiously. For fast track designated drugs, sponsors may have a higher number of\ninteractions with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may review sections of the BLA for a fast\ntrack designated drug on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. Fast\ntrack designation may be rescinded if the qualifying criteria are no longer met. Fast Track\ndesignation does not necessarily lead to a Priority Review or Accelerated Approval.\n121\n• The Breakthrough Therapy Designation: Section 506(a) of the FDCA provides for designation\nof a drug as a breakthrough therapy “if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one\nor more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary\nclinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over\nexisting therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment\neffects observed early in clinical development.” The standard for breakthrough therapy\ndesignation is not the same as the standard for drug approval as the clinical evidence needed to\nsupport breakthrough designation is preliminary. In contrast, as is the case for all drugs, FDA\nwill review the full data submitted to support approval of drugs designated as breakthrough\ntherapies to determine whether the drugs are safe and effective for their intended use before\nthey are approved for marketing. The program provides the same advantages of the fast track\ndesignation, but also includes intensive FDA guidance to promote efficient development and\nFDA organizational commitment. Breakthrough therapy designation may be rescinded if the\nqualifying criteria are no longer met.\nIn the European Union, non-standard registration procedures under the Centralized Procedures are as\nfollows:\n• Conditional marketing authorization: valid one year (instead of five). It is granted only if the\nbenefit / risk ratio is positive, if the product addresses unmet medical needs, and if the benefits\nto public health outweigh the risks associated with uncertainty because of an incomplete\nevaluation of the drug (for instance, because of clinical trials still ongoing at the time of the\nevaluation, or when additional clinical trials are needed). It is renewed annually if an\nappropriate report is submitted annually by the sponsor. Once the results of the pending\nstudies are provided, it can become a “regular” marketing authorization.\n• Approval under exceptional circumstances: a marketing authorization may be granted in\nexceptional cases, reviewed each year to reassess the risk-benefit balance when the initial\ndossier for assessment of the drug cannot contain all required data, for instance when the\ncondition to be treated is rarely encountered.\n• Accelerated assessment : the evaluation process is accelerated (150 days instead of 210 days)\nwhen a drug is of major interest from the standpoint of public health or in particular from the\nviewpoint of therapeutic innovation.\n• The PRIME (priority medicines) scheme refers to a process for enhanced interactions and\nearly dialogue with EMA to facilitate the development and speed up examination of drugs\nwhich target unmet medical needs or offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing\ntreatments. Through PRIME, drug developers can expect to be eligible for accelerated\nassessment at the time of application for a marketing authorization.\nAs part of the EU pharmaceuticals strategy, the EU Commission worked on a revision of the EU’s general\nlegislation on medicines for human use. On April 26, 2023 the EU Commission adopted a Directive\nproposal and a Regulation proposal, which represent the largest pharmaceutical reform in over 20 years.\nThe revision will impact the global legal framework for medicinal products in the EU, including\nlegislation relating to Orphan and pediatric drugs and will review the incentives system (data protection\nand market exclusivity) in place.\nOrphan drugs\nGenerally, orphan drugs are drugs used for the prevention or treatment of life-threatening or serious rare\nconditions.\n122\nIn the United States, the 1983 Orphan Drug Act was passed to encourage the development of drugs for\nrare disease or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is defined as a disease that\naffects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 but there is no\nreasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available a drug for such disease or\ncondition in the United States will be recovered from U.S. sales of the drug. The FDA has authority to\ngrant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product to prevent, diagnose or treat a rare disease\nor condition, a designation which carries with it the following incentives: the possibility of obtaining\nresearch grants from the American government for clinical trials; tax credits for a portion of research\ncosts; a possible exemption from user fees; and the potential for a seven-year period of exclusivity if a\nmarketing authorization is granted.\nRegarding orphan drug exclusivity, if a product with orphan drug designation receives the first FDA\napproval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use\nwithin the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product will generally receive orphan\ndrug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s\nmarketing application for the same drug for the same use or indication for seven years, except in certain\nlimited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the\nsame rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different\nindications. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an\nindication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to\nexclusivity.\nOrphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a\nsubsequent product that is the same biologic for the same use or indication is shown to be clinically\nsuperior to the approved product on the basis of greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater\nsafety in a substantial portion of the target populations, or demonstration of a major contribution to\npatient care. Additionally, FDA may approve another application for the same biologic for the same use\nor condition notwithstanding the applicability of orphan drug exclusivity, if the company with orphan\ndrug exclusivity is not able to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug.\nIn the European Union, equivalent legislation has been adopted to promote treatments for rare diseases\n(Regulation 141/2000/EC of December 16, 1999, as amended by Regulation 847/2000/EC of April 27,\n2000). A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if: (a) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention\nor treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in\n10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) it is intended for the\ndiagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic\ncondition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the\nmedicinal product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary\ninvestment.\nFor either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of\ndiagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if\nsuch method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.\nMedicinal products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive 10 years of market\nexclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product can be submitted for the same therapeutic\nindication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the\nEuropean Union for pediatric studies (in this case for orphan drugs no extension to any supplementary\nprotection certificate can be granted, see further detail below). Orphan medicinal products are also\neligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and scientific assistance for study\nproposals. (Articles 6 and 9 of the above-mentioned regulation). The application for orphan drug\n123\ndesignation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization (Article 5). The\napplicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug\ndesignation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing\nauthorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the\nduration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nThe 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established\nthat the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is\nsufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity (Article 8). However, marketing\nauthorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication at any time if:\n• the holder of the marketing authorization, or MA, for the original orphan medicinal product\nhas given its consent to the second applicant;\n• the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient\nquantities of the orphan medicinal product; or\n• the second applicant can establish in the application that its product, although similar to the\norphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically\nsuperior.\nRegistration procedures outside of the European Union and the United States\nIn addition to regulation in the United States and the European Union, a variety of foreign regulations\ngovern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of drugs. Pharmaceutical firms who wish to\nmarket their medicinal drugs outside the European Union and the United States must submit marketing\nauthorization application to the national authorities of the concerned countries, such as the Pharmaceutical\nand Medical Device Agency (PMDA) in Japan. The approval process varies from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA or European\nCommission.\nOf note, in the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland), Great Britain is no\nlonger covered by EU centralized procedures for MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, EU\ncentralized procedures for MAs continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). For a period of two years\nfrom January 1, 2021, when determining an application for a Great Britain Marketing Authorization, the\nMHRA was allowed to rely on on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a\nnew MA in the centralized procedure (the European Decision Reliance Procedure). On January 1, 2024, a\nnew international recognition framework procedure (IRP) replaced the European Decision Reliance\nProcedure. Under the IRP, the MHRA may take into account the approval of MAs made by the EMA and\ncertain other regulators. The MHRA also has the power to take into account MAs approved in EU\nMember States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly\ngranting an MA in the United Kingdom.\nPost-approval regulations\nPost-approval regulation in the United States\nBiologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA licensure are subject to pervasive and continuing\nregulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic\nreporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse\nexperiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new\nindications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also\ncontinuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such\n124\nproducts are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical\ndata.\nIn addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved\nproducts are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to\nperiodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and aforementioned state agencies for compliance with\ndrug manufacturing regulations, including current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Changes to the\nmanufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being\nimplemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP\nand impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party\nmanufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory\nrequirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of\nunanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements, may result in revising the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposing post-\nmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposing distribution or other restrictions\nunder a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or\ncomplete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n• fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n• refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved BLAs, or\nsuspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug\nMarketing Act (PDMA) and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act\n(DSCSA), which respectively regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the\nfederal level and set floor and ceiling standards for the regulation of wholesale distributors by the states.\nPDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical\nproduct samples, and DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability during distribution and to\nidentify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market, each among other\nobjectives.\nThe FDA strictly regulates labels/labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs that are placed\non the market. The FDA-required labeling sets forth the conditions of use under which the licensed\nbiologics has been shown to meet the relevant standard for marketing and provides directions and\ninformation on how to use the product safely and effectively under those conditions. Licensed biologics\nmay be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved\nlabel, including information consistent with the FDA required labeling and not otherwise false or\nmisleading. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the\npromotion of off-label uses. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be\nsubject to significant liability.\nPatent term restoration and extension in the United States\nA patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the\nHatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during\n125\nproduct development and the FDA regulatory review period. A regulatory review period consists of two\nperiods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. The restoration period granted on a patent\ncovering a product is calculated as one-half the testing phase (the time between the exemption to permit\nthe clinical investigations of the drug product becomes effective and start of the approval phase) plus the\napproval phase (the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date). A\nmaximum of five years can be restored to a patent and patent term extension cannot be used to extend the\nremaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Additionally, only\none patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, the application for the extension\nmust be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question, and only those claims covering the\napproved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. A patent that\ncovers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the\napprovals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration\nin consultation with the FDA. For more information regarding the risks related to patent term restoration\nand extension, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property Rights—If the Company\ndoes not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar non-U.S. legislation for\nextending the term of patents covering Lumoxiti and each of its product candidates, its business may be\nmaterially harmed.”\nHealthcare law and regulation in the United States\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription\nof biologic products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-\nparty payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims\nlaws, transparency laws and patient data privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and\nregulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable\nfederal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n• the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from\nknowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration,\ndirectly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual\nfor, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may\nbe made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and\nMedicaid;\n• the U.S. civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil\nmonetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things,\nknowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for\npayment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be\nmade or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay\nmoney to the federal government;\n• the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created\nadditional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully\nexecuting, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or\nmaking false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n• HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health\nAct, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule\npublished in January 2013, which impose obligations on covered entities and their business\nassociates, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy,\nsecurity and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n126\n• the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act,\nunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care\nEducation Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs,\ndevices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) within the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to\nphysicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by\nphysicians and their immediate family members; and\n• analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims\nlaws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-\ngovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s\nvoluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal\ngovernment in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians\nand other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Certain state laws require the reporting of\ninformation relating to drug and biologic pricing; and some state and local laws require the registration of\npharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health\ninformation in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often\nare not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nFailure to comply with these laws or any other governmental regulations as applicable, could result in the\nimposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement,\nimprisonment, possible exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and\nMedicaid, additional integrity reporting requirements and oversight, as well as contractual damages,\nreputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations.\nHealthcare reform in the United States\nA primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have\nbeen a number of federal and state proposals and changes during the last few years regarding the pricing\nof pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for biologics\nand other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United\nStates.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA, which includes a number of healthcare\nreform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The ACA, among other\nthings, imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription\ndrug products; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the\nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or\ninjected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care\norganizations; and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which\nmanufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand\ndrugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s\noutpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance\nalso have been added, which may require modification of business practices with healthcare practitioners.\nThe ACA also revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could\nincrease the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states.\nThere have been judicial, congressional, and executive branch efforts to repeal, modify or delay the\nimplementation of the law. In July and December 2018, CMS published final rules with respect to\n127\npermitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health\ninsurance issuers under its risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court\nlitigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. While Congress has not\npassed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the\nACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that repealed,\neffective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain\nindividuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that, commonly\nreferred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled\nthat the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by the U.S.\nCongress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety\nbecause the \"individual mandate\" was repealed by Congress. Thus the ACA remains in effect in its\ncurrent form. It is unclear how judicial and Congressional challenges and other efforts to repeal and\nreplace the ACA will impact the ACA. The Company continues to evaluate how the ACA and recent\nefforts to limit the implementation of the ACA will impact its business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was\nenacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included\naggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers and suppliers of 2% per fiscal year, starting in\n2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032,\nunless additional Congressional action is taken .\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers,\nincluding hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations\nperiod for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nFurthermore, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with\nrespect to drug pricing practices. There have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and\nproposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs,\nreduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies\nfor drugs.\nFor example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. This legislation\ncontains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program\nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a\nnegotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the\nestablishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare\nParts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide\ndiscounts on Part D drugs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ annual\nout-of-pocket drug expenses. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the IRA drug\npricing provisions. Provisions of the IRA are subject to legal challenges, and the full impact of the IRA\non the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\nThe U.S. Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new\nlegislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed\nto control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement\nconstraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and\nbulk purchasing.\n128\nPharmacovigilance system in the European Union\nAn MA holder in the EU must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an\nindividual qualified person for pharmacovigilance (QPPV), who is responsible for oversight of the\npharmacovigilance system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse\nreactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).\nAll new MA applications must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management\nsystem that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks\nassociated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a\ncondition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include\nadditional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs or the conduct of additional clinical\ntrials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties\nrequesting access, subject to limited redactions.\nAdvertising regulation in the European Union\nAll advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary\nof product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer\nadvertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general\nrequirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union\ndirectives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ\nfrom one country to another.\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, the Company may be\nsubject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products,\noperating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nPharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement\nEuropean Union\nIn the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. In\nsome countries, products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some\ncountries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a\nparticular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in\norder to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for\nits member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems\nprovide reimbursement for and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European\nUnion member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct\nor indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member\nstates allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes\nand issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union\nhave increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as\ncountries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt\ncrises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs\nin general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers\nare being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may\nfurther complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has\nbeen obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e.,\narbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no\nassurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical\n129\nproducts will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in\nthose countries.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, patients who have treatments prescribed for their conditions and providers\nperforming the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the\nassociated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of\nproducts approved by the FDA. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will\ndepend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the\nUnited States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care\norganizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The\nprocess for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the\nprocess for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is\napproved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical\nnecessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to\nmanage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known\nas a formulary, which may not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.\nIn order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a\ncompany may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical\nnecessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other\ncomparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically\nnecessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could\nreduce physician utilization once the product is approved, which could have a material adverse effect on\nsales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage\nfor a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s\ndetermination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide\ncoverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ\nsignificantly from payor to payor.\nThe containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments\nand the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in\nimplementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and\nrequirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment\nmeasures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures,\ncould further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage\npolicies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and\nreimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators\nreceive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be\nimplemented in the future.\nAnti-corruption, anti-kickback and transparency regulations\nArrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers can expose\npharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare\nlaws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships\nthrough which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products.\nMore specifically, each of the above-mentioned steps of the development of therapeutic products for\nhuman use is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials which is\nlikely to cause a risk of corruption or bribery. For instance, in many countries, hospitals are operated by\nthe government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain\n130\npayments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper\npayments to government officials and have led to enforcement actions. That is why business activity may\nbe subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which the\nCompany operates, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act\nor the French Sapin 2 Law.\nThese statutes generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of\nvalue, either directly or indirectly, to a government or a foreign government official or employees of\npublic international organizations in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain\nbusiness. The implementation of these statutes may also impose internal compliance programs,\nprocedures and guidelines to detect and report any suspicious activities and to mitigate any risks of\nnoncompliance which may occur.\nIn addition, the Company may be subject to specific healthcare regulations, including, without limitation:\n• the French “transparency” provisions, or “French Sunshine Act” (Articles L. 1453-1 and\nD. 1453-1 and seq. of the French Public Health Code or PHC), which contains provisions\nregarding transparency of fees received by some healthcare professionals from industries, i.e.\ncompanies manufacturing or marketing healthcare products (medicinal products, medical\ndevices, etc.) in France. According to the provisions, these companies shall publicly disclose\n(on a specific public website available at https://transparence.sante.gouv.fr) the advantages and\nfees paid to healthcare professionals amounting to €10 or above, as well as the agreements\nconcluded with the latter, along with detailed information about each agreement (the precise\nsubject matter of the agreement, the date of signature of the agreement, its end date, the total\namount paid to the healthcare professional, etc.); and\n• the French “anti-gift” provisions (Articles L.1453-3 to L.1453-12 PHC), setting out a general\nprohibition of payments and rewards from industries, i.e. companies manufacturing or\nmarketing health products to healthcare professionals (HCP), healthcare organizations (HCO),\nhealthcare associations and students with limited exceptions, and strictly defining the\nconditions under which such payments or awards are lawful. The regime entails strict\nformalities depending on the amount paid, when authorized, to the HCP, HCO, students or\nassociations.\nData protection rules\nThe Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that came into\nforce on May 25, 2018, as well as EU Member State implementing legislations, apply to the collection\nand processing of personal data, including health-related information, by companies located in the EU, or\nin certain circumstances, by companies located outside of the EU and processing personal information of\nindividuals located in the EU.\nThese laws impose strict obligations on the ability to process personal data, including health-related\ninformation, in particular in relation to their collection, use, disclosure and transfer.\nAlso, in certain countries, in particular France, the conduct of clinical trials is subject to compliance with\nspecific provisions of the Act No.78-17 of January 6, 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and\nCivil Liberties, as amended. These provisions require, among others, the filing of compliance\nundertakings with “standard methodologies” and a specific framework applicable to the retention of\npersonal data when researching in the health sector (July 2020) adopted by the French Data Protection\nAuthority (the CNIL), or, if not compliant, obtaining a specific authorization from the CNIL.\n131\nThe most common standard methodologies are the following:\n• Decision No. 2018-153 of May 3, 2018 concerning the approval of a standard methodology for\nthe processing of personal data carried out within the context of research in the field of clinical\ntrials, which requires the express consent of the person involved (standard methodology\nMR-001)\n• Decision No. 2018-154 of May 3, 2018 concerning the approval of a standard methodology for\nthe processing of personal data in the context of research in the field of health, which does not\nrequire the express consent of the person involved (methodology MR-003).\nDeliberation no. 2020-077 of June 18, 2020 adopting a framework relating to the retention periods of\npersonal data processed for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health.\nIn certain specific cases, entities processing health personal data may have to comply with article L1111-8\nof the French Public Health Code which imposes certain certifications for the hosting service providers.\nC.

Factors that could cause or\ncontribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in sections titled “Item 3.D – Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.” The Company audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB,\nwhich may differ in material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in other\njurisdictions, including the United States.\nOverview\nInnate is a global, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.\nIts innovative approach aims to harness the innate immune system through therapeutic antibodies and its\nANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) proprietary platform.\nInnate’s portfolio includes lead proprietary program lacutamab, developed in advanced form of cutaneous\nT cell lymphomas and peripheral T cell lymphomas, monalizumab developed with AstraZeneca in non-\nsmall cell lung cancer, as well as ANKET® multi-specific NK cell engagers to address multiple tumor\ntypes. The Company has developed, internally and through its business development strategy, a broad and\ndiversified portfolio including seven clinical drug candidates and a robust preclinical pipeline. Innate has\n132\nentered into collaborations with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as AstraZeneca,Sanofi\nand Takeda. Innate Pharma believes its drug candidates and clinical development approach are\ndifferentiated from current immuno-oncology therapies and have the potential to significantly improve the\nclinical outcome for patients with cancer.\nSince its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources to research and\ndevelopment efforts, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates,\nproviding general and administrative support for its operations and protecting its intellectual property.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had €102.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and non-current financial assets. Since its inception, the Company has raised a total of €311.4\nmillion through the sale of equity securities, including €33.7 million in the initial public offering of its\nordinary shares on Euronext Paris in 2006 and €66.0 million in the initial public offering of our ordinary\nshares on Euronext and ADS on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, in 2019. As of December\n31, 2023, the Company has also received $635.4 million (€560.1 million) in payments from its\ncollaborators, including AstraZeneca, since 2011, excluding payments received for purchases of its equity\nsecurities by its collaborators.\nThe Company has significant agreements with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Takeda pursuant to which it has\nthe right to earn milestone and royalty payments. The Company has other license agreements, pursuant to\nwhich it has acquired intellectual property and under which the Company will be required to make\npayments to the counterparty upon the achievement of certain milestone events and commercial sales\nrelated to its product candidates.\nThe Company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception except for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2018. The Company net income (loss) was €(52.8) million, €(58.1) million and\n€(7.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of\nits net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with its research and development programs\nand from selling, general and administrative expenses associated with its operations. As the Company\ncontinues advancing its product candidates through research and development programs, the Company\nexpects to continue to incur significant expenses and may again incur operating losses in future periods.\nThe Company anticipates that such expenses will increase substantially if and as the Company:\n• continues the research and development of its product candidates;\n• initiates clinical trials for, or additional preclinical development of, its product candidates;\n• further develops and refines the manufacturing processes for its product candidates;\n• changes or adds manufacturers or suppliers of biological materials;\n• seeks regulatory and marketing authorizations for any of its product candidates that\nsuccessfully complete development;\n• seeks to identify and validate additional product candidates;\n• acquires or licenses other product candidates, technologies or biological materials;\n• makes milestone, royalty or other payments under any current or future license agreements;\n• obtains, maintains, protects and enforces its intellectual property portfolio;\n• secures manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;\n• seeks to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel;\n• creates additional infrastructure to support its operations as a U.S. public company and incurs\nincreased legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses; and\n133\n• experiences delays or encounters issues with any of the above.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional funding, prior to completing clinical\ndevelopment of any of its product candidates. Until such time that the Company can generate significant\nrevenues from sales of its product candidates, if approved, the Company expects to finance its operating\nactivities through a combination of milestone payments received pursuant to its strategic alliances, equity\nofferings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and collaborations, and licensing\narrangements. However, the Company may not receive milestone payments when expected, or at all, and\nthe Company may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on\nfavorable terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on its financial condition and could force\nthe Company to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its development programs or commercialization efforts\nor grant to others rights to develop or market product candidates that the Company would otherwise\nprefer to develop and market itself. Failure to receive additional funding could cause the Company to\ncease operations, in part or in full.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe Company audited consolidated financial statements included herein as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nDue to the listing of its ordinary shares on Euronext Paris and in accordance with the European Union’s\nregulation No. 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002, the Company also prepares and publishes its consolidated\nfinancial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU).\nAll the standards published by the IASB that are mandatorily applicable in the years ended December\n2021, 2022 and 2023 are endorsed by the EU and are mandatorily applicable in the EU. Therefore, the\nCompany audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and\n2023 are compliant with both IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the EU.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make\nsignificant judgments and estimates which are presented below. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and\nSignificant Judgments and Estimates.”\nPrincipal Collaboration and Licensing Agreements of the Company\nThe Company results of operations are impacted by the terms and conditions of its principal collaboration\nand licensing agreements. For a description of its principal collaboration and licensing agreements, see\n“Item 10C.—Material Contracts.”\nPrincipal Components of the Company Results of Operations\nRevenue and other income\nThe Company revenue and other income mainly consists of revenues from collaboration and licensing\nagreements and government financing for research expenditure in the form of research tax credits, as well\nas other grants.\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements\nThe Company currently derives substantially all its revenues from payments pursuant to its licensing and\ncollaboration agreements notably with AstraZeneca relating to monalizumab and IPH5201, Sanofi\nrelating to IPH6101/SAR'579, IPH6401/SAR'514 and IPH62 consisting of (i) upfront payments, (ii)\nmilestone payments based upon the achievement of pre-determined development, regulatory and\ncommercial events and (iii) research and development fees related to charges for full time equivalents, or\nFTEs, at contracted rates and reimbursement of research and development expenses.\n134\nThe Company has not generated any significant revenue from product sales since its inception, with the\nexception in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 of Lumoxiti sales, which were previously classified in its half-\nyear and annual reports in the net income (loss) from distribution agreements during the transition period\nwith AstraZeneca (ended September 30, 2020) and as revenue since the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs a result of Innate's decision to terminate the agreement entered into with AstraZeneca in October 2018\nand relating to the license of Lumoxiti (the \"Lumoxiti Agreement\") in December 2020, a termination and\ntransition agreement was negotiated and executed, effective as of June 30, 2021 terminating the Lumoxiti\nAgreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement, the quality\nagreement and other related agreements) and transferring the U.S. marketing authorization and\ndistribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca, or the Termination and Transition Agreement. Under\nthe Termination and Transition Agreement, Innate and AstraZeneca delivered a notice to the FDA\nrequesting that the U.S. marketing authorization be transferred back to AstraZeneca as from October 1,\n2021. AstraZeneca has reimbursed Innate for all Lumoxiti related costs, expenses and benefited net sales.\nAs of December 31, 2023, this transfer has now been completed.\nAs a consequence of the termination of the Lumoxiti Agreement, the Lumoxiti activity (including sales) is\npresented in the consolidated income statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements as a\ndiscontinued operation for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 financial years in accordance with IFRS5 \"non-\ncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\"\nThe Company ability to generate significant product revenue and to become profitable will depend upon\nits ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any product\ncandidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and\nregulatory approval, the Company is unable to predict the amount, timing or whether it will be able to\nobtain product revenue.\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\nThe Company's government financing for research expenditures consists of research tax credits (crédit\nd’impôt recherche) and grants.\nThe research tax credit is granted to companies by the French tax authorities in order to encourage them\nto conduct technical and scientific research. Companies demonstrating that they have expenses that meet\nthe required criteria, including research expenses located in France or, since January 1, 2005, within the\nEU or in another state that is a party to the agreement in the European Economic Area that has concluded\na tax treaty with France that contains an administrative assistance clause, receive a tax credit which can be\nused against the payment of the corporate tax due for the fiscal year in which the expenses were incurred\nand during the next three fiscal years, or, as applicable, can be reimbursed for the excess portion. The\nexpenditures taken into account for the calculation of the research tax credit involve only research\nexpenses.\nThe main characteristics of the research tax credit are:\n• the research tax credit results in a cash inflow to the Company, i.e., it is used to offset the\npayment of corporate income tax the year after the date of its record as a tax credit in the\nincome statement, or is paid directly to the Company from the tax authorities for the portion\nthat remains unused, in principle, three years after the fiscal year for which it is determined;\n• The Company's corporate income tax liability does not limit the amount of the research tax\ncredit. If the Company does not pay any corporate income tax, the Company can offset the\nremaining research tax credit the year following its record in the income statement; and\n135\n• the research tax credit is not included in the determination of the corporate income tax.\nWhen the research tax credit is not deductible from taxes payable by the Company, it is generally\nreimbursed by the French government three years after the fiscal year for which it is determined.\nHowever, since 2011, companies that meet the definition of small and medium sized enterprises\n(“SMEs”) according to the European Union criteria are eligible for early reimbursement of their research\ntax credit receivable. The status of SME is lost when the criteria for eligibility are exceeded during two\nconsecutive years. The Company lost its SME status at the end of the 2019 fiscal year but has been\neligible again since the end of the 2021 financial year. As of December 31, 2023, the company lost again\nthe SME status due to two consecutive year with a statutory turnover over €50 000 thousands.\nThe Company has concluded that the research tax credit meets the definition of a government grant as\ndefined in IAS 20 Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance (IAS 20),\nand that the classification as “Revenue and other income” in its consolidated statement of income (loss) is\nappropriate.\nInnate also from time to time receives government grants, which are recognized in its consolidated\nstatement of income (loss) when comply with the conditions attached to the grants and they are non-\nrepayable grants.\nOperating expenses from continuing operations\nSince its inception, Innate's operating expenses have consisted primarily of research and development\nexpenses and general and administration expenses.\nFollowing the transfer back of the U.S. marketing authorization to AstraZeneca linked to the Termination\nand Transition Agreement (from October 1, 2021), selling expenses relating to Lumoxiti activities are\npresented as discontinued operations since December 31, 2021. The 2020 and 2019 comparatives have\nbeen restated compared to previous publications, in accordance with the same standard (see\n\"Discontinued Operations\" below).\nResearch and development expenses\nThe Company engages in substantial research and development efforts to develop innovative product\ncandidates. Research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n• personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and share-based compensation, for Innate's\nemployees engaged in scientific research and development functions;\n• cost of third-party contractors and academic institutions involved in preclinical studies or\nclinical trials that the Company may conduct, or third-party contractors involved in field trials;\n• purchases of biological raw materials, real estate leasing costs as well as conferences and\ntravel costs; and\n• certain other expenses, such as expenses for use of laboratories and facilities for Innate's\nresearch and development activities as well as depreciation and amortization.\nInnate's research and development efforts are focused on its existing product candidates and preclinical\nprograms, including the advancement of its lead product candidates, monalizumab, lacutamab. Its direct\nresearch and development expenses consist principally of external costs associated with subcontracting of\npreclinical and clinical operations to third parties, which Innate tracks on a program-by-program basis.\nThe Company also uses its employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and\ndevelopment programs, and does not track these indirect expenses on a program-by-program basis.\n136\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized\nbased on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as information\nprovided to Innate Pharma by its vendors and analyzing the progress of its preclinical studies or other\nservices performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense\nbalances at the end of any reporting period. Non-refundable advance payments for research and\ndevelopment goods or services to be received in the future from third parties are deferred and capitalized.\nThe capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nResearch and development activities are central to Innate's business. As product candidates in later stages\nof clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical\ndevelopment, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, the Company\nexpects that its research and development costs will increase in the foreseeable future. Such cost increases\nare expected to occur as the Company conducts existing clinical trials and initiates future clinical trials,\nmanufactures pre-commercial clinical trial and preclinical study materials, expands its research and\ndevelopment efforts, seeks regulatory approvals for its product candidates that successfully complete\nclinical trials, accesses and develops additional technologies and hires additional personnel to support its\nresearch and development efforts.\nThe Company cannot determine with certainty the duration and total costs of its future clinical trials of its\nproduct candidates or if, when, or to what extent it will generate revenues from the commercialization and\nsale of any of its product candidates, or those of its collaborators, that might obtain regulatory approval.\nThe Company may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any product candidates. The\nduration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of its product candidates will depend on a\nvariety of factors, including:\n• the scope, rate of progress and expense of its ongoing clinical trials as well as any additional\npreclinical studies, clinical trials conducted by its collaborators and other research and\ndevelopment activities;\n• clinical trial and preclinical study results;\n• the terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\n• the expense of filing, maintaining, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and\nother intellectual property rights; and\n• the ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any products that\nreceive regulatory approval.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of monalizumab,\nlacutamab or any other product candidate or preclinical program that the Company is developing or could\ndevelop in the future could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the\ndevelopment of such product candidates or preclinical programs. For example, if the FDA, the EMA or\nanother regulatory authority were to require Innate to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials beyond\nthose that it currently anticipates will be required for the completion of clinical development, or if the\nCompany experiences significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, the Company could be\nrequired to spend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical\ndevelopment. For a discussion of the risks associated with completing the development projects on\nschedule, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Development of the Product Candidates.”\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and share-based compensation\nfor personnel other than research and development staff. Selling, general and administrative expenses also\n137\nconsist of fees for professional services, mainly related to audit, IT, accounting, recruitment and legal\nservices, communication and travel costs, real-estate leasing costs, office furniture and equipment costs,\nallowance for amortization and depreciation, director’s attendance fees and insurance costs and overhead\ncosts, such as postal and telecommunications expenses.\nNet financial income (loss)\nThe financial income (loss) primarily consists of realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and\nlosses primarily related to the purchase of services as well as deposit accounts denominated in U.S.\ndollars and gains and losses and interest received in relation to cash and cash equivalents that have been\ndeposited in cash accounts, short-term fixed deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with\noriginal maturities of three months or less. Thus, the Company's cash and cash equivalents generated €1.9\nmillion of interest income in the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Innate expects to continue this\ninvestment philosophy in the future.\nNet result from discontinued operations\nPursuant to the Termination and Transition Agreement, in the year ended December 31, 2020 results\nannouncement, the Company reported a contingent liability of up to $12.8 million in its consolidated\nfinancial statements, which was related to the splitting of certain manufacturing costs. As part of the\nTermination and Transition Agreement, Innate and AstraZeneca agreed to split these manufacturing costs,\nand Innate paid $6.2 million (€5.5 million as of December 31, 2021) to AstraZeneca on April 30, 2022.\nAs a consequence of the termination of the Lumoxiti Agreement, the Lumoxiti activity (including sales) is\npresented in the consolidated income statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements as a\ndiscontinued operation for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 financial years in accordance with IFRS5 \"non-\ncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\" Therefore, the income statement for the years\nended December 31, 2020 and subsequent years have been prepared with the Lumoxiti activity (including\nsales) as a discontinued operation for the 2020 and subsequent financial years in accordance with the\nsame IFRS standard.\nImpairment of intangible assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is an indication that intangible\nassets, property and equipment may be impaired. If any indication exists, the Group estimates the\nrecoverable amount of the related asset.\nWhether or not there is any indication of impairment, intangible assets not yet available for use are tested\nfor impairment annually by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.\nPursuant to IAS 36—Impairment of Assets, criteria for assessing indication of loss in value may notably\ninclude performance levels lower than forecast, a significant change in market data or the regulatory\nenvironment, or obsolescence or physical damage of the asset not included in the amortization/\ndepreciation schedule. The recognition of an impairment loss alters the amortizable/depreciable amount\nand potentially, the amortization/depreciation schedule of the relevant asset.\nAs of December 31, 2022, impairment of intangible assets consisted of the full depreciation of\navdoralimab rights for an amount of €41.0 million, following the Company's decision to stop avdoralimab\ndevelopment in bullous phemphigoid (\"BP\") indication in inflammation following a decision taken by a\nsponsor to stop the Phase 2 clinical trial in said indication during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n138\nA. Operating Results\nComparisons for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023\nThe operating result is not impacted by hyperinflation on the Company's business.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's consolidated statements of income (loss) for\nthe periods presented.\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements\n€ 49,580 € 51,901\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\n8,035 9,729\nOther income\n59 11\nRevenue and other income\n57,674 61,641\nResearch and development expenses\n(51,663) (56,022)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(22,436) (18,288)\nImpairment of intangible assets (41,000) —\nOperating expenses\n(115,099) (74,310)\nOperating income (loss) (57,425) (12,669)\nFinancial income\n4,775 6,934\nFinancial expenses\n(5,321) (1,835)\nNet financial income (loss)\n(546) 5,099\nNet income (loss) before tax\n(57,972) (7,570)\nIncome tax expense\n— —\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations (57,972) (7,570)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations (131) —\nNet income (loss)\n€ (58,103) € (7,570)\nRevenue and other income\nRevenue and other income from continuing operations resulted from collaboration and licensing\nagreements and government financing for research expenditure. Revenue and other income from\n139\ncontinuing operations increased by €4.0 million, to €61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nas compared to revenue and other income of €57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements\n€ 49,580 € 51,901\nGovernment financing for research expenditures 8,035 9,729\nOther income\n59 11\nRevenue and other income\n€ 57,674 € 61,641\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements from continuing operations increased by €2.3\nmillion, to €51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to revenue from\ncollaboration and licensing agreements of €49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly resulted from the partial or entire\nrecognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca signed in April 2015\nand October 2018, as well as the agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 and 2022 and also with Takeda in\n2023. Proceeds are recognized on the basis of the percentage of completion of the works performed by the\nCompany under such agreements.\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements is set forth in the table below.\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nProceeds from collaboration and licensing agreements\nof which monalizumab agreement - AstraZeneca\n22,376 € 9,499\nof which IPH5201 agreement - AstraZeneca\n4,677 —\nof which preclinical molecules agreement - AstraZeneca\n17,400 —\nof which Sanofi agreement 2016\n4,000 2,000\nof which Sanofi agreement 2022 - ANKET IPH62 - Recognition of license initial — 18,873\nof which Sanofi agreement 2022 - ANKET IPH67 -Recognition of license initial — 15,800\nof which Takeda agreement 2023 — 4,553\nof which other agreements 353 —\nProceeds from collaboration and licensing agreements\n48,806 50,725\nInvoicing of research and development costs (IPH5201)\n1,391 1,165\nExchange gains (loss) on collaboration agreements\n(627) —\nOthers\n10 11\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements\n€ 49,580 € 51,901\n140\nProceeds related to monalizumab.\nRevenues related to monalizumab result from the partial recognition of the $250.0 million non-refundable\nupfront payment and the $100.0 million milestone resulting from the exercise of the option received in\nJune 2015 and October 2018 from AstraZeneca. The additional payment of $50.0 million (€47.7 million)\nreceived from AstraZeneca in December 2020 triggered by the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3\ntrial evaluating monalizumab was treated in full as a collaboration commitment (\"collaboration liability\"\nin the consolidated balance sheet) in view to the commitment linked to the agreement for the Phase 1/2\n(co-financing) and Phase 3 studies (amendment signed in September 2020). For more information, see\nNote 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements are included as part of this Annual Report.\nConsequently, this additional payment has no impact on the transaction price.\nIn addition to these amounts, AstraZeneca made an additional payment of $50.0 million (€47.7 million) in\nJune 2022, triggered by the treatment of the first patient in a second Phase 3 trial evaluating monalizumab\nin April 2022. This additional payment has been treated as a collaboration commitment (\"collaboration\nliability\" in the consolidated balance sheet) for an amount of $36.0 million (€34.3 million) in view to the\ncontractual commitment linked to the Phase 1/2 studies (co-funding under the initial contract). The\nremaining $14.0 million was treated as a change in estimate of the transaction price, recognized in the\nincome statement in line with the progress of the Phase 1/2 studies.\nRevenue related to monalizumab decreased by €12.9 million, to €9.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2023, as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This €12.9 million\ndecrease mainly resulted from to the increase, in the first half of 2022, in the transaction price of €13.4\nmillion ($14.0 million) triggered by the launch of the PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trial on April 28, 2022. As a\nreminder, this increase in the transaction price led to the recognition of additional income of €12.6 million\nin the income related to the monalizumab agreement for 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the amount not\nrecognized as revenue amounted to €5.2 million, and is presented in full under \"Current contract\nliabilities\" given the maturity of the Phase 1/2 trials.\nProceeds related to IPH5201. Revenue related to IPH5201 for the year ended December 31, 2023 is $0.0\ncompared with $5.0 million (€4.7 million) for the year 2022. This revenue related to the milestone\npayment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1, 2022 of an amendment to the\ninitial contract signed in October 2018. This amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following\nAstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company will conduct the study.\nBoth parties will share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and\nAstraZeneca will provide products necessary to conduct the clinical trial. For more information on this\namendment, see Note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements are included as part of this Annual\nReport.\nProceeds related to collaboration and option agreement related to four to-be-agreed upon molecules\n(preclinical molecules).\nDuring the first half of 2022, the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its\noption to license the four preclinical programs covered in the \"Future Programs Option Agreement.\" This\nlicense option was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under\nwhich the Company had received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4 million). As the rights\nrelated to these four preclinical programs have been returned to the Company, the entire upfront payment\nof $20.0 million (€17.4 million) has been recognized as revenue as of June 30, 2022.\n141\nInvoicing of research and development costs - IPH5201.\nPursuant to the Company's agreements with AstraZeneca, research and development costs related to\nIPH5201 in connection with preclinical work are fully borne by AstraZeneca, in accordance with the\ninitial 2018 agreement. These costs were re-invoiced on a quarterly basis. Following the signature on June\n1, 2022 of an amendment to the initial agreement signed in October 2018 specifying the terms of the\ncollaboration following the decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study, the parties are committed to\nsharing the external costs of the study incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca will provide products\nnecessary to conduct the clinical trial.\nRevenue from invoicing of research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 was\n€1.2 million compared to €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or a decrease of € 0.2\nmillion.\nProceeds related to Sanofi 2016 agreement.\nRevenues under the collaboration and license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 amounted to €2.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to €4.0 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The Company announced that, in June 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored\nPhase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As\nprovided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016, Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million,\nfully recognized in revenue since June 2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21,\n2023. As a reminder, the revenue recognized in 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/\nSAR'514 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug. This decision triggered a\nmilestone payment of €3.0 million fully recognized in revenue. This amount was received by the\nCompany on September 9, 2022.\nProceeds related to Sanofi 2022 agreement\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a research collaboration and\nlicense agreement with Genzyme Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi (“Sanofi”) pursuant\nto which the Company granted Sanofi an exclusive license on the Innate Pharma's B7-H3 ANKET®\nprogram and options on two additional targets. On January 25, 2023, the Company announced the\nexpiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976\nand the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24, 2023. Consequently, the Company\nreceived an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023, including €18.5 million relating to the\nexclusive license, €1.5 million relating to the research work and €5.0 million relating to the two additional\ntargets options.\nThe Company considers that the license to the B7-H3 technology is a right to use the intellectual property\ngranted exclusively to Sanofi as from the effective date of the agreement. As such, the €18.5 million\nupfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue since June 2023.\nThe Company will provide collaborative research services to Sanofi for an initial estimated three years\nperiod as from the effective date of the collaboration, i.e., January 24, 2023. During this period, Sanofi\nand Innate will collaborate and work on research activities as defined in the work program described in\nthe agreement. Consequently, the corresponding upfront payment of €1.5 million will be recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the duration of the research services that the Company has agreed to carry out. As\na result, a €0.4 million has been recognized in revenue as of December 31, 2023, and amounts not\nrecognized in revenue are classified as deferred revenue—current portion equal to €0.3 million and\ndeferred revenue—non-current portion equal to €0.8 million.\nUnder the terms of this agreement, the Company has also granted two exclusive options, exercisable no\nlater than three years after the effective date, for exclusive licenses to Innate's intellectual property for the\n142\nresearch, development, manufacture and commercialization of NKCEs specifically targeting two\npreclinical molecules. The Company considers that the option to acquire an exclusive license provide a\nmaterial right to Sanofi that it would not receive without entering into this agreement. The Company will\nrecognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date.\nConsequently, the €5.0 million initial payment relating to these options was recognized in deferred\nrevenue—non-current portion as of June 30, 2023.\nOn December 19, 2023, the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised an option for one of the two\npreclinical molecules. As a consequence, the Company recognized related income of €2.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThis option exercise also resulted in a milestone payment of €15.0 million, including €13.3 million in\nrespect of the exclusive license, which was fully recognized in income as of December 31, 2023, and\n€1.7 million in respect of research services to be carried out by the Company. Sanofi and Innate will\ncollaborate and work on the research activities defined in the contractual work program. Consequently,\nthe corresponding initial payment of €1.7 million will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nduration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. This work had not yet begun as\nof December 31, 2023. In this respect, no revenue has been recognized in the income statement, and the\namount of €1.7 million is presented under current contract liabilities (€0.4 million) and non-current\ncontract liabilities (€1.3 million).\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sanofi still retains a license option for a third preclinical molecule.\nProceeds related to Takeda agreement\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with\nTakeda under which Innate granted Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop ADCs\nusing a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a primary focus in Celiac\ndisease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and commercialization of\nany potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such, the Company considers that the\nlicense granted is a right to use the relevant intellectual property, which is granted fully and perpetually to\nTakeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual\nproperty granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently, the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial\npayment, received by the Company in May 2023, was fully recognized in revenue since June 30, 2023.\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\nGovernment funding for research expenditures increased by €1.7 million, or 21.08%, to €9.7 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs a reminder, the 2022 research tax credit included a reduction of €1.3 million related to a provision\nfollowing the tax inspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities. This provision was based\non estimated amounts and adjustments not disputed by the Company and has been increased in 2023 for\n€0.1 million.\nThe table below details government funding for research expenditures for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2023.\n143\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\nResearch Tax Credit(1)\n€ 7,925 € 9,729\nGrant and other tax credit(2)\n110 —\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\n€ 8,035 € 9,729\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, the amount is mainly composed of (i) the research tax credit calculated and recognized for the 2023 financial\nyear for an amount of €9.8 million compared to €9.2 million for the 2022 financial year which is subtracted (ii) a provision amounting to\n€0.1 million following the tax inspection compared to €1.3 million last year. As a reminder, the tax inspection carried out by the French\ntax authorities related to the 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax credit calculation and 2019 and 2020 income tax calculation as the prescription\nperiod are different. On February 13, 2024, the Company received from the tax authorities the rectification proposal and adjusted the\nprovision to €0.1 million following the final settlement.\n(2) The company can be eligible to local or European grants dedicated to R&D program.\nThe research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses, net of\ngrants received, eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year.\nOperating expenses\nThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development expenses\n(51,663) (56,022)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(22,436) (18,288)\nImpairment of intangible assets (41,000) —\nTotal operating expenses after impairment\n€ (115,099) € (74,310)\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development expenses are broken down as set forth in the table below for the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\n144\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nLacutamab € (12,473) € (12,248)\nMonalizumab\n(1,224) (791)\nAvdoralimab (385) (175)\nIPH5201 (1,648) (2,313)\nIPH5301 (625) (296)\nSub-total programs in clinical development (16,355) (15,823)\nSub-total programs in preclinical development (11,129) (14,356)\nTotal direct research and development expenses (27,484) (30,179)\nPersonnel expenses (including share-based payments) (16,373) (17,121)\nDepreciation and amortization (2,928) (3,891)\nOther expenses (4,877) (4,831)\nPersonnel and other expenses (24,178) (25,843)\nTotal research and development expenses (1) € (51,663) € (56,022)\n(1) 2022 Total Research and Development expenses excludes €41.0 million of avdoralimab impairment.\nResearch and development expenses from continuing operations increased by €4.4 million, or 8.4%, to\n€56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to research and development expenses\nof €51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase over the period is mainly due to an\nincrease in direct research and development expenses of €2.7 million over the period due to the\nsignificant increase in expenses relating to pre-clinical development programs, partly offset by the\ndecrease in expenses relating to clinical programs. Research and development expenses represented a\ntotal of 75.4% and 69.7% of operating expenses before impairment for years ended December 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. Indirect expenses increased by €1.7 million mainly in personnel\nexpenses and amortization and depreciation.\nDirect research and development expenses increased by €2.7 million, or 9.8%, to €30.2 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, as compared to direct research and development expenses of €27.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is mainly due to a €3.2 million increase in\nexpenses related to preclinical development programs relating notably to the ADC field, partly offset by a\n€0.5 million decrease in expenses related to the Company's clinical programs. This decrease in clinical\nprograms expenses mainly results from a €0.4 million decrease in expenses relating to the monalizumab\nprogram, a €0.2 million decrease in expenses relating to the avdoralimab program and a €0.2 million\ndecrease in expenses relating to the lacutamab program, partly offset by a €0.7 million increase in\nexpenses related to the growth in IPH5201 phase 2 trials patient recruitment.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2023, the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements\nsigned with AstraZeneca in April 2015, October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €52.7 million, as\ncompared to collaborations liabilities of €63.2 million as of December 31, 2022. This decrease of €10.5\nmillion mainly results from (i) net repayment of €8.4 million during year 2023 to AstraZeneca linked to\nthe Monalizumab cofinancing program, including phase 3 trial INTERLINK-1 launched in October 2020\nand PACIFIC-9 launched in April 2022, and (ii) the decrease of the collaboration commitment\n145\n(\"collaboration liabilities\" in the consolidated statements of financial position) for an amount of €2.0\nmillion linked to the Euro-dollar parity exchange rate variation.\nPersonnel and other expenses allocated to research and development increased by €1.7 million, or 6.9%,\nto €25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €24.2 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is due to the (i) €0.7 million increase in staff costs\nallocated to research and development, of which €0.5 million in personnel expenses and €0.2 million in\nshare-based payment expenses, (ii) increase of €1.0 million in depreciation and amortization. The line\nitem is mainly composed of the amortization of the monalizumab, IPH5201 intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 140 employees, including Leadership Team members, in\nresearch and development functions, compared to 155 as of December 31, 2022.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by €4.1 million, or 18.5%, to\n€18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses represented a total of 24.6% and 30.3% of our\ntotal operating expenses before impairment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe table below presents our general and administrative expenses by nature for the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2023:\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nPersonnel expenses (including share based payments)\n€ (10,229) € (8,842)\nNon scientific advisory and consulting\n(4,244) (2,906)\nOther expenses (1)\n(7,963) (6,540)\nTotal general and administrative\n€ (22,436) € (18,288)\n.\n(1) Other expenses are related to intellectual property, maintenance costs for laboratory equipment and our headquarters, depreciation and\namortization and other general and administrative expenses.\nPersonnel expenses, which includes the compensation paid to our employees and consultants, decreased\nby €1.4 million, or 13.6%, to €8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to\npersonnel expenses of €10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease mainly results\nfrom a decrease in wages of €1.2 million as well as a decrease of €0.2 million in share-based payment\nexpenses mainly explained by the decrease of employees. As of December 31, 2023, we had\n39 employees, including Leadership Team members, in general and administrative functions, as\ncompared to 55 as of December 31, 2022.\nNon-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing, accounting, legal and hiring\nservices. These expenses decreased by €1.3 million, or 31.5%, to €2.9 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThis decrease mainly results from operating efficiency measures, which led to a reduction in the number\nof new hires, and use of external communication and consulting services.\n146\nOther general and administrative expenses relate to intellectual property, depreciation and amortization\nand other general, administrative expenses. These expenses decreased by €1.4 million or 17.9% to €6.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €8.0 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nThis decrease related notably to savings (reduction in office space) and a reclassification of R&D\nlaboratory support costs (maintenance, supplies, depreciation of R&D equipment) for 1.0 million euros in\nR&D.\nImpairment of intangible assets\nAs a reminder, for the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment of intangible assets results from full\nimpairment of anti-C5aR rights acquired from Novo/Nordisk A/S (avdoralimab intangible asset) for an\namount of €41.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company was informed by the sponsor of\nthe Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating avdoralimab in inflammation in bullous pemphigoid (\"BP\") indication\nof its decision to stop said trial. Consequently, the Company decided in December 2022 to stop the\ndevelopment of avdoralimab in BP indication in inflammation, only indication supporting the recoverable\namount of the asset as of December 31, 2021 (as well that as of June 30, 2022).

The remaining amount of $14.0 million (€13.4 million) has\n151\nbeen treated as an increase of the transaction price, recognized in the income statement in line with the\nprogress of the Phase 1/2 studies. This increase in the transaction price generated a €12.6 million\nfavorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements over the period. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounted to €14.5 million (€6.6\nmillion as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” and €7.9 million as “Deferred revenue—Non-current\nportion”).\nProceeds related to IPH5201. Revenue related to IPH5201 for the year ended December 31, 2022 is €4.7\nmillion and results from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million (€4.7 million) milestone\npayment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1, 2022 of an amendment to the\ninitial contract signed in October 2018. This amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following\nAstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company will conduct the study.\nBoth parties will share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and\nAstraZeneca will provide products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.\nProceeds related to collaboration and option agreement related to four to-be-agreed upon molecules\n(preclinical molecules). During the first half of 2022, the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice\nthat it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the \"Future Programs\nOption Agreement.\" This license option was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca\nand the Company under which the Company had received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4\nmillion). As the rights related to these four preclinical programs have been returned to the Company, the\nentire upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4 million) has been recognized as revenue as of June 30,\n2022.\nInvoicing of research and development costs - IPH5201. Pursuant to the Company's agreements with\nAstraZeneca, research and development costs related to IPH5201 in connection with preclinical work are\nfully borne by AstraZeneca, in accordance with the initial 2018 agreement. These costs were re-invoiced\non a quarterly basis. Following the signature on June 1, 2022 of an amendment to the initial agreement\nsigned in October 2018 specifying the terms of the collaboration following the decision to advance\nIPH5201 to a Phase 2 study, the parties are committed to sharing the external costs of the study incurred\nby the Company and AstraZeneca will provide products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.\nRevenue from invoicing of research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 was\n€1.4 million compared to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or a decrease of € 0.2\nmillion.\nProceeds related to Sanofi 2016 agreement. Revenues under the collaboration and license agreement\nsigned with Sanofi in 2016 amounted to €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared\nto €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the period, the Company announced,\nnotably, the decision taken by Sanofi to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 towards regulatory preclinical studies\nfor a new investigational drug. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €3.0 million fully\nrecognized in revenue. This amount was received by the Company on September 9, 2022.\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\nGovernment funding for research expenditures decreased by €4.6 million, or 36.2%, to €8.0 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThis change is mainly due to a €2.4 million decrease in the research tax credit which is mainly due to (i) a\ndecrease in eligible expenses in the research tax credit calculation and (ii) a provision following the tax\ninspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities and recognized as a deduction from the 2022\nresearch tax credit. This provision is based on estimated amounts and adjustments not disputed by the\n152\nCompany.The table below details government funding for research expenditures for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022.\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nResearch Tax Credit(1)\n€ 10,310 € 7,925\nGrant and other tax credit(2)\n€ 2,281 € 110\nGovernment financing for research expenditures\n€ 12,591 € 8,035\n(1) As of December 31, 2022, the amount is mainly composed of (i) the research tax credit calculated and recognized for the 2022 financial\nyear for an amount of €9.2 million from which is subtracted (ii) a provision amounting to €1.3 million following the tax inspection carried\nout in 2022 by the French tax authorities and relating to the 2019 and 2020 financial years as well as to the research tax credit and the\naccuracy of its calculation for the 2018 to 2018 financial years 2020. This provision was recognized as a deduction from the 2022 research\ntax credit, based on estimated amounts and adjustments not disputed by the Company. On March 3, 2023, the Company received from the\ntax authorities the rectification proposal, confirming the amount of the provision recognized on the amounts of the rectifications not\ndisputed by the Company.\n(2) As a reminder, the total amount of grants recognized in the income statement as of December 31, 2021 included an amount of €2.0 million\nrepresenting the first tranche received (€1.4 million) and a remaining amount to be received (€0.6 million) related to the BPI financing\ncontract signed in August 2020 as a part of the program set up by the French government to help develop a therapeutic solution with a\npreventive or curative aim against COVID-19. As of December 31, 2021, the financing is considered by the Company to be non-\nrefundable, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in light of the technical and commercial failure of the project based on the\nresults of the Phase 2 \"Force\" trial evaluating avdoralimab in COVID-19, published in July 6, 2021. The remaining amount of €0.6 million\nhas been received by Company in January and May, 2022.\nThe research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses, net of\ngrants received, eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year.\nOperating expenses\nThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development\n€ (47,004) € (51,663)\nSelling, general and administrative\n(25,524) (22,436)\nTotal operating expenses\n€ (72,528) € (115,099)\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development expenses from continuing operations are broken down as set forth in the\ntable below for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\n153\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nLacutamab € (14,834) € (12,473)\nMonalizumab (1,913) (1,224)\nAvdoralimab (3,330) (385)\nIPH5201 (558) (1,648)\nIPH5301 — (625)\nSub-total programs in clinical development (20,635) (16,355)\nSub-total programs in preclinical development (6,089) (11,129)\nTotal direct research and development expenses (26,724) (27,484)\nPersonnel expenses (including share-based payments) (15,208) (16,373)\nDepreciation and amortization (3,153) (2,928)\nOther expenses (1,918) (4,877)\nPersonnel and other expenses (20,279) (24,178)\nTotal research and development expenses € (47,004) € (51,663)\nResearch and development expenses from continuing operations increased by €4.7 million, or 9.9%, to\n€51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to research and development of €47.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase over the period is mainly due to an increase\nin indirect research and development expenses resulting from an increase of €3.9 million in personnel and\nother expenses in line with (i) an increase in scientific and non scientific fees related to research and\ndevelopment operations. In addition, direct research and development expenses increased by €0.8 million\nover the period due to the significant increase in expenses relating to non-clinical development programs,\npartly offset by the decrease in expenses relating to clinical programs. Research and development\nexpenses represented a total of 69.7% and 64.8% of operating expenses before impairment for years\nended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nDirect research and development expenses increased by €0.8 million, or 2.8%, to €27.5 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, as compared to direct research and development expenses of €26.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a €5.0 million increase\nin expenses related to preclinical development programs relating notably to IPH6501, partly offset by a\n€4.3 million decrease in expenses related to the Company's clinical programs. This decrease in clinical\nprograms expenses mainly results from a €2.9 million and decrease in expenses relating to the\navdoralimab program and a €2.4 million decrease in expenses relating to the lacutamab program, partly\noffset by a €1.1 million increase in expenses related to IPH5201.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2022, the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements\nsigned with AstraZeneca in April 2015, October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €63.2 million, as\ncompared to collaborations liabilities of €40.4 million as of December 31, 2021. This increase of €22.8\nmillion mainly results from the additional payment of $50.0 million (€47.7 million) made by AstraZeneca\nin June 2022 and triggered by the treatment of the first patient in a second Phase 3 trial “PACIFIC-9”\nevaluating monalizumab in April 2022. This additional payment has been treated as an increase of the\ncollaboration commitment (\"collaboration liabilities\" in the consolidated statements of financial position)\nfor an amount of $36.0 million (€34.3 million) in connection to the Phase 3 study co-funding commitment\nmade by the Company and notified to AstraZeneca in July 2019. This increase was partially offset by\n154\npayments made in 2022 to AstraZeneca related to the co-funding of the monalizumab program, including\nthe Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9 trials.\nPersonnel and other expenses allocated to research and development increased by €3.9 million, or 19.2%,\nto €24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to an amount of €20.3 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is due to (i) a €3.0 million increase in other expenses\nrelated to the €1.3 million increase in non-scientific fees and the €1.0 million increase in scientific fees\nallocated to research and development, mainly explained by the increase in the use of external medical\nand regulatory experts, as well as (ii) the €1.2 million increase in staff costs allocated to research and\ndevelopment. This increase is mainly explained by the increase of €1.7 million share-based payments\nexpenses.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had 152 employees in research and development functions,\ncompared to 148 as of December 31, 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by €3.1 million, or 12.1%, to\n€22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to €25.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses represented a total of 30.3% and 35.2% of our\ntotal operating expenses before impairment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nThe table below presents our selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing activities by\nnature for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022:\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nPersonnel expenses (including share based payments)\n€ (10,883) € (10,229)\nNon scientific advisory and consulting\n(5,108) (4,244)\nOther expenses (1)\n(9,533) (7,963)\nTotal general and administrative\n€ (25,524) € (22,436)\n(1) Other expenses are related to intellectual property, maintenance costs for laboratory equipment and our headquarters, depreciation and\namortization and other general and administrative expenses.\nPersonnel expenses, which includes the compensation paid to our employees and consultants, decreased\nby €0.7 million, or 6.0%, to €10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to\npersonnel expenses of €10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease mainly results\nfrom a decrease in wages of €0.6 million, mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual\nbonuses level in 2021 as compared to 2022. This decrease is completed by the decrease in share-based\npayments of €0.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had 59 employees in general and administrative\nfunctions, as compared to 65 as of December 31, 2021.\nNon-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing, accounting, legal and hiring\nservices. These expenses decreased by €0.9 million, or 16.9%, to €4.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to an amount of €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n155\nThis decrease results mainly from (i) an increase of €0.9 million in fees for strategic consulting and\nimplementation of the \"At-the-Market\" capital increase program, offset by (ii) a decrease of legal\nassistance costs, support costs by external service providers in the context of compliance with the\nSarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and costs relating to our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Innate Pharma Inc.\nOther general and administrative expenses relate to intellectual property, the costs of maintaining\nlaboratory equipment and our premises, depreciation and amortization and other general, administrative\nexpenses. These expenses increased by €1.6 million or 16.5% to €8.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to an amount of €9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThis decrease related notably to the reversals of provisions for charges in connection with restructuring\ncosts linked to the abandonment of the Company's commercial activities, as well as reversals of tax\nprovisions, both with the 2021 financial year. These elements are completed by a net position of more\nfavorable commercial exchange gains over the 2022 financial year.\nImpairment of intangible assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment of intangible assets results from full impairment of\nanti-C5aR rights acquired from Novo/Nordisk A/S (avdoralimab intangible asset) for an amount of €41.0\nmillion. During 2022 fourth quarter, the Company was informed by the sponsor of the Phase 2 clinical\ntrial evaluating avdoralimab in inflammation in BP indication of its decision to stop said trial.\nConsequently, the Company decided in December 2022 to stop the development of avdoralimab in BP\nindication in inflammation, only indication supporting the recoverable amount of the asset as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (as well that as of June 30, 2022).\nFinancial income (loss), net\nNet financial result decreased by €2.9 million, to a €0.5 million loss for the year ended December 31,\n2022, as compared to a €2.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2021. This change results\nmainly from the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (net loss of €1.6 million in 2022\nas compared to a €1.1 million gain in 2021) and a net foreign exchange gain of €0.8 million in 2022 as\ncompared to a net foreign exchange gain of €1.2 million in 2021.\nThe table below presents the components of our net financial result for the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2022:\n156\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nInterests and gains on financial assets\n€ 327 € 546\nUnrealized gains on financials assets\n1,177 418\nForeign exchange gains\n4,839 3,810\nOther financial income\n— —\nFinancial income\n6,344 4,775\nForeign exchange losses\n(3,591) (2,983)\nUnrealized losses on financial assets\n(95) (2,050)\nInterest on financial liabilities\n(312) (288)\nOther financial expenses\n— —\nFinancial expenses\n(3,997) (5,321)\nNet financial income (loss)\n€ 2,347 € (546)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, the foreign exchange gains and losses mainly result\nfrom the variance of the exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar on U.S. dollar-denominated\ncash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financial assets. Unrealized gains and losses on\nfinancial assets relate to unquoted instruments.\nNet result from discontinued operations\nSubsequently to the Termination and Transition Agreement, operations related to Lumoxiti are presented\nas a discontinued operation as of October 1, 2021.\nAs a consequence, the Lumoxiti activity (including sales) is presented in the consolidated income\nstatement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation for the 2021\nfinancial year in accordance with IFRS5 \"non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\"\nAs a consequence, net result from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti represents a net loss of\n€7.3 million as compared to a net loss €0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022,\nrespectively, presented as follows:\n157\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\nRevenue and other income (in thousands)\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing agreements 926 € 194\nSales 874 22\nTotal revenue and other income 1,800 216\nResearch and development expenses (1)\n(624) —\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (2)\n(8,507) (346)\nTotal operating expenses\n(9,131) (346)\nNet income (loss) from distribution agreements — —\nImpairment of intangible assets — —\nOperating income (loss) (7,331) (131)\nFinancial income — —\nFinancial expenses — —\nNet financial income (loss)\n— —\nNet income (loss) before tax\n(7,331) (131)\nIncome tax expense\n— —\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations (7,331) (131)\n(1) Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses relating to Lumoxiti discontinued operations amounted to €0.6\nmillion and nil for the years ended December 31, December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n(2) Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses relating to Lumoxiti discontinued operations\namounted to €8.5 million and €0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended the\nDecember 31, 2021, these expenses mainly consisted of the amount of $6.2 million (€5.5 million) to be paid on April 30, 2022 to\nAstraZeneca under the Termination and Transition Agreement.That amount was paid in 2022 by the Company in April 2022 for €5.9\nmillion ($6.2 million).\n158\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Some of the\naccounting methods and policies used in preparing the financial statements under IFRS are based on\ncomplex and subjective assessments by our management or on estimates based on past experience and\nassumptions deemed realistic and reasonable based on the facts and circumstances. The actual value of\nthe Company's assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as well as its income and expenses, could differ\nfrom the value derived from these estimates if conditions changed and these changes had an impact on the\nassumptions adopted. See Note 2 to the Company's consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere\nin this Annual Report.\nThe Company believes that the most significant management judgments and assumptions in the\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements are described below.\nAccounting for collaboration and licensing arrangements\nTo date, the Company's revenue has been generated primarily from payments received in relation to\nresearch, collaboration and licensing agreements signed with pharmaceutical companies. These contracts\ngenerally provide for components such as upfront payments, milestone payments upon reaching certain\npredetermined development objectives, research and development funding, as well as payment of\nroyalties on future sales of products.\nNon-refundable upfront payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period Innate is\nengaged to deliver services to the third party. Revenue is recognized based on completion of the\nunderlying work.\nMilestone payments represent amounts received from Innate's collaborators, the receipt of which is\ndependent upon the achievement of certain scientific, regulatory, or commercial milestones. The\nCompany recognizes milestone payments when the triggering event has occurred, there are no further\ncontingencies or services to be provided with respect to that event, and the counterparty has no right to a\nrefund of the payment. The triggering event may be scientific results achieved by the Company or another\nparty to the arrangement, regulatory approvals, or the marketing of products developed under the\narrangement. As of December 31, 2023, given the significant progress of the work to be performed\n(98.1%) and the level of budget consumption, the impact of accounting estimates is no longer a\ndetermining factor in the calculation of revenue related to the monalizumab agreement.\nEstimate of the recoverable amount of the acquired and under progress licenses\nImpairment tests are performed on a yearly basis for the intangible assets which are not amortized (such\nas intangible assets in progress). The Company is testing amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nwhen there is an indicator of impairment. Impairment tests involve comparing the recoverable amount of\nthe licenses to their net book value. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less\ncosts to sell and its value in use. If the carrying amount of any asset is above its recoverable amount, the\nCompany recognizes an impairment loss to reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The\nmain assumptions used for the impairment test include (a) the amount of cash flows that are set on the\nbasis of the development and commercialization plans and budgets approved by management, (b)\nassumptions related to the achievement of the clinical trials and the launch of the commercialization, (c)\nthe discount rate, (d) assumptions on risk related to the development and (e) for the commercialization,\nselling price and volume of sales, and are provided in Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any change in these assumptions could\n159\nlead to the recognition of an impairment charge that could have a significant impact on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements. In case of failure of the clinical trials in progress, the Company may\nhave to fully depreciate the intangible asset. As of December 31, 2022, given the Company's decision in\nDecember 2022 to discontinue the development of avdoralimab in the indication of BP supporting the\nrecoverable amount of the asset as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the rights related to the\nintangible asset have been fully impaired for the net carrying amount of the intangible asset, of €41,000\nthousand, without using the historical assumptions described above (see Note 6 to the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As a result, the\nCompany considers that there are no longer any critical estimates in line with intangible assets since\n2022. Without any new event to be considered since then, there are therefore no longer any critical\nassumptions that could call into question the recoverable amount of the asset.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe liquidity and capital resources discussion that follows contains certain estimates as of the date of this\nAnnual Report of the Company's estimated future sources and uses of liquidity (including estimated\nfuture capital resources and capital expenditures) and future financial and operating results. These\nestimates reflect numerous assumptions made by Innate with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, and matters\nspecific to its businesses, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond\nits control.\nSources and uses of liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has primarily financed its operations through its receipt of\n$635.4 million (€560.1 million) in payments from its collaborators, including AstraZeneca and Sanofi,\nsince 2011, excluding payments received for purchases of Innate's equity securities by its collaborators.\nInnate has also financed its operations since its inception through several rounds of public and private\nfinancings. Since its inception, Innate has raised a total of €311.4 million through the sale of equity\nsecurities, including €33.7 million in the initial public offering of Innate's ordinary shares on Euronext\nParis in 2006 and €66.0 million in the initial public offering of the Company's initial public offering of its\nordinary shares on Nasdaq in 2019.\nIn addition, Innate has received an aggregate of €100.1 million in research tax credits through December\n31, 2023. As a French biopharmaceutical company, Innate Pharma has benefited from certain tax\nadvantages, including, for example, the research tax credit. The research tax credit can be offset against\nFrench corporate income tax due and the portion in excess, if any, may be refunded. The research tax\ncredit is calculated based on Innate's claimed amount of eligible research and development expenditures\nin France. The research tax credit increased by €1.8 million, or 23% , to €9.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, as compared to a research tax credit of €7.9 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nInnate lost its status as a small or medium size business at the end of the year ended December 31, 2019\nand, therefore, was no longer entitled to the immediate reimbursement of the research tax credit for the\nfiscal year ended 2019 and 2020 but instead will be reimbursed within the expiry of a three-year period.\nThe 2019 tax credit was refunded on February 2023. For the 2021 and 2022 financial year, the Company\nagain met the criteria of an SME according to the criteria of the European Union. As a result, the\nCompany was eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit\nduring the fiscal year 2022. The Company will also be eligible for the early repayment by the French\ntreasury of the 2022 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2023. As of December, 31 2023 financial\n160\nyear, the Company lost again the SME status. As a consequence, the 2023 research tax credit will be paid\nafter a three-year period. If necessary, the Company could mobilize the receivable.\nInnate is potentially eligible to earn milestone payments and royalties under its agreements with\nAstraZeneca in the event that the Company satisfies certain pre-specified milestones. Innate may enter\ninto new collaboration agreements that also provide milestone payments. These milestone payments are\ndependent on the accomplishment of various development, regulatory and commercialization objectives,\nand the achievement of many of these milestones is outside of Innate's control. However, Innate's ability\nto earn these payments and their timing will, in part, be dependent upon the outcome of its research\nactivities, which is uncertain at this time.\nOn July 3, 2017, Innate Pharma borrowed from the bank Société Générale in order to finance the\nconstruction of its future headquarters. This loan, amounting to a maximum of €15.2 million, can be\ndrawn down during the period of the construction in order to pay supplier payments as they become due,\nbut in any event no later than August 30, 2019. Given the development of its portfolio, and in particular\nthe refocusing of its activities on research and development, the Company has for the time being\nsuspended the project to build its new head office on the land acquired in Luminy. In the meantime, the\nloan will be used to finance several structuring projects (improvement of the information system,\ndevelopment of a commercial platform, development of additional premises rented, etc.). Repayment of\nany amounts drawn down are payable over a 12-year term beginning on August 30, 2019 and ending on\nAugust 30, 2031. As security for the loan, Innate pledged collateral in the form of financial instruments\nheld at Société Générale amounting to €15.2 million. The security interest on the pledged financial\ninstruments will be released in accordance with the following schedule: €4.2 million in July 2024,\n€5.0 million in August 2027 and €6.0 million in August 2031. The Company had drawn down €15.2\nmillion under the loan as of December 31, 2019. The loan bears a fixed interest rate of 2.01%. Under the\nloan, Innate is subject to a covenant that its total cash, cash equivalents and current and non-current\nfinancial assets as of each fiscal year end will be at least equal to the amount of outstanding principal\nunder the loan. The repayment period started on August 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2023, the\nremaining capital of this loan amounted to €10.2 million as compared to €11.3 million as of December 31,\n2022.\nOn January 5, 2022, the Company announced that it had obtained non-dilutive financing of €28.7 million\nin the form of two State-Guaranteed Loans (Prêts Garantis “PGE”) from Société Générale\n(€20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (€8.7 million). The funds related to these two PGEs were collected by\nthe Company on December 27 and 30, 2021, respectively. These two loans have an initial maturity of one\nyear, with an option to extend up to five years from August 2022. They are 90% guaranteed by the French\nState as part of a system put in place to support companies in the face of the COVID-19 health crisis. In\nAugust 2022, the Company requested the extension of these two loans repayment for an additional period\nof five years starting in 2022 and including a one-year grace period (2023). Consequently, the Company\nhas obtained agreements from Société Générale and BNP Paribas. The effective interest rates applied to\nthese contracts during the additional period are 1.56% and 0.95% for Société Générale and BNP Paribas\nloans, respectively, excluding insurance and guarantee fees, with an amortization exemption for the entire\nyear 2023. During this grace period, the Company will only be liable for the payment of interest and the\nguarantee fees, with amortization of the two loans starting in 2024 over a period of four years. The state\nguarantee fees amount to €877 thousand and €379 thousand for Société Générale and BNP Paribas loans\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining capital of these loans amounted to €28.7 million.\nLastly, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, Innate also used lease-financing and bank\nloans to finance the acquisition of laboratory equipment and to set up new laboratories. The debt related\nto these loans amounts to €0.2 million at December 31, 2023.\n161\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations (principal amount only) as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\n2 to 5 years\n(in thousands of euro) ≤ 1 year included ≥ 5 years Total\nState guaranteed loan Société Générale 4,884 15,116 — 20,000\nState guaranteed loan BNP Paribas 2,144 6,556 — 8,700\nState guaranteed loans - accrued interest 14 — — 14\nLease liabilities – Building \"Le Virage\" 244 131 — 375\nLease liabilities – Premises Innate Inc 92 154 — 246\nLease liabilities – Laboratory equipment 109 — — 109\nLease liabilities – Vehicles 31 56 — 87\nLease liabilities - Printers 9 9 — 18\nLoans – Equipment 56 43 — 99\nLoan – Building 1,353 5,081 3,814 10,248\nTotal 8,936 27,148 3,814 39,896\nThe table below summarizes Innate's contractual obligations (principal amount and interest) as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\n2 to 5 years\n(in thousands of euro) ≤ 1 year included ≥ 5 years Total\nState guaranteed loan Société Générale 5,167 15,502 — 20,669\nState guaranteed loan BNP Paribas 2,222 6,662 — 8,884\nLease liabilities – Building \"Le Virage\" 255 133 — 388\nLease liabilities – Premises Innate Inc 95 157 — 252\nLease liabilities – Laboratory equipment 109 — — 109\nLease liabilities – Vehicles 33 56 — 89\nLease liabilities - Printers 9 9 — 18\nLoans – Equipment 57 43 — 100\nLoan – Building 1,545 5,587 3,923 11,056\nTotal 9,492 28,149 3,923 41,565\nLiquidity position\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by €9.0 million, or 9%, to €92.5 million as\nof December 31, 2023, as compared to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of €101.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents are mainly composed of current bank\naccounts, interest-bearing accounts, fixed-term accounts and money market funds as per AMF definition.\nShort-term investments primarily consist of shares of mutual funds and all investments with a maturity\nless than one year. Their purpose is to finance Innate's activities, including Innate's research and\ndevelopment costs.\nAs a reminder, Innate has received a total of €306.4 million in cash from capital increases, before\ndeducting the costs associated with capital increases, and after excluding proceeds from share\n162\ncompensation instruments, between 1999 and December 31, 2019. The table below summarizes the main\ncapital increases between 1999 and December 31, 2023 :\nDate Gross Proceeds\nApril 2000 € 1.2 million\nMarch 2001 3.3 million\nJuly 2002 20.0 million\nMarch 2004 5.0 million\nJuly 2004 10.0 million\nMarch 2006 10.0 million\nNovember 2006 33.7 million\nDecember 2009 24.3 million\nNovember 2013 20.3 million\nJune 2014 50.0 million\nOctober 2018 62.6 million\nOctober 2019 66.0 million\nTotal € 306.4 million\nCash flows\nComparisons for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023:\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from / (used in) operating activities\n€ (19,155) € (32,558)\nCash flows from / (used in) investing activities\n1,877 20,631\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities\n(1,828) (1,966)\nEffect of the exchange rate changes\n(428) 274\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n€ (19,532) € (13,619)\nCash flows from / (used in) operating activities\nThe Company's net cash flow used in operating activities decreased by €13.4 million to €32.6 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of €19.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This variation is mainly due to (i) the receipt of €25.0\nmillion from Sanofi in March 2023 following the entry into force of the research collaboration and\nlicensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Genzyme Corporation,\na wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi (\"Sanofi\") an exclusive licence to Innate Pharma's B7H3 ANKET®\n163\nprogram and options on two additional targets, (ii) the receipt in May 2023 of a payment of €4.6 million\n($5.0 million) received from Takeda following the conclusion of an exclusive licensing agreement under\nwhich Innate granted Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of ADCs, (iii)\nthe receipt in July 2023 of €2.0 million following the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical\ntrial sponsored by Sanofi evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple\nmyeloma. Lastly, during 2023, the Company benefited from the early repayment of the research tax credit\nclaim relating to the 2022 financial year, amounting to €9.2 million, paid to the Company by the French\nTreasury in July 2023. As a reminder, cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December\n31, 2022, included successive (i) the collection of €47.7 million ($50.0 million) and €4.9 million ($5.0\nmillion) in June 2022 and August 2022,respectively, under the monalizumab agreement and the\namendment to the IPH5201 collaboration and option agreement, (ii) the collection of €3.0 million\nreceived from Sanofi under the 2016 agreement and following Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/\nSAR'514 into regulatory preclinical studies for an investigational new drug, and (iii) in 2022, the\nCompany collected the early repayment of the research tax credit receivable relating to the 2021 financial\nyear for an amount of €10.3 million, paid to the Company by the French Treasury in November 2022.\nThese collections were partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20, 2022\npursuant to the Termination and Transition Agreement and cash outflows related to the Company's\noperating activities. Not considering these specific effects, net cash flows used by operating activities for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by €5.5 million. This decrease is mainly explained by the\ndecrease in the Company's research and development activities, notably related to preclinical trials, and\nalso by higher cash outflows related to the re-invoicing of costs to AstraZeneca for the Phase 3 trials\nevaluating monalizumab, INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9, in accordance with the Company's co-\nfinancing commitments and the reduction in staff costs related to the reduction of staff in the Company.\nNet cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation\nare nil for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to € 5.1 million for the year 2022. In 2022, the\ncash consumption related to the payment to AstraZeneca of €5.9 million in April 2022 under the\nTermination and Transition Agreement.\nCash flows from / (used in) investing activities\nThe Company's net cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted\nto €20.6 million and are mainly composed of a disposal of a non-current financial instrument which\ngenerated a net cash collection of €22.8 million partially offset by acquisitions of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets for a net amount €2.2 million. As a reminder, net cash flow used in\ninvesting activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €1.9 million and were mainly\ncomprised of acquisitions of tangibles assets and disposal of a current financial instrument liquidation for\n€3.0 million.\nNet cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation\nwere nil for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities\nThe Company's net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023\nincreased by €0.1 million to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to net cash\nflows from financing activities of €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLoan repayments amounted to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to €2.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition, net cash flows from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operations are nil\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n164\nComparisons for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022:\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from / (used in) operating activities\n€ (58,457) € (19,155)\nCash flows from / (used in) investing activities\n(917) 1,877\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities\n26,819 (1,828)\nEffect of the exchange rate changes\n(483) (428)\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n€ (33,039) € (19,532)\nCash flows from / (used in) operating activities\nThe Company's net cash flow used in operating activities decreased by €39.3 million to €19.2 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of €58.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase mainly results from (i) the collection of\n€47.7 million ($50.0 million) and €4.9 million ($5.0 million) in June 2022 and August 2022,respectively,\nunder the monalizumab agreement and the amendment to the IPH5201 collaboration and option\nagreement, (ii) the collection of €3.0 million received from Sanofi under the 2016 agreement and\nfollowing Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 into regulatory preclinical studies for an\ninvestigational new drug. Finally, (iii) the Company collected during 2022 the early repayment of the\nresearch tax credit receivable relating to the 2021 financial year for an amount of €10.3 million, paid to\nthe Company by the French Treasury in November 2022. These collections are partially offset by the €5.9\nmillion payment to AstraZeneca on April 20, 2022 pursuant to the Termination and Transition Agreement\nand cash outflows related to the Company's operating activities. As a reminder, cash flows used in\noperating activities for year ended December 31, 2021, included successive receipts for a total amount of\n€10.0 million from Sanofi (in January, February and December 2021) in connection with the IPH6101/\nSAR443579 agreement signed in 2016, following Sanofi's decision at the end of 2020 to advance\nIPH6101/SAR443579 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug, and the\nlaunch of the first related Phase 1 trial in December 2021. Restated of these receipts and payments, net\ncash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December, 2022 increased by €10.4 million.\nThis increase is mainly explained by the increase in the Company's research and development activities,\nnotably related to pre-clinical trials, and also by higher cash outflows related to the re-invoicing of costs\nto AstraZeneca for the Phase 3 trials evaluating monalizumab, INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9, in\naccordance with the Company's co-financing commitments.\nNet cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation\namounted to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to € 3.6 million for the year\n2021. This increase is mainly related to the payment to AstraZeneca of €5.9 million in April 2022 under\nthe Termination and Transition Agreement.\n165\nCash flows from / (used in) investing activities\nThe Company's net cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted\nto €1.9 million and are mainly composed of a disposal of a non-current financial instrument which\ngenerated a net cash collection of €3.0 million partially offset by acquisitions of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets for €1.1 million. As a reminder, net cash flow used in investing activities\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to €0.9 million and were mainly comprised of\nacquisitions of tangibles assets.\nNet cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation\nwere nil for year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31 2021, respectively.\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities\nThe Company's net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022\ndecreased by €28.6 million to €1.8 million as compared to net cash flows from financing activities of\n€26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a reminder, the Company's obtained in 2021 a\nnon-dilutive financing of €28.7 million in the form of two State guaranteed loans from Société Générale\n(€20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (€8.7 million). The Company received the funds related to these two\nloans on December 27 and 30, 2021, respectively.\nLoan repayments amounted to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €2.1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for\nyear ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFunding requirements\nInnate Pharma believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and non-current\nfinancial assets, will enable it to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months. Innate has based this\nestimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its capital resources\nsooner than it currently expects.\nUntil Innate can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the sale of approved products, if ever, it\nexpects to finance its operating activities through its existing liquidity and expected milestone payments\nfrom collaborators.\nInnate's present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, among other\nthings:\n• the size, progress, timing and completion of its clinical trials and preclinical studies for any\ncurrent or future product candidates, including its lead product candidates, monalizumab and\nlacutamab;\n• the number of potential new product candidates Innate identifies and decides to develop;\n• costs associated with its payment obligations to third parties in connection with its\ndevelopment and potential commercialization of certain of its product candidates;\n• costs associated with expanding its organization;\n• the costs involved in filing patent applications and maintaining and enforcing patents or\ndefending against claims of infringement raised by third parties;\n166\n• the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval for its product candidates and any\ndelays the Company may encounter as a result of evolving regulatory requirements or adverse\nresults with respect to any of these product candidates;\n• the amount of revenues, if any, Innate Pharma may derive either directly, or in the form of\nmilestone or royalty payments from any future potential partnership agreements, from\nmonalizumab, IPH5201, IPH6101/SAR443579, IPH6401/SAR'514, B7H3 or other target or\nrelating to its other product candidates.\nFor more information as to the risks associated with Innate's future funding needs, see “Risk Factors—\nThe Company may need to raise additional funding to complete the development and any\ncommercialization of its product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all,\nand failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force the Company to delay, limit or\nterminate its product development efforts or other operations.”\nCapital expenditures\nInnate Pharma's operations mainly require investment in intangible assets. Innate acquired the rights of\navdoralimab from Novo Nordisk A/S in 2017. The Company paid an upfront fee of €40.0 million, of\nwhich €37.2 million was contributed in new ordinary shares and €2.8 million in cash. As part of this\nagreement, an additional amount of € 1.0 million was paid in October 2020 to Novo Nordisk A / S\nfollowing the launch of the first avdoralimab Phase 2 trial.\nIn January 2019, Innate Pharma paid to AstraZeneca an initial payment for the license related to Lumoxiti\n($50.0 million, or €43.8 million, using the foreign exchange rate of 1.1422 at the date of payment), and in\nFebruary 2019, Innate paid to Novo Nordisk A/S additional consideration relating to monalizumab\n($15.0 million, or €13.1 million, using the exchange rate of 1.1394 at the date of payment). In June 2019,\nInnate paid €7.0 million to Orega Biotech in relation to the anti-CD39 program as consideration following\nthe collaboration and option agreement signed on October 22, 2018 with AstraZeneca regarding IPH5201.\nInnate's operations generally require little investment in tangible assets because the Company outsources\nmost of the manufacturing and research activities to third parties. Innate Pharma leases some of its\ncomputer equipment under operating lease agreements. Innate accounts for its payments for these items as\noperating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.\nThe Company's capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 primarily\nrelated to laboratory equipment. Clinical research and development costs are not capitalized until\nmarketing authorizations are obtained.\nInnate's corporate office in Luminy, Marseille, France is leased under a finance lease agreement signed in\n2008 with Sogebail, a subsidiary of Société Générale, for an aggregate amount of €6.6 million. The lease-\nfinancing agreement has a 12-year term. Innate has a purchase option for all of the buildings and land for\nthe lump sum of €1 at the end of the term of the contract on June 9, 2020, which it has exercised. The\nCompany now owns its corporate office in Luminy, Marseille.\nSince July 2017, Innate also rents office space in Marseille, France under a commercial lease.\nOn January 10, 2020, the Company signed an amendment to the lease for the “Le Virage” building in\norder to expand its premises. This amendment also extended the duration of the contractual commitment\nuntil 2025.\nOn March 13, 2023, the Company signed an amendment to the lease for \"Le Virage Building\" in order to\nreduce the rental area of its premises located in the \"Le Virage\" building. This amendment has the effect\nof reducing the amount of the commitment relating to rent by €685 thousand. The Company remains\ncommitted under this contract until June 30, 2025.\n167\nC.

In case of outperformance for the year 2024, the amount of the bonus may be\nincreased beyond 100% up to a limit of 150% based on other predefined criteria.\nThe outperformance targets may only be reached if 100% of the baseline targets are reached.\nAt the general meeting of shareholders of the Company to be held on May 23, 2024, the allocation of free\nperformance shares subject to capitalization evolution and internal conditions will be put to the vote of its\nshareholders.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification Matters\nUnder French law, provisions of bylaws that limit the liability of the members of Executive and\nSupervisory Boards are prohibited. However, French law allows sociétés anonymes to contract for and\nmaintain liability insurance against civil liabilities incurred by members of Executive and Supervisory\nBoards involved in a third-party action, provided that they acted in good faith and within their capacities\nas members of such Boards of the Company. Criminal liability cannot be indemnified under French law,\nwhether directly by the Company or through liability insurance.\nThe Company has a liability insurance for its Executive and Supervisory Board members, and insurance\ncoverage for liability under the Securities Act. The Company also entered into agreements with its\nExecutive and Supervisory Board members to provide contractual indemnification. With certain\nexceptions and subject to limitations on indemnification under French law, these agreements provide for\nindemnification for damages and expenses including, among other things, attorneys’ fees, judgments,\nfines and settlement amounts incurred by any Executive or Supervisory Board member in any action or\nproceeding arising out of his or her actions in that capacity. The Company believes that this insurance and\nthese agreements are necessary to attract qualified Executive and Supervisory Board members.\nThese agreements may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against the Executive and\nSupervisory Board members for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect\nof reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against the Executive and Supervisory Board members,\neven though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders.\nFurthermore, a shareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent the Company pays the\ncosts of settlement and damages awards against its Executive and Supervisory Board members pursuant\nto these insurance agreements.\n181\nEquity Incentives\nThe Company believes that the ability to grant equity incentives is a valuable and necessary compensation\ntool that allows the Company to attract and retain the best personnel for positions of substantial\nresponsibility, provides additional incentives to employees and promotes the success of its business. Due\nto French corporate law and tax considerations, the Company has historically granted several different\nequity incentive instruments to its Executive Board and Supervisory Board members, employees and\nconsultants, including (i) warrants (BSAs), which have historically only been granted to independent\nmembers of the Supervisory Board and consultants, (ii) redeemable warrants (BSAARs) and (iii) free\nshares.\nThe Executive Board’s authority to grant these warrants and free shares and the aggregate amount\nauthorized to be granted must be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders present at the relevant\nextraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Once approved by the shareholders, the Executive Board can\ncontinue to grant such awards for a specified period upon prior authorization of the Supervisory Board.\nThe Company has various compensation plans for its Executive Board members, Supervisory Board\nmembers, employees and consultants that have been approved by the shareholders. The last allocation of\nBSAARs which occurred in 2015 no longer continues to vest following termination of the employment,\noffice or service of the holder within the first two years and all vested warrants must be exercised within\npost-termination exercise periods set forth in the issuance agreement. In the event of certain changes in its\nshare capital structure, such as a consolidation or share split or dividend, French law and applicable\nissuance agreement provides for appropriate adjustments of the numbers of ordinary shares issuable and/\nor the exercise price of the outstanding warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had the following equity awards, warrants and free shares\noutstanding:\n• 242,460 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of share warrants (BSA) outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 at a weighted average exercise price of 8,38 € per ordinary share;\n• 1,045,722 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of redeemable share warrants (BSAAR)\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023 at an exercise price of 7,20 € per ordinary share;\n• 757,190 ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of 6,263 free preferred shares (AGAP 2016)\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023;\n• 25,000 ordinary shares issuable upon the vesting of 25,000 free shares ( New Member 2023) as of\nDecember 31, 2023;\n• 1,299,300 ordinary shares issuable upon definitive acquisition of 1,299,300 free performance shares\n2021 as of December 31, 2023 (AGA de Performance 2021), assuming all the performance and\npresence conditions are met;\n• 1,723,500 ordinary shares issuable upon definitive acquisition of 1,723,500 free performance shares\n2022 as of December 31, 2023 (AGA de Performance 2022), assuming all the performance and\npresence conditions are met;\n• 2,149,000 ordinary shares issuable upon definitive acquisition of 2,149,000 free performance shares\n2023 as of December 31, 2023 (AGA de Performance 2023), assuming all the performance and\npresence conditions are met.\n182\nEquity Warrants and Redeemable Share Subscription Warrants\nShare Warrants (BSA)\nShare warrants (BSA) are issued at a de minimis price and entitle the holder of one BSA to exercise the\nwarrant for one underlying share, at an exercise price per share determined by the Executive Board of the\nCompany at the time of issue by reference to the then prevailing share price. The Company has issued\nBSA to Supervisory Board members and certain consultants of the Company. The Company's BSA plans\ninclude provisions that allow for the adjustment of the one-for-one exercise ratio to compensate for\ncertain modifications of its share capital, such as rights issues, stock splits, mergers and other events\naffecting all existing shareholders. None of those events have occurred yet. The Company's BSA have an\nexercise period of 10 years – BSA not exercised after that time lapse and are automatically cancelled. The\nCompany's BSA cannot be sold.\nThe following table shows the BSA outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nPlan title BSA 2014 BSA 2015-1 BSA 2015-2 BSA 2017 BSA 2022 BSA 2023\nShareholder general March 27, April 27, April 27, May 20, May 12,\nJune 2, 2016\nmeeting date 2014 2015 2015 2022 2023\nApril 27, September October 3, October 19,\nDate of issue July 16, 2014 July 1, 2015\n2015 20, 2017 2022 2023\nTotal number of BSA\n150,000 150,000 150,000 150,000 50,000 70,000\nauthorized\nTotal number of BSA\n150,000 70,000 14,200 37,000 8,260 38,000\nissued\nStart date of the exercise April 27, September October 3, October 19,\nJuly 16, 2014 July 1, 2015\nperiod 2015 20, 2017 2024 2025\nEnd date of the exercise April 26, June 30, September October 3, October 19,\nJuly 16, 2024\nperiod 2025 2025 20, 2027 2032 2033\nExercise price per BSA/\n€8.65 €9.59 €14.05 €11 €2.31 €2.26\nshare\nNumber of BSA\nexercised as of 75,000 — — — — —\nDecember 31, 2023\nBSA cancelled or lapsed\nas of December 31, — — — — — —\n2023\nBSA remaining as of\n75,000 70,000 14,200 37,000 8,260 38,000\nDecember 31, 2023\nRedeemable Share Warrants (BSAAR)\nRedeemable share warrants, or BSAAR, are identical to the share warrants of BSA (including the one-for-\none exercise ratio, its potential adjustment for certain modifications of the share capital and the exercise\nperiod of 10 years), except for the following features:\n• the BSAAR are initially purchased by the beneficiary at their fair value, as determined by an expert,\nand\n183\n• the BSAAR plans include a “forcing” clause making it possible to encourage holders to exercise\ntheir BSAAR when the market price exceeds the exercise price and reaches a threshold defined in\nthe BSAAR issuance agreement. The Company can then, subject to a time period for notifying the\nholders that will permit them to exercise their BSAAR, decide to purchase the unexercised BSAAR\nat a unit price equal to the BSAAR acquisition price initially paid by their holders.\nInnate's redeemable share warrants cannot be sold. The BSAAR have been granted to certain of the\nexecutive officers and employees.\nThe following table shows the BSAAR outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nPlan title BSAAR 2015\nShareholder general meeting date April 27, 2015\nDate of issue July 1, 2015\nTotal number of BSAAR issued 1,050,382\nStart date of the exercise period July 1, 2015\nEnd date of the exercise period June 30, 2025\nBSAAR initial purchase price €1.15\nExercise price per BSAAR/share €7.20\nNumber of BSAAR exercised as of December 31, 2023 1,940\nBSAAR cancelled or lapsed as of December 31, 2023 2,720\nBSAAR remaining as of December 31, 2023 1,045,722\nFree Shares (AGA)\nFree shares (AGA) are employee equity incentive instruments pursuant to which the beneficiaries are\ngranted, for free, the possibility to receive ordinary shares under certain conditions. Upon grant by the\nExecutive Board of the Company, the AGA are subject to an acquisition, or vesting, period of at least one\nyear. At the end of this period, the free shares vest and the beneficiary becomes a full shareholder.\nHowever, if the vesting period is less than a certain period set by law (currently two years), it must be\nfollowed by a holding period, so that the sum of the vesting period and the holding period is equal to a\nminimum total period also set by law (currently two years). Vesting can be conditional or not. The vesting\nof all or the Company's AGA is subject to a presence condition at the end of the vesting period. Some of\nthe Company's AGA are also subject to performance conditions. Over the years, the Company has\nestablished several AGA plans, for its employees or for management only, sometimes as a “welcome\npackage” (with no performance conditions). The Company's free share plans include provisions that allow\nfor the adjustment of the number of ordinary shares to which a beneficiary is entitled at the end of the\nvesting period to compensate for certain modifications of its share capital, such as rights issues, stock\nsplits, mergers and other events affecting all existing shareholders, during the vesting period. Certain of\n184\nthe Company's plans also provide for an accelerated vesting in case of a tender offer on the Company\nduring the vesting period.\nThe following table shows the AGAs outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nAGA Perf AGA Perf AGA Perf AGA Perf AGA Perf AGA Perf\nPlan title (1) Employees Management Employees Management Employees Management\n2021 2021 2022 2022 2023 2023\nShareholder general May 20,\nMay 28, 2021 May 28, 2021 May 20, 2022 May 12, 2023 May 12, 2023\nmeeting date 2022\nOctober 1, October 1, December December 12, December 21, December 21,\nDate of grant\n2021 2021 12, 2022 2022 2023 2023\nVesting Period 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years\nHolding period None None None None None None\nPerformance\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nConditions\nNumber of AGA\n1,066,600 610,000 1,371,500 550,000 1,403,500 750,000\ngranted\nNumber of vested\nAGA as of — — — — — —\nDecember 31, 2023\nNumber of lapsed\nAGA as of 247,300 130,000 198,000 0 4,500 0\nDecember 31, 2023\nNumber of AGA under\na vesting period as\n819,300 480,000 1,173,500 550,000 1,399,000 750,000\nof December 31,\n2023\n(1) Usually after the end of the vesting period, the Executive Board will convene and acknowledge the number of free shares that have vested\nand the number of those that have not because the presence condition and, as applicable, the performance conditions, have not been met.\nFor the purpose of computing the amount of share-based compensation in its consolidated financial statements, AGA that have lapsed\nbecause the presence condition has not been met, are excluded from the computation, even though the Executive Board has not met yet\nand formally acknowledged this fact. As a result, certain of the numbers above are different from those in its consolidated financial\nstatements.\n185\nThe following authorization will be submitted for approval to the general meeting of the shareholders to\nbe held on May 23, 2024: (i) up to 1,425,000 free shares with performance conditions to the benefit of\nexecutive officers, employed members of the Leadership Team, employed senior executives and/or\ncorporate officers, (ii) up to 1,200,000 free shares with performance conditions to the benefit of\nemployees, (iii) up to 300,000 free shares to the benefit of new executive officers without performance\nconditions, (iv) up to 300,000 free shares to the benefit of employees and Leadership Team and Executive\nBoard (excluding the Chairman) members as part of the employee saving plan, (v) up to 150,000 stock\noptions to the benefit of new executive officers and (vi) up to 40,000 warrants to the benefit of\nindependent Supervisory Board members to be issued at the fair market value.\nFree Preferred Shares (AGAP)\nFree preferred shares (AGAP) are another employee equity incentive instrument similar to the free shares\nor AGA, except that, after a one-year vesting period, the beneficiaries receive a preferred shares (shares\nB) which will become convertible into ordinary shares following a lock-up period of two additional years,\nif the performance conditions (and a presence condition) are met at the end of this lock-up period. Each\nfree preferred share is convertible into a number of ordinary shares of the Company – which number\ndepends upon the degree of fulfilment of the performance conditions. The free preferred shares remain\nconvertible into ordinary shares for a period of six years and six months. Free preferred shares not\nconverted at the end of this conversion period can be repurchased by Innate and cancelled. The\nCompany's AGAP cannot be sold.\nThe Company has established several AGAP plans in 2016 and 2017 for all of its employees or for\nmanagement only.\nSince the end of the lock-up period, holders of the 2016 AGAP that have not yet converted them into\nordinary shares, are entitled to vote at the shareholders’ meetings, to dividends and to preferential\nsubscription rights, on the basis of the number of ordinary shares to which they are entitled if they convert\ntheir AGAP.\nOn October 21, 2019, the performance criteria of the 2016-1 AGAP were assessed and the conversion\nratio was determined as follows: one 2016-1 AGAP gives right to 130 ordinary shares.\nOn December 30, 2019, the performance criteria of the 2016-2 AGAP were assessed and the conversion\nratio was determined as follows: one 2016-2 AGAP gives right to 111 ordinary shares.\nThe 2017 AGAP are not convertible since the performance criteria were not met.\n186\nThe following table shows the AGAPs outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nAGAP AGAP AGAP\nManagement Management Employees\nPlan title 2016-1 2016-2 2016-1\nShareholder general meeting date June 2, 2016 June 2, 2016 June 2, 2016\nDate of grant October 21, December October 21,\n2016 30, 2016 2016\nNumber of AGAP granted 2,000 3,000 2,486\nMaximum number of ordinary shares 130 111 130\ninto which each AGAP can be\nconverted\nNumber of AGAP lapsed during the 450 — 105\nvesting period\nNumber of vested AGAP 1,550 3,000 2,381\nNumber of lapsed AGAP during the 100 — 146\nlock up period\nNumber of outstanding AGAP 1,200 3,000 2,063\nC. Board Practices\nSupervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board is made up of a minimum of three members and a maximum of eighteen. The\nmembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a renewable term of two years at the general meeting\nof shareholders, which may revoke their appointments at any time.

Eric Vivier, the Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, is a\npermanent guest to the meetings of the Leadership Team.\nCorporate Governance Practices\nAs a French société anonyme, the Company is subject to various corporate governance requirements\nunder French law. The Company is a “foreign private issuer” under the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe Nasdaq listing rules. As a foreign private issuer listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we will be\nsubject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. However, the Nasdaq Global Market’s\nlisting standards provide that foreign private issuers, as defined in the rules promulgated under the U.S.\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”), are permitted to follow home\ncountry corporate governance practices instead of certain Nasdaq listing requirements, with certain\nexceptions. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of Nasdaq listing\nrequirements must submit to Nasdaq a written statement from an independent counsel in such issuer’s\nhome country certifying that the issuer’s practices are not prohibited by the home country’s laws.\nThe Company applies the Middlenext code, which recommends that at least two members of the\nSupervisory Board be independent (as such term is defined under the code). Certain corporate governance\npractices in France may differ significantly from Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards.\nNeither the corporate laws of France nor the bylaws requires that (i) a majority of the Members of our\nSupervisory Board be independent or (ii) the independent members of the Supervisory Board hold\nregularly scheduled meetings at which only independent members of the Supervisory Board are present.\nOther than as set forth below, the Company currently intends to comply with the corporate governance\nlisting standards of Nasdaq to the extent possible under French law. However, we may choose to change\nsuch practices to follow home country practice in the future.\nAlthough we are a foreign private issuer, these exemptions do not modify the independence requirements\nfor the Audit Committee. Pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Nasdaq\nListing Rules, our Audit Committee must be composed of at least three independent members. Rule\n10A-3 under the Exchange Act provides that the Audit Committee must have direct responsibility for the\nnomination, compensation and choice of the auditors, as well as control over the performance of their\nduties, management of complaints made, and selection of consultants. Under Rule 10A-3, if the laws of a\nforeign private issuer’s home country require that any such matter be approved by our Supervisory Board\nor the shareholders of the Company, the Audit Committee’s responsibilities or powers with respect to\nsuch matter may instead be advisory. Under French law, the Audit Committee may only have an advisory\nrole and appointment of the statutory auditors, in particular, must be decided by the shareholders at the\nannual meeting.\nIn addition, Nasdaq Listing Rules require that a listed company specify that the quorum for any meeting\nof the holders of share capital be at least 33 1/3% of the outstanding shares of the company’s ordinary\nvoting shares. The Company intends to follow its French home country practice, rather than complying\nwith this Nasdaq Listing Rule. Consistent with French Law, the Company's bylaws provide that when\nfirst convened, general meetings of shareholders may validly convene only if the shareholders present or\nrepresented hold at least (1) 20% of the voting shares in the case of an ordinary general meeting or of an\nextraordinary general meeting where shareholders are voting on a capital increase by capitalization of\nreserves, profits or share premium, or (2) 25% of the voting shares in the case of any other extraordinary\ngeneral meeting. If such quorum required by French law is not met, the meeting is adjourned. There is no\n192\nquorum requirement under French law when an ordinary general meeting or an extraordinary general\nmeeting is reconvened where shareholders are voting on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves,\nprofits or share premium, but the reconvened meeting may consider only questions that were on the\nagenda of the adjourned meeting. When any other extraordinary general meeting is reconvened, the\nrequired quorum under French law is 20% of the shares entitled to vote. The reconvened meeting may\nconsider only questions that were on the agenda of the adjourned meeting. If a quorum is not met at a\nreconvened meeting requiring a quorum, then the meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two\nmonths.\nFinally, the Company follows French law with respect to shareholder approval requirements in lieu of the\nvarious shareholder approval requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, which requires a Nasdaq listed\ncompany to obtain shareholder approval prior to certain issuances of securities, including: (a) issuances in\nconnection with the acquisition of the stock or assets of another company if upon issuance the issued\nshares will equal 20% or more of the number of shares or voting power outstanding prior to the issuance,\nor if certain specified persons have a 5% or greater interest in the assets or company to be acquired\n(Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a)); (b) issuances or potential issuances that will result in a change of control\nof us (Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b)); (c) issuances in connection with equity compensation arrangements\n(Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)); and (d) 20% or greater issuances in transactions other than public\nofferings, as defined in the Nasdaq rules (Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d)). Under French law, the\nCompany’s shareholders may approve issuances of equity, as a general matter, through the adoption of\ndelegation of authority resolutions at the Company’s meeting of shareholders pursuant to which\nshareholders may delegate their authority to the Executive Board to increase the Company’s share capital\nwithin specified parameters set by the shareholders, which may include a time limitation to carry out the\nshare capital increase, the cancellation of their preferential subscription rights to the benefit of named\npersons or a category of persons, specified price limitations and/or specific or aggregate limitations on the\nsize of the share capital increase. Due to differences between French law and corporate governance\npractices and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, the Company follows French home country practice, rather than\ncomplying with this Nasdaq Listing Rule.\nIn accordance with French law, committees of our Supervisory Board will only have an advisory role and\ncan only make recommendations to our Supervisory Board.

The cost and provision of these services are negotiated on an arm's-length\nbasis, and none of these arrangements are material.\nRelated Person Transaction Policy\nThe Company complies with French law regarding approval of transactions with related parties. On\nSeptember 12, 2019, the Supervisory Board adopted a related person transaction policy that sets forth its\nprocedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of related person\ntransactions. The policy became effective immediately upon the execution of the underwriting agreement\nfor the October 2019 global offering. For purposes of its policy only, a related person transaction is a\ntransaction, arrangement or similar contractual relationship, or any series of similar transactions,\narrangements or relationships, in which the Company and any related person are, were or will be\nparticipants and the amount involved in the transaction exceeds $120,000, with the exception of usual\ntransactions concluded under normal conditions. A related person is any member of the Executive Board\nor Supervisory Board or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of its voting securities, including\nany of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.\nUnder the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any\ntransaction that was not a related person transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that\nwas not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, the management must\npresent information regarding the related person transaction to the Supervisory Board for review,\nconsideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other\nthings, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to Innate of\nthe transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or\nfrom, as the case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy,\nthe Company will collect information that the Company deems reasonably necessary from each member\nof its Executive Board and Supervisory Board and, to the extent feasible, significant shareholder to enable\nInnate to identify any existing or potential related-person transactions and to effectuate the terms of the\npolicy.\nIn addition, under its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which Innate Pharma adopted on September\n12, 2019, its employees and Executive and Supervisory Board members have an affirmative responsibility\n199\nto disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of\ninterest.\nIn considering related person transactions, the Supervisory Board will take into account the relevant\navailable facts and circumstances including, but not limited to:\n• the risks, costs and benefits to us;\n• the impact on the independence of a member of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board in the\nevent that the related person is a member of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board, an\nimmediate family member of a member of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board or an entity\nwith which a member of Executive Board or Supervisory Board is affiliated;\n• the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and\n• the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees\ngenerally.\nThe policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction,\nthe Supervisory Board must consider, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is\nnot inconsistent with, the Company's best interests and those of its shareholders, as the Supervisory Board\ndetermines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.\nAll of the transactions described above were evaluated and approved by the Supervisory Board.\nC.

Material Contracts.\nStrategic Collaborations and License Agreements\nAstraZeneca\n2015 Agreements\nIn April 2015, the Company entered into two agreements with MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary\nof AstraZeneca, which Innate refers to as AstraZeneca. The first agreement was a co-development and\nlicense agreement relating to certain combination products containing monalizumab ( the \"Original Co-\nDevelopment Agreement\"), and the second agreement was a development and option agreement for\nproducts containing monalizumab, including products using monalizumab as a monotherapy (the \"2015\nOption Agreement\"). The Company received an initial payment of $250 million under these agreements\non June 30, 2015, of which $100 million was paid to Innate as an initial payment for the Original Co-\nDevelopment Agreement and $150 million was paid to Innate as consideration for the 2015 Option\nAgreement described below. In October 2018, AstraZeneca exercised its option under the 2015 Option\nAgreement, which resulted in the automatic termination of both the Original Co-Development Agreement\nand the 2015 Option Agreement, and a new co-development and license agreement relating to all products\ncontaining monalizumab (the \"2015 Co-Development Agreement\"), automatically came into effect. In\nconnection with AstraZeneca’s exercise of its option under the 2015 Option Agreement, an upfront\npayment of $100 million was due under the 2015 Co-Development Agreement, which it paid in January\n2019.\n2015 Co-Development Agreement (monalizumab)\nUnder the 2015 Co-Development Agreement, the Company granted to AstraZeneca a worldwide,\nexclusive license, subject to certain exclusions, to certain of its patents and know-how to develop,\nmanufacture and commercialize licensed products, including monalizumab, in the field of diagnosis,\nprevention and treatment of oncology diseases and conditions. The Company further granted to\nAstraZeneca a worldwide, non-exclusive license to certain of its other patents to develop, manufacture\nand commercialize licensed products, including monalizumab, in the field of diagnosis, prevention and\ntreatment of oncology diseases and conditions. The Company retains the rights under the licensed patents\nand know-how to, among other things, co-promote licensed products in certain European\ncountries,pursuant to its option to co-promote, and exploit the licensed patents and know-how to research,\ndevelop and commercialize the licensed products outside of the field of diagnosis, prevention and\ntreatment of oncology diseases and conditions.\nUnder the 2015 Co-Development Agreement, the Company is required to collaborate with AstraZeneca to\ndevelop and commercialize licensed products. AstraZeneca will be the lead party in developing the\nlicensed products and licensed product in certain major markets. Each party will have to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to complete certain development activities in accordance with a specified\ndevelopment plan.\nThe Company is required for a defined period of time to co-fund 30% of the Phase 3 clinical trials of\nlicensed products, subject to an aggregate cap, in order to receive 50% of the profits in Europe.\nOn July 31, 2019, the Company notified AstraZeneca of its decision to co-fund future monalizumab\nPhase 3 clinical development program. In October 2020, AstraZeneca enrolled the first patient in the first\nPhase 3 trial which triggered a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca to Innate.\nIn August 2022, the Company announced that the planned futility interim analysis of the INTERLINK-1\nPhase 3 study sponsored by AstraZeneca did not meet a pre-defined threshold for efficacy. Based on this\n206\nresult and the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, AstraZeneca has informed\nCompany that the study will be discontinued.\nIn September 2021, AstraZeneca, based on data from the randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with\nunresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented at the European Society for\nMedical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial for both combinations of\nmonalizumab or oleclumab plus durvalumab in the unresectable, Stage III NSCLC setting for patients\nwho had not progressed after concurrent chemoradiationtherapy.\nIn April 2022, the Company announced that AstraZeneca enrolled the first patient in a second Phase 3\ntrial, PACIFIC-9, evaluating durvalumab in a combination with monalizumab or oleclumab in patients\nwith unresectable, Stage III NSCLC, which trigerred a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca\nInnate.\nSeparately, AstraZeneca also announced that it is starting a Phase 2 clinical trial, NeoCOAST-2, that\nincludes a treatment arm with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and monalizumab in\nresectable, early-stage NSCLC.\nAstraZeneca will be responsible for the promotion of licensed products worldwide, subject to Innate's\noption to co-promote the licensed products in certain European countries. Should the Company elect not\nto co-promote, its share of profits in Europe will be reduced by a specified amount of percentage points\nnot to exceed the mid-single digits.\nThe development by AstraZeneca of a licensed product under the 2015 Co-Development Agreement is\nsubject to certain reciprocal non-compete obligations.\nAstraZeneca is obligated to pay Innate up to $775 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of\ncertain development and regulatory milestones ($350million), and commercialization milestones ($425\nmillion). As described above, the arrangement also provides for a 50% profit share and, subject to certain\ndeferrals of reimbursement, loss share of licensed products in Europe if the Company does not opt out of\nits co-funding and co-promoting obligations. In addition, the Company will be eligible to receive tiered\nroyalties ranging from a low double-digit to mid-teen percentage on net sales of licensed products outside\nof Europe. The royalties payable to Innate under the 2015 Co-Development Agreement may be reduced\nunder certain circumstances, including loss of exclusivity or lack of patent protection.\nInnate's right to receive royalties under the 2015 Co-Development Agreement expires, on a licensed\nproduct-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, on the latest of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the\nfirst commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, or in the case of European countries, in\nany European country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such\ncountry and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid licensed patent claim subject to the agreement\nthat covers such licensed product in such country.\nUnless earlier terminated, the term of the 2015 Co-Development Agreement will expire on the date on\nwhich all of AstraZeneca’s payment obligations have expired. The Company may terminate the 2015 Co-\nDevelopment Agreement if AstraZeneca challenges any patent licensed to it under the agreement.\nAstraZeneca may terminate the 2015 Co-Development Agreement in its entirety for convenience at any\ntime effective upon 120 days’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the 2015 Co-\nDevelopment Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or for certain\nbankruptcy or insolvency events involving the other party.\nIf the 2015 Co-Development Agreement is terminated by AstraZeneca for convenience or by Innate for\nAstraZeneca’s material breach, insolvency or a patent challenge by AstraZeneca, all licenses and rights\ngranted under the agreement terminate, however, upon any such termination, AstraZeneca would grant\nInnate an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license, with the right to grant sublicenses,\n207\nunder technology developed by AstraZeneca and incorporated into or necessary for the exploitation of\nlicensed products, except for certain manufacturing technology that would require a separate agreement.\nIf the 2015 Co-Development Agreement is terminated by AstraZeneca for Innate's material breach or\ninsolvency, AstraZeneca has the right to continue the agreement by providing written notice to us. If\nAstraZeneca provides Innate with such written notice, among other things, its rights under the co-promote\noption will terminate and the Company must cease any development, manufacture or commercialization\nactivities under the agreement.\nCollaboration and Option Agreement with AstraZeneca relating to CD39\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into a collaboration and option agreement relating to IPH5201.\nThe Company received an initial payment of $50 million under this agreement, $26 million of which was\nreceived in October 2018 and $24 million of which was received in January 2019. Pursuant to the 2018\nCD39 Option Agreement, the Company granted to AstraZeneca an exclusive option to obtain an\nexclusive license to certain of its patents and know-how to develop and commercialize licensed products,\nincluding IPH5201 in the field of the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of all diseases and conditions in\nhumans or animals, subject to certain limitations.\nUnder the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement, the Company must collaborate with AstraZeneca to develop\nCD39 option products. Prior to the expiration of the option period, the Company and AstraZeneca are\nsubject to certain non-compete obligations.\nAstraZeneca is responsible for funding the research and development costs of CD39 option products\ncontemplated in the joint development plan. Additionally, the Company may conduct certain exploratory\nclinical studies at its own cost, subject to reimbursement by AstraZeneca with a premium under certain\ncircumstances related to subsequent development by AstraZeneca.\nFollowing the dosing of the first patient on March 9, 2020 in the IPH5201 Phase 1 clinical trial,\nAstraZeneca made a $5 million milestone payment to Innate.\nIn June 2022, the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement was amended. Innate received a $5 million milestone\npayment from AstraZeneca upon signature of the amendment and is responsible for conducting a new\nPhase 2 multicenter, open label, non-randomized study of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with\nIPH5201, durvalumab and chemotherapy in patients with resectable, early-stage non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC). The \"MATISSE\" Study has started. AstraZeneca and Innate will share study costs and\nAstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs. Innate made a €0.6 million milestone payment to Orega\nBiotech SAS pursuant to Innate’s exclusive licensing agreement (see below).\nOn June 26, 2023, the Company announced the first patient was dosed in MATISSE, a Phase 2\nmulticenter single-arm study (NCT05742607), sponsored by the Company, evaluating neoadjuvant and\nadjuvant treatment with IPH5201, an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody, in combination with\ndurvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and chemotherapy, in treatment-naïve patients with resectable early stage non-\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary objectives of the study are to assess antitumor activity of\nneoadjuvant treatment based on pathological complete response (pCR) and safety. The Company is\nresponsible for conducting the study and shares study costs with AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca supplies\nclinical trial drugs. More information about the Phase 2 MATISSE trial, see “Item 4.B—Business\nOverview—IPH5201, an Anti-CD39 Antibody Targeting the Immunosuppressive Adenosine Pathway.”\nThe Company received a $5 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca when the decision was made to\nprogress IPH5201 to a Phase 2 clinical trial.\n208\nUnless earlier terminated, the term of the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement will expire on the earlier of\nexercise of the option or expiration of the option period in the event that AstraZeneca does not exercise\nthe option. The Company may terminate the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement if AstraZeneca challenges\nany option patent. AstraZeneca may terminate the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement in its entirety for\nconvenience at any time effective upon three months’ prior written notice to us. Either party may\nterminate the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party\nor for certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving the other party.\nCD39 Co-Development and License Agreement Upon Option Exercise by AstraZeneca\nUpon exercise of the option under the 2018 CD39 Option Agreement, the Company would enter into a\nco-development and license agreement with AstraZeneca, or the CD39 Potential License\nAgreement.Under the CD39 Potential License Agreement, the Company would grant to AstraZeneca a\nworldwide,exclusive license, subject to certain exclusions, to certain of its patents and know-how\nregarding, among other things, its IPH5201 candidate, to develop, manufacture and commercialize\nlicensed products in the field of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions in humans\nand in animals, subject to certain limitations. The Company would retain certain rights under the licensed\npatents and know-how to, among other things, co-promote licensed products in certain European\ncountries, pursuant to its option to co-promote.\nThe CD39 Potential License Agreement provides for a payment of $25 million upon exercise.\nAdditionally, AstraZeneca would be obligated to pay Innate up to $795 million in the aggregate upon the\nachievement of certain development and regulatory milestones ($295 million) and commercialization\nmilestones ($500 million). The arrangement also provides for a 50% profit share in Europe if the\nCompany opts into certain co-promoting and late stage co-funding obligations. In addition, the Company\nwould be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a high-single digit to mid-teen percentage on net\nsales of IPH5201, or from a mid-single digit to low-double digit percentage on net sales of other types of\nlicensed products, outside of Europe. The royalties payable to Innate under the CD39 Potential License\nAgreement may be reduced under certain circumstances, including loss of exclusivity or lack of patent\nprotection.\nUnder the CD39 Potential License Agreement, unless the Company has elected not to co-fund, the\nCompany would be required to collaborate with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize licensed\nproducts. AstraZeneca would be the lead party in developing and commercializing the licensed products\nand each party must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and\ncommercialize at least one licensed product in certain major markets.

As provided by the termination and\ntransition agreement, Innate paid $6.2 million to AstraZeneca on April 29, 2022. Transition of all\nLumoxiti rights back to AstraZeneca was completed in July 2022.\n210\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nDevelopment and License Agreement relating to monalizumab\nOn February 5, 2014, the Company in-licensed the full development and commercialization rights to\nmonalizumab from Novo Nordisk A/S. In consideration for these rights, the Company paid Novo Nordisk\nA/S €2 million in cash and 600,000 of its ordinary shares at a price of €8.33 per share. Novo Nordisk A/S\nis eligible to receive a total of €20 million in potential regulatory milestones and tiered mid-to-high\nsingle-digit percentage royalties on future net sales.\nThe agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S included a right to additional consideration in the event of an out-\nlicensing agreement. Consequently, following the agreement signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015, the\nCompany paid Novo Nordisk A/S an additional consideration amount of €6.5 million.\nIn October 2018 AstraZeneca exercised its option under the 2015 Option Agreement to acquire an\nexclusive license to monalizumab. Pursuant to this option exercise, AstraZeneca paid $100 million to\nInnate and, as a result, Novo Nordisk A/S became entitled to a second and final payment amounting to\n$15.0 million (€13.1 million). If the AstraZeneca agreement is terminated for any reason, the Company\nwill pay to Novo Nordisk A/S a portion of any amounts that have been budgeted but have not been spent\nor will not be spent under the initial research and development budget. In light of current development\nplans and research and development costs incurred to date, the Company does not currently expect any\namounts to be paid pursuant to this provision.\nLicense Agreement relating to avdoralimab\nIn July of 2017 the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S relating\nto avdoralimab, or the 2017 Novo Agreement, pursuant to which the Company obtained a worldwide,\nexclusive license under certain patents and know-how of Novo Nordisk A/S to develop, manufacture and\ncommercialize pharmaceutical products that contain or comprise an Anti-C5aR antibody.

As of\nDecember 31, 2018, the Company had paid a total amount of €1.8 million to Orega Biotech for the\nacquisition of these intellectual property rights, and in June 2019, the Company paid Orega Biotech €7.0\nmillion in relation to the anti-CD39 program as consideration relating to the collaboration and option\nagreement signed on October 22, 2018 with AstraZeneca for IPH5201. Following the dosing of the first\npatient on March 9, 2020 in the IPH5201 Phase 1 clinical trial, AstraZeneca made a $5 million milestone\npursuant to Innate’s collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca and Innate made a €2.5 million milestone\npayment in April 2020 and a €0.2 million milestone payment in June 2020 to Orega Biotech SAS\npursuant to its licensing agreement with Orega Biotech SAS. In June 2022, Innate received a $5 million\nmilestone payment from AstraZeneca upon signature of an amendment to the 2018 CD39 Option\n213\nAgreement (see above) and made a €0.6 million milestone payment to Orega Biotech SAS pursuant to its\nlicensing agreement with Orega Biotech SAS.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Company may also pay Orega Biotech up to an additional €48.8 million in\nthe aggregate upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Finally, the Company will\nbe required to pay a low-teen percentage of sub-licensing revenues received by the Company pursuant to\nits agreement with AstraZeneca regarding IPH5201.]\nTakeda\nLicense Agreement relating to development of antibody drug conjugates\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with\nTakeda under which the Company grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop\nantibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Company antibodies against an undisclosed\ntarget, with a primary focus in Celiac disease.\nTakeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and commercialization of any\npotential products developed using the licensed antibodies. Under the terms of the license agreement, the\nCompany will receive a $5 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $410 million in future\ndevelopment, regulatory and commercial milestones if all milestones are achieved during the term of the\nagreement, plus royalties on potential net sales of any commercial product resulting from the license.\nBank Loans\nOn July 17, 2017, the Company entered into one loan agreement with Société Générale, pursuant to\nwhich the Company obtained a financing in an amount equal to €15.2 million with a term of 12 years.\nOn December 22, and December 17, 2021, the Company entered into two loan agreements with Société\nGénérale and BNP Paribas, respectively, pursuant to which the Company obtained non-dilutive financing\nin an aggregate amount equal to €28.7 million.\nThe two loans have an initial term of one year with an extension up to five years at Innate’s option. They\nare 90% guaranteed by the French state (“PGE”) as part of the package of measures put in place by the\nFrench government to support companies during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn August 2022, the Company requested the extension of these two loans repayment for an additional\nperiod of five years starting in 2022 and including a one-year grace period (2023). Consequently, the\nCompany has obtained agreements from Société Générale and BNP Paribas. The effective interest rates\napplied to these contracts during the additional period are 1.56% and 0.95% for Société Générale and\nBNP Paribas loans, respectively, excluding insurance and guarantee fees, with an amortization exemption\nfor the entire year 2023. During this grace period, the Company was only liable for the payment of\ninterest and the guarantee fees, with amortization of the two loans starting in 2024 over a period of four\nyears.\nThe summaries provided above do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the complete agreements, which are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 20-F.\nFor additional information on its material contracts, please see “Item 4. Information on the Company,”\n“Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees,” and “Item 7.B. Related Party Transactions” of\nthis Annual Report on 20-F.\n214\nD. Exchange Controls.\nUnder current French foreign exchange regulations there are no restrictions on the amount of cash\ntransfers that may be made to residents of foreign countries (subject to the absence of any specific\ndecision taken by the government otherwise). Laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange controls\ndo, however, require that all payments or transfers of funds made by a French resident to a non-resident\nsuch as dividend payments be handled by an accredited intermediary. All registered banks and\nsubstantially all credit institutions in France are accredited intermediaries. For completeness, there is a\nreporting obligation to the custom officer for transfer of cash in banknotes and coins of €10,000 or more\ncarried into, or out of, the European Union.\nE. Taxation.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following describes material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who hold\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets. This summary does not address all U.S. federal income tax\nmatters that may be relevant to a particular U.S. holder, such as the effects of Section 451(b) of the Code.\nThis summary does not address tax considerations applicable to a holder of the ordinary shares or ADSs\nthat may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following:\n• banks, financial institutions or insurance companies;\n• brokers, dealers or traders in securities, currencies, commodities, or notional principal contracts;\n• tax-exempt entities or organizations, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA” as\ndefined in Section 408 or 408A of the Code (as defined below), respectively;\n• real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies or grantor trusts;\n• persons that hold the ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a “hedging,” “integrated,” “wash sale” or\n“conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• S corporations, partnerships, or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes;\n• certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;\n• persons that received the ordinary shares or ADSs as compensation for the performance of services;\n• persons acquiring the ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted\noutside of the United States, including a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France;\n• holders that own directly, indirectly, or through attribution 10% or more of the voting power or\nvalue of the ordinary shares or ADSs; and\n• holders that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar.\nHolders of the ordinary shares or ADSs who fall within one of the categories above are advised to consult\ntheir tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences which may apply to their particular situation.\nFor the purposes of this description, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of the ordinary shares or ADSs\nthat is (or is treated as), for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n215\n• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of\nthe United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia;\n• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n• a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its\nadministration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the substantial\ndecisions of such trust, or if such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury\nRegulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nIf a partnership (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes) holds the ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax consequences relating to an investment in the\nordinary shares or ADSs will depend in part upon the status of the partner and the activities of the\npartnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor regarding the specific tax\nconsiderations of acquiring, owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs in its particular\ncircumstances.\nPersons considering an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their own tax\nadvisors as to the particular tax consequences applicable to them relating to the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs, including the applicability of U.S.\nfederal, state and local tax laws, French tax laws and other non-U.S. tax laws.\nThis description does not address the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax considerations,\nthe Medicare tax on net investment income or any U.S. state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations of the\nacquisition, ownership and disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis description is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, existing,\nproposed and temporary U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and\njudicial interpretations thereof, in each case as of the date hereof. All the foregoing is subject to change,\nwhich change could apply retroactively, and to differing interpretations, all of which could affect the tax\nconsiderations described below. There can be no assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the\nIRS, will not take a position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and\ndisposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs or that such a position would not be sustained by a court. The\nCompany has not obtained, nor does the Company intend to obtain, a ruling with respect to the U.S.\nfederal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership or disposition of its ordinary shares or\nADSs. Accordingly, holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local\nand non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs in\ntheir particular circumstances.\nAs indicated below, this summary is subject to the discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax rules\napplicable to a “passive foreign investment company” (PFIC).\nIn general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.\nholder holding ADSs will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs.\nExchanges of ordinary shares for ADSs, and ADSs for ordinary shares, generally will not be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax.\nDistributions. Subject to the discussion under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,”\nbelow, the gross amount of any distribution (including any amounts withheld in respect of foreign tax)\nactually or constructively received by a U.S. holder with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will\ngenerally be taxable to the U.S. holder as a dividend to the extent of the U.S. holder’s pro rata share of the\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.\n216\nDistributions in excess of earnings and profits will generally be non-taxable to the U.S. holder to the\nextent of, and will be applied against and reduce, the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary\nshares or ADSs. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits and such adjusted tax basis will generally\nbe taxable to the U.S. holder as either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the\nU.S. holder has held the ordinary shares or ADSs for more than one year as of the time such distribution\nis received. However, since the Company does not calculate its earnings and profits under U.S. federal\nincome tax principles, it is expected that any distribution will be reported as a dividend, even if that\ndistribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules\ndescribed above. Non-corporate U.S. holders may qualify for the preferential rates of taxation with\nrespect to dividends on the ordinary shares or ADSs applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from\nthe sale of capital assets held for more than one year), or qualified dividend income if the Company is a\n“qualified foreign corporation” and certain other requirements are met. A non-U.S. corporation (other\nthan a corporation that is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding\ntaxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a) if it is eligible for the\nbenefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the\nUnited States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of\ninformation provision, or (b) with respect to any dividend it pays on ADSs which are readily tradable on\nan established securities market in the United States. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket, which is an established securities market in the United States, and the Company believes the\nADSs are readily tradable on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. There can be no assurance that the ADSs\nwill continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States in\nlater years. The Company, which is incorporated under the laws of France, believes that it qualifies as a\nresident of France for purposes of, and is eligible for the benefits of, the Convention between the\nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the\nAvoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income\nand Capital, signed on August 31, 1994, as amended and currently in force, or the U.S.-France Tax\nTreaty, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, the IRS has determined that the U.S.-\nFrance Tax Treaty is satisfactory for purposes of the qualified dividend rules and that it includes an\nexchange-of-information program. Therefore, subject to the discussion under “—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Considerations,” below, such dividends will generally be “qualified dividend\nincome” in the hands of individual U.S. holders, provided that a holding period requirement (more than\n60 days of ownership, without protection from the risk of loss, during the 121-day period beginning 60\ndays before the ex-dividend date) and certain other requirements are met. The dividends will not be\neligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. holders.\nSubject to applicable limitations and the Final FTC Treasury Regulations (as defined below), a U.S.\nholder generally may claim the amount of any French withholding tax on a distribution not exceeding the\nrate provided by the U.S.-France Tax Treaty (as defined below) as either a deduction from gross income\nor a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability. French taxes withheld in excess of the rate\napplicable with respect to such U.S. holder under the U.S.-France Tax Treaty will not be eligible for a\ncredit against a U.S. holder’s federal income tax liability. Treasury Regulations issued on December 28,\n2021, which apply to foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28,\n2021, or the Final FTC Treasury Regulations, impose additional requirements for foreign taxes to be\neligible for credit. However, the IRS has indicated that taxpayers may defer the application of many of\nthe additional requirements until further notice. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding\nthe availability of foreign tax credits for any amounts withheld with respect to dividends on ADSs or\nordinary shares, including under the Final FTC Treasury Regulations.\nThe foreign tax credit is subject to numerous complex limitations that must be determined and applied on\nan individual basis. Generally, the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. holder’s U.S.\n217\nfederal income tax liability that such U.S. holder’s taxable income bears to such U.S. holder’s worldwide\ntaxable income. In applying this limitation, dividends received generally will be treated as income from\nforeign sources and generally will be “passive category income,” or in certain cases “general category\nincome” or “foreign branch income,” which is treated separately from other types of income for purposes\nof computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders. In addition, the creditability of foreign taxes\ncould be affected by actions taken by intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holders of\nADSs or ordinary shares and the Company if, as a result of such actions, the holders of our ADSs or\nordinary shares are not properly treated as beneficial owners of the underlying ordinary shares. Each U.S.\nholder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the foreign tax credit rules.\nIn general, the amount of a distribution paid to a U.S. holder in a foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot exchange rate on the day the depositary\nreceives the distribution, in the case of the ADSs, or on the day the distribution is received by the U.S.\nholder, in the case of ordinary shares, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into U.S.\ndollars at that time. Any foreign currency gain or loss a U.S. holder realizes on a subsequent conversion\nof foreign currency into U.S. dollars will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends received in\na foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the day they are received, a U.S. holder should not\nbe required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend.\nSale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the ordinary\nshares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized from such sale or\nexchange and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in those ordinary shares or ADSs, each as determined in\nU.S. dollars. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds\nreceived on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs that are not paid in\nU.S. dollars. Subject to the discussion under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”\nbelow, this gain or loss will generally be a capital gain or loss. The adjusted tax basis in the ordinary\nshares or ADSs generally will be equal to the U.S dollar cost of such ordinary shares or ADSs. Capital\ngain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs by a non-\ncorporate U.S. holder is generally eligible for a preferential rate of taxation applicable to capital gains, if\nthe non-corporate U.S. holder’s holding period determined at the time of such sale, exchange or other\ntaxable disposition for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year (i.e., such gain is long-term\ntaxable gain). The deductibility of capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to\nlimitations. Any such gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes generally will be treated as U.S. source\ngain or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations. If the Company is a PFIC in any taxable year, a\nU.S. holder will be subject to special rules generally intended to reduce or eliminate any benefits from the\ndeferral of U.S. federal income tax that a U.S. holder could derive from investing in a non-U.S. company\nthat does not distribute all of its earnings on a current basis.\nThe Company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which, after\napplying certain look-through rules with respect to the income and assets of its subsidiaries, either: (1) at\nleast 75% of the gross income is “passive income” or (2) at least 50% of the average quarterly value of\nthe total gross assets (which would generally be measured by fair market value of its assets, and for which\npurpose the total value of its assets may be determined in part by the market value of the ADSs and its\nordinary shares, which are subject to change) is attributable to assets that produce “passive income” or are\nheld for the production of “passive income.”\nPassive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from\ncommodities and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets\n218\nwhich produce passive income, and includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of\nfunds raised in offerings of the ordinary shares or ADSs. If a non-U.S. corporation owns directly or\nindirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation or entity treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as\nowning its proportionate share of the assets of such entity and as receiving directly its proportionate share\nof the other entity’s income. The determination of whether the Company is a PFIC is a fact-intensive\ndetermination made on an annual basis, and the applicable law is subject to varying interpretation. If the\nCompany is a PFIC in any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owns its ordinary shares or ADSs,\nsuch U.S. holder will be subject to special tax rules discussed below and could suffer adverse tax\nconsequences.\nThe market value of the assets may be determined in large part by reference to the market price of the\nADSs and its ordinary shares. Therefore, fluctuations in the market price of the ordinary shares or ADSs\nmay result in the Company being a PFIC for any taxable year. Whether the Company is a PFIC for any\ntaxable year will depend on income, assets, activities and market capitalization in each year, and because\nthis is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance\nthat the Company will not be a PFIC in any taxable year. The Company does not believe it was\ncharacterized as a PFIC in its taxable year ended December 31, 2023. However, there can be no assurance\nthat the Company will not be a PFIC in the current year or for any future taxable year. Its U.S. counsel\nexpresses no opinion regarding its conclusions or its expectations regarding its PFIC status.\nIf the Company is a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. holder owns its ordinary shares or\nADSs, the Company will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. holder in all\nsucceeding years during which the U.S. holder owns the ordinary shares or ADSs, regardless of whether\nthe Company continue to meet the tests described above unless the Company ceases to be a PFIC and the\nU.S. holder has made a “deemed sale” election under the PFIC rules or is eligible to make and makes a\nmark-to-market election (as described below), with respect to all taxable years during such U.S. holder’s\nholding period in which the Company is a PFIC. If the “deemed sale” election is made, a U.S. holder will\nbe deemed to have sold the ordinary shares or ADSs the U.S. holder holds at their fair market value as of\nthe date of such deemed sale and any gain from such deemed sale would be subject to the rules described\nbelow. After the deemed sale election, so long as the Company does not become a PFIC in a subsequent\ntaxable year, the U.S. holder’s ordinary shares or ADSs with respect to which such election was made\nwill not be treated as shares in a PFIC and the U.S. holder will not be subject to the rules described below\nwith respect to any “excess distribution” the U.S. holder receives from the Company or any gain from an\nactual sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs. U.S. holders should consult their tax\nadvisors as to the possibility and consequences of making a deemed sale election if such election becomes\navailable.\nIf the Company is a PFIC, and you are a U.S. holder that does not make one of the elections described\nabove (and below in further detail), a special tax regime will apply to both (a) any “excess distribution”\nby the Company to you (generally, your ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than\n125% of the average annual distribution received by you in the shorter of the three preceding years or\nyour holding period for its ordinary shares or ADSs) and (b) any gain realized on the sale or other\ndisposition of its ordinary shares or ADSs. Under this regime, any excess distribution and realized gain\nwill be treated as ordinary income and will be subject to tax as if (a) the excess distribution or gain had\nbeen realized ratably over your holding period for the ordinary shares or ADSs, (b) the amount deemed\nrealized in each year had been subject to tax in each year of that holding period at the highest marginal\nrate for such year (other than income allocated to the current period or any taxable period before the\nCompany became a PFIC, which would be subject to tax at the U.S. holder’s regular ordinary income rate\nfor the current year and would not be subject to the interest charge discussed below), and (c) the interest\n219\ncharge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed to have been\npayable in those years. In addition, dividend distributions made to you will not qualify for the lower rates\nof taxation applicable to qualified dividends discussed above under “Distributions.”\nCertain elections may alleviate some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an\nalternative treatment of the ordinary shares or ADSs. If a U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election,\nthe U.S. holder generally will recognize as ordinary income any excess of the fair market value of the\nordinary shares or ADSs at the end of each taxable year over their adjusted tax basis, and will recognize\nan ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the ordinary shares or ADSs over\ntheir fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income\npreviously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S. holder makes the election, the\nU.S. holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss\namounts. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs in a year in\nwhich the Company is a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an\nordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the\nmark-to-market election). The mark-to-market election is available only if the Company is a PFIC and its\nordinary shares or ADSs are “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange.” Its ordinary shares or ADSs\nwill be treated as “regularly traded” in any calendar year in which more than a de minimis quantity of its\nordinary shares or ADSs are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar\nquarter (subject to the rule that trades that have as one of their principal purposes the meeting of the\ntrading requirement are disregarded). The Nasdaq Global Select Market is a qualified exchange for this\npurpose and, consequently, if the ADSs are regularly traded, the mark-to-market election will be available\nto a U.S. holder. It should be noted that only the ADSs and not its ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market. Consequently, its ordinary shares may not be marketable if Euronext Paris (where\nits ordinary shares are listed) does not meet the applicable requirements. U.S. holders should consult their\ntax advisors regarding the availability of the mark-to-market election for ordinary shares that are not\nrepresented by ADSs.\nHowever, a mark-to-market election generally cannot be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs\nthat the Company owns, unless shares of such lower-tier PFIC are themselves “marketable.” As a result,\neven if a U.S. holder validly makes a mark-to-market election with respect to its ordinary shares or ADSs,\nthe U.S. holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules (described above) with respect to its indirect\ninterest in any of its investments that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the availability and desirability of a\nmark-to-market election, as well as the impact of such election on interests in any lower-tier PFICs.\nThe Company does not currently intend to provide the information necessary for U.S. holders to make a\n“qualified electing fund election” if the Company is treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. U.S. holders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine whether this election would be available and if so, what the\nconsequences of the alternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances.\nIf the Company is a PFIC, the general tax treatment for U.S. holders described in this section would apply\nto indirect distributions and gains deemed to be realized by U.S. holders in respect of any of its\nsubsidiaries that also may be PFICs. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the PFIC rules to the Company's subsidiaries.\nIf a U.S. holder owns its ordinary shares or ADSs during any taxable year in which the Company is a\nPFIC, the U.S. holder generally will be required to file an IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a\nShareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund) with respect to the\nCompany, generally with the U.S. holder’s federal income tax return for that year. If the Company is a\n220\nPFIC for a given taxable year, then you should consult your tax advisor concerning your annual filing\nrequirements.\nThe U.S. federal income tax rules relating to PFICs are complex. Prospective U.S. investors are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs, the consequences to them of an investment in a PFIC, any elections\navailable with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs and the IRS information reporting\nobligations with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the ordinary shares or\nADSs.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting. U.S. holders generally will be subject to information\nreporting requirements with respect to dividends on the ordinary shares or ADSs and on the proceeds\nfrom the sale, exchange or disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs that are paid within the United\nStates or through U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the U.S. holder is an “exempt recipient.” In\naddition, U.S. holders may be subject to backup withholding on such payments, unless the U.S. holder\nprovides a taxpayer identification number and a duly executed IRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an\nexemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and the amount of any backup withholding will\nbe allowed as a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder\nto a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nForeign Asset Reporting. Certain individual U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an\ninterest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for shares\nheld in accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions) by filing IRS Form 8938 (Statement of\nSpecified Foreign Financial Assets) with their federal income tax return. U.S. holders are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding their information reporting obligations, if any, with respect to their ownership\nand disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A SUMMARY OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OR ADSs AND IS\nBASED UPON LAWS AND RELEVANT INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF IN EFFECT AS OF\nTHE DATE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE,\nPOSSIBLY WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED\nTO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN\nINVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OR ADSs IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S\nOWN CIRCUMSTANCES.\nMaterial French Tax Considerations\nThe following describes the material French income tax consequences to U.S. holders of purchasing,\nowning and disposing of ordinary shares or the ADSs.\nThis discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the\nacquisition, ownership or disposition of our ordinary shares or the ADSs to any particular investor, and\ndoes not discuss tax considerations that arise from rules of general application or that are generally\nassumed to be known by investors. All of the following is subject to change. Such changes could apply\nretroactively and could affect the consequences described below.\nFrench tax rules applicable to French assets that are held by or in foreign trusts generally provide inter\nalia for the inclusion of trust assets in the settlor’s net assets for the purpose of applying the French real\nestate wealth tax , for the application of French gift and estate tax to French assets held in trust, for a\nspecific tax on capital on the French assets of foreign trusts not already subject to the French real estate\nwealth tax and for a number of French tax reporting and disclosure obligations. The following discussion\n221\ndoes not address the French tax consequences applicable to securities (including ordinary shares or ADSs)\nheld in trusts. If our ordinary shares or ADSs are held in trust, the grantor, trustee and beneficiary are\nadvised to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and\ndisposing of such securities.\nThe description of the French income tax and real estate wealth tax consequences set forth below is based\non the double tax treaty entered into between the Government of the United States of America and the\nGovernment of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal\nEvasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital of August 31, 1994 (the “U.S.-France Tax\nTreaty”), which came into force on December 30, 1995 (as amended by any subsequent protocols,\nincluding the protocol of January 13, 2009), and the tax guidelines issued by the French tax authorities in\nforce as of the date of this Annual Report.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of securities that is\n(1) an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (2) a U.S.\ndomestic corporation or certain other entities created or organized in or under the laws of the United\nStates or any state thereof, or (3) otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis\nin respect of securities.\nIf a partnership holds ADSs, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership\ngenerally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or\npartnership is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring,\nowning and disposing of ADSs.\nThis discussion applies only to investors that hold ADSs as capital assets that are entitled to Treaty\nbenefits under the “Limitation on Benefits” provision contained in the U.S.-France Tax Treaty, and whose\nownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected to a permanent establishment or a\nfixed base in France. Certain U.S. Holders (including, but not limited to, U.S. expatriates, partnerships or\nother entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, banks, insurance companies,\nregulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, persons subject to the\nalternative minimum tax, persons who acquired the securities pursuant to the exercise of employee share\noptions or otherwise as compensation, persons that own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) 5% or more\nof our voting stock or 5% or more of our outstanding share capital, dealers in securities or currencies,\nbrokers, mutual funds, individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts persons that elect to mark their\nsecurities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes and persons holding securities as a position in a\nsynthetic security, straddle or conversion transaction) may be subject to special rules not discussed below,\nand are advised to consult their usual tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences which may\napply to their particular situation.\nU.S. Holders are advised to consult their own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the purchase,\nownership and disposition of securities in light of their particular circumstances, especially with regard to\nthe “Limitations on Benefits” provision contained in the U.S.-France Tax Treaty.\nTax on Sale or other Disposals\nAs a matter of principles, under French tax law subject to limited exemptions,and to the extent Innate is\nnot a real estate company for the purpose of Article 244 bis A of the French Tax Code (Code général des\nimpôts, the “FTC”), a U.S. Holder should not be subject to any French tax on any capital gain from the\nsale, exchange, repurchase or redemption by Innate of ordinary shares or ADSs, provided such U.S.\nHolder is not a French tax resident for French tax purposes and has not held more than 25% of the\ndividend rights, known as “droits aux bénéfices sociaux,” at any time during the preceding five years,\neither directly or indirectly, and, as relates to individuals, alone or with relatives it has not transferred\n222\nordinary shares or ADSs as part of redemption by Innate, in which case the proceeds may under certain\ncircumstances be partially or fully characterized as dividends under French domestic law and, as result, be\nsubject to French dividend withholding tax.\nAs an exception, a U.S. Holder resident, established or incorporated in certain non-cooperative States or\nterritories as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC should be subject to a 75% withholding tax in France\non any such capital gain, regardless of the fraction of the dividend rights it holds, subject to safe-harbor\nprovisions and the more favorable provisions of the U.S.-France Tax Treaty. The list of non-cooperative\nState or territory is published by decree and is in principle updated annually. This list was last updated on\n16 February 2024, and currently includes American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the\nBahamas, Belize, Fiji, Guam, Palaos, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turk\nand Caicos, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu. States referred to in Article 238-0 A, 2 bis-2°\nof the FTC, and thus outside of the scope of Article 244 bis B of the FTC, are currently American Samoa,\nFiji, Guam, Palaos, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands.\nUnder application of the U.S.-France Tax Treaty, a U.S. Holder who is a U.S. resident for purposes of the\nU.S.-France Tax Treaty and entitled to Treaty benefits will not be subject to French tax on such capital\ngain unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base that the U.S. Holder has in France. U.S. Holders who own ordinary shares or\nADSs through U.S. partnerships that are not resident for U.S.-France Tax Treaty purposes are advised to\nconsult their own tax advisor regarding their French tax treatment and their eligibility for Treaty benefits\nin light of their own particular circumstances.\nA U.S. Holder that is not a U.S. resident for U.S.-France Tax Treaty purposes or is not entitled to Treaty\nbenefits (and in both cases is not resident, established or incorporated in certain non-cooperative States or\nterritories as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC) and has held more than 25% of the dividend rights,\nknown as “droits aux bénéfices sociaux” at any time during the preceding five years, either directly or\nindirectly, and, as relates to individuals, alone or with relatives will be subject to a levy in France (i) at the\nrate of 12.8% for individuals, and (ii) 25% for legal persons. However, eligible non-French tax resident\nlegal entities may claim a refund of the 25% French levy to the extent such tax exceeds the amount that\nwould have been due under French corporate income tax if they had been French tax residents. This\nrefund mechanism is only available to certain legal entities. Non-French tax resident legal entities are\nadvised to consult their own tax adviser regarding their French tax treatment and their eligibility to this\nrefund mechanism.\nThe above French provisions expressly apply to sale, repurchase or redemption by us of ordinary shares.\nSpecial rules apply to U.S. Holders who are residents of more than one country.\nFinancial Transactions Tax\nPursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the FTC, purchases of shares or ADSs of a French company listed on a\nregulated market of the European Union or on a foreign regulated market formally acknowledged by the\nAMF are subject to a 0.3% French tax on financial transactions provided that the issuer’s market\ncapitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year. A list of\ncompanies whose market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the year preceding\nthe taxation year, within the meaning of Article 235 ter ZD of the FTC, is published annually by the\nFrench tax authorities in their official guidelines. As at December 1, 2023, the market capitalization did\nnot exceed 1 billion euros, pursuant to BOI-ANNX-000467-20/12/2023 issued on December 20, 2023.\nMoreover, Nasdaq Global Select Market, on which ADSs are listed, is not currently acknowledged by the\nAMF, but this may change in the future.\n223\nAs a consequence, neither the ADSs nor the ordinary shares are currently within the scope of the French\ntax on financial transactions.\nPurchases of our securities may be subject to such tax in the future provided that the market capitalization\nexceeds 1 billion euros in the year preceding the taxation year and that the Nasdaq Global Select Market\nis acknowledged by the French AMF.\nRegistration Duties\nIn the case where Article 235 ter ZD of the FTC is not applicable, transfers of shares issued by a French\ncompany which are listed on a regulated or organized market within the meaning of the French monetary\nand financial code (\"Code monétaire et financier\") are subject to uncapped registration duties at the rate\nof 0.1% if the transfer is evidenced by a written statement (“acte”) executed either in France or outside\nFrance. As ordinary shares of the company are listed on Euronext Paris, which is an organized market\nwithin the meaning of the French monetary code, their transfer should be subject to uncapped registration\nduties at the rate of 0.1% subject to the existence of a written statement (“acte”), and provided that Article\n235 ter ZD of the FTC is not applicable. Although there is no case law or official guidelines published by\nthe French tax authorities on this point, transfer of ADSs should remain outside of the scope of the\naforementioned 0.1% registration duties. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisor about\nthe possible application of the registration duty upon the transfer of ADSs.\nTaxation of Dividends\nDividends paid by a French corporation to non-residents of France are generally subject to French\nwithholding tax at a rate of (i) 25% for payment benefiting legal persons which are not French tax\nresidents, and (ii) 12.8% for payment benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents. Dividends\npaid by a French corporation in certain non-cooperative States or territories, as defined in Article 238-0 A\nof the FTC, will generally be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 75%. However, eligible U.S.\nHolders entitled to Treaty benefits under the “Limitation on Benefits” provision contained in the U.S.-\nFrance Tax Treaty who are U.S. residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the U.S.-France Tax\nTreaty, will not be subject to this 25% or 75% withholding tax rate, but may be subject to the withholding\ntax at a reduced rate (as described below).\nUnder the U.S.-France Tax Treaty, the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to an eligible\nU.S. Holder who is a U.S. resident as defined pursuant to the provisions of the U.S.-France Tax Treaty\nand whose ownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base that such U.S. Holder has in France, is generally reduced to 15%, or to 5% if\nsuch U.S. Holder is a corporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital of the\nissuer; such U.S. Holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in\nexcess of the U.S.-France Tax Treaty rates of 15% or 5%, if any.\nFor U.S. Holders that are not individuals but are U.S. residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of\nthe U.S.-France Tax Treaty, the requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5%\nor 15% withholding tax rates contained in the “Limitation on Benefits” provision of the U.S.-France Tax\nTreaty, are complex, and certain technical changes were made to these requirements by the protocol of\nJanuary 13, 2009. U.S. Holders are advised to consult their own tax advisor regarding their eligibility for\nTreaty benefits in light of their own particular circumstances.\nDividends paid to an eligible U.S. Holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15%\nprovided that:\n• such holder establishes before the date of payment that it is a U.S. resident under the U.S.-France\nTax Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with a treaty form (Form 5000) in\n224\naccordance with French guidelines (BOI-INT-DG-20-20-20-20-12/09/2012 dated September 12,\n2012); or\n• the depositary or other financial institution managing the securities account in the U.S. of such\nholder provides the French paying agent with a document listing certain information about the U.S.\nHolder and its ordinary shares or ADSs and a certificate whereby the financial institution managing\nthe U.S. Holder’s securities account in the United States takes full responsibility for the accuracy of\nthe information provided in the document.\nOtherwise, dividends paid to a U.S. Holder, if such U.S. Holder is a legal person, will be subject to\nFrench withholding tax at the rate of 25%, or 75% if paid in certain non-cooperative States or territories\n(as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC), and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that\nsuch holder duly completes and provides the French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 and\nForm 5001 (due to recent case law regarding status of limitation for filing a withholding tax claim; U.S.\nHolders are advised to consult their own tax advisors in this respect).\nCertain qualifying pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities and certain U.S. residents may be\nsubject to specific filing requirements. They are advised to consult their own tax advisors on this point.\nForm 5000 and Form 5001, together with instructions, will be provided by the depositary to all U.S.\nHolders registered with the depositary. The depositary will arrange for the filing with the French tax\nauthorities of all such forms properly completed and executed by U.S. Holders of ordinary shares or\nADSs and returned to the depositary in sufficient time so that they may be filed with the French tax\nauthorities before the distribution in order to immediately obtain a reduced withholding tax rate.\nOtherwise, the depositary must withhold tax at the full rate of 25% or 75% as applicable. In that case, the\nU.S. Holders may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the excess withholding tax.\nIn any case, individual taxpayers who are not fiscally domiciled in France should not have to comply with\nthese procedures if the French withholding tax applying to them is lower than 15%.\nIn particular, since the withholding tax rate applicable under French domestic law to U.S. Holders who\nare individuals does not exceed the cap provided in the U.S.-France Tax Treaty (i.e., 15%), the 12.8% rate\nshall apply, without any reduction provided under the U.S.-France Tax Treaty (except in the particular\nsituation when the dividends are paid to such U.S. Holders out of France in a non-cooperative State or\nterritory as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same\nArticle 238-0 A of the FTC and are subject to the 75% withholding tax in France).\nBesides, please note that pursuant to Article 235 quater of the FTC (introduced by the French finance bill\nNo. 2019-1479 for 2020) and under certain conditions (in particular, in addition to certain reporting\nobligations, the interest held in the distributing company must not enable the beneficiary to participate\neffectively in the management or control of that company and the beneficiary company is located in a\ncountry that has signed an administrative assistance agreement with France to combat tax evasion and\navoidance, as well as an administrative assistance agreement on tax collection, and that is not a non-\ncooperative country), a corporate U.S. Holder which is in a tax loss position or which tax result is nil due\nto offset of tax losses (French Administrative Supreme Court, October 18, 2022, n° 466329) for the fiscal\nyear during which the dividend is received may be entitled to a deferral regime, and obtain a withholding\ntax refund. The tax deferral ends in respect of the first financial year during which this U.S. Holder is in a\nprofit making position, as well as in the cases set out in Article 235 quater of the FTC. The refund must\nbe claimed within the same period applicable to claim related to taxes other than local taxes. Also,\npursuant to Article 235 quinquies of the FTC and under certain conditions, a corporate U.S. Holder may\nbe entitled to a refund of a fraction of the withholding tax, up to the difference between the withholding\ntax paid (on a gross basis) and the withholding tax based on the dividend net of the expenses incurred for\n225\nthe acquisition and conservation directly related to the income, provided (i) that these expenses would\nhave been tax deductible had the U.S. Holder been established in France, and (ii) that the tax rules in the\nUnited States do not allow the U.S. Holder to offset the withholding tax.\nEstate and Gift Taxes\nIn general, a transfer of securities by gift or by reason of death of a U.S. Holder that would otherwise be\nsubject to French gift or inheritance tax, respectively, will not be subject to such French tax by reason of\nthe double tax treaty entered into between the Government of the United States of America and the\nGovernment of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal\nEvasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances and Gifts, dated November 24, 1978 (as amended\nfrom time to time), unless (i) the donor or the transferor is domiciled in France at the time of making the\ngift or at the time of his or her death, or (ii) the securities were used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a\nbusiness through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France.\nReal Estate Wealth Tax\nAs from January 1, 2018, the French wealth tax (impôt de solidarité sur la fortune) is repealed and\nreplaced by the French real estate wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune immobilière or IFI). The scope of such\nnew tax is narrowed to French real estate assets (and certain assets deemed to be real estate assets) or\nrights, held directly or indirectly through one or more legal entities and whose net taxable assets amount\nat least to €1,300,000.\nBroadly, subject to provisions of double tax treaties and to certain exceptions, individuals who are not\nresidents of France for tax purposes within the meaning of Article 4 B of the FTC are subject to the IFI in\nFrance in respect of the portion of the value of their shares of the company representing real estate assets\n(Article 965, 2° of the FTC). Some exceptions are provided by the FTC. In particular, Innate’s ordinary\nshares or ADSs owned by a U.S. Holder should not fall within the scope of the IFI provided that such\nU.S. Holder does not own (together with the members of his/her household) directly or indirectly a\nshareholding exceeding 10% of the financial rights and voting rights of Innate. U.S. Holders holding\ndirectly or indirectly a shareholding exceeding 10% of the financial rights and voting rights of Innate\nshould seek additional advice.\nUnder the U.S.-France Tax Treaty (the provisions of which should be applicable to this IFI in France), the\nIFI will however generally not apply to securities held by an eligible U.S. Holder who is a U.S. resident,\nas defined pursuant to the provisions of the U.S.-France Tax Treaty, provided that such U.S. Holder (i)\ndoes not own directly or indirectly more than 25% of the issuer’s financial rights and (ii) that the ADSs\ndo not form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base in France.\nU.S. Holders are advised to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences which\nmay apply to their particular situation with respect to such IFI.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents.\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts.\nNot applicable.\nH. Documents on Display.\nThe Company is subject to the information reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) applicable to foreign private issuers and under those\nrequirements will file reports with the SEC. Those reports may be inspected without charge at the\n226\nlocations described below. As a foreign private issuer, the Company is exempt from the rules under the\nExchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and its officers, directors and\nprincipal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained\nin Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Company is not required under the Exchange Act to\nfile periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States\ncompanies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. Nevertheless, the Company will file\nwith the SEC an Annual Report on Form 20-F containing financial statements that have been examined\nand reported on, with an opinion expressed by an independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Company maintains a corporate website at www.innate-pharma.com. The Company intends to post\nits Annual Report on Form 20-F on its website promptly following it being filed with the SEC.\nInformation contained on, or that can be accessed through, its website does not constitute a part of this\nAnnual Report. The Company has included its website address in this Annual Report solely as an inactive\ntextual reference.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy\nand information statements and other information regarding registrants, such as us, that file electronically\nwith the SEC.\nWith respect to references made in this Annual Report to any contract or other document of the Company,\nsuch references are not necessarily complete and you should refer to the exhibits attached or incorporated\nby reference to this Annual Report for copies of the actual contract or document.\nI. Subsidiary Information.\nNot required.\nJ. Annual Report to Security Holders\nTo the extent we furnish an annual report to security holders, we will promptly submit an English version\nof this annual report to U.S. security holders under the cover of Form 6-K.\nItem 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company's activities are exposed to liquidity risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk\nand credit risk.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Company does not believe that it is exposed to short-term liquidity risk, considering its cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments of €92.5 million as of December 31, 2023, which consist\nprimarily of cash and money market funds and term deposits, are convertible into cash immediately\nwithout penalty.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk inherent in certain subcontracting activities related to\nits operations in the United States, which are invoiced in U.S. dollars. The Company does not currently\nhave material recurring revenues in euro, dollars or in any other currency. As the Company further\nincreases its business, particularly in the United States, the Company expects to face greater exposure to\nexchange rate risk.\nInnate's revenue denominated in U.S. dollars has represented approximately 78%, 92% and 29% of\nrevenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Payments in U.S. dollars\nrepresented approximately 50%, 50%, and 43% of the payments in the years ended December 31, 2021,\n227\n2022 and 2023, respectively. In order to cover this foreign currency exchange rate risk, the Company kept\nin U.S. dollars a part of the consideration received from AstraZeneca in June 2015, January 2019 and\nSeptember 2020. The Company kept the entire U.S dollars portion of the proceeds received from its\nOctober 2019 global offering in U.S dollars. The Company does not use hedging instruments in its current\noperations. Refer to Item 3.D. Risk Factors - Innate's business may be exposed to foreign exchange risks.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company has limited exposure to interest rate risk. Its exposure primarily relates to money market\nfunds and time deposit accounts. Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the rate of return on\nthese investments and the cash flows generated. The Company does not have any credit facilities bearing\nvariable interest rates. The repayment of the advances from BPI France, the borrowings subscribed in\n2017 and the two State Guaranteed Loans obtained in 2021 and extended in 2022, are not subject to\ninterest rate risk. The effect of an increase or decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on\nprofit or loss.\nCredit risk\nThe credit risk related to the cash equivalents, short-term investments and non-current financial assets is\nnot significant in light of the quality of the issuers. The Company deemed that no instrument of its\nportfolio is exposed to credit risk.\n228\nItem 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities.\nA. Debt Securities.\nNot applicable.\nB. Warrants and Rights.\nNot applicable.\nC. Other Securities.\nNot applicable.\nD. American Depositary Shares.\nCitibank, N.A. (\"Citibank\") acts as the depositary bank for the ADSs. Citibank’s depositary offices are\nlocated at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. ADSs represent ownership interests in\nsecurities that are on deposit with the depositary bank. ADSs may be represented by certificates that are\ncommonly known as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Each ADS represents one ordinary share (or\nthe right to receive one ordinary share). The depositary bank typically appoints a custodian to safekeep\nthe securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank Europe plc, 1 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1,\nIreland.\nThe Company has appointed Citibank, N.A. as depositary bank pursuant to a deposit agreement. A copy\nof the deposit agreement has been filed with the SEC under cover of a Registration Statement on Form\nF-6 (Registration No. 333-234063). You may obtain a copy of the deposit agreement from the SEC’s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov.\nFor additional information on our ADSs, please refer to Exhibit 2.3 “Description of Securities Other

as\ndetermined by an expert. The BSAAR subscription therefore represents an investment on the part of the\nbeneficiary. At the end of the exercise period, if they have not been exercised, the BSAAR becomes void.\nThe Company benefits from a clause called «forcing» making it possible to encourage holders to exercise\ntheir redeemable equity warrants when the market price exceeds the exercise price and reaches a threshold\ndefined in the BSAAR issuance agreement. The Company may, then, subject to a time period for\nnotifying holders that will permit them to exercise the BSAAR, decide to reimburse the warrants not\nexercised at a unit price equal to the BSAAR acquisition price paid by its holder.\nDetails of BSAAR\nBSAAR. The methodology used to estimate the fair value of the BSAAR is similar to the one used to\nestimate the fair value of the BSA, except for the following:\nExpected Term. Unlike the BSA, the Company does not have sufficient historical experience for the\nBSAAR. Consequently, the expected term used for the valuation of the fair value is the legal maturity of\nthe instrument (10 years).\nNo share-based payment compensation expense was recognized relating to the BSAAR since the amount\npaid by the beneficiaries is equal to the fair value.\nBSAAR 2015\nDate of grant (Board of directors) July 1, 2015\nVesting period (years) 2 years\nPlan expiration date

Revenue recognition related to monalizumab AstraZeneca agreements and amendments\nThe Company identified the following promises under the monalizumab AstraZeneca agreements and\namendments: (1) a non-exclusive license related to monalizumab restricted to two applications, with an\noption for an exclusive license related to monalizumab including all applications, (2) the performance of\ncertain initial studies related to Phases 1/2 trials, and participation in certain studies of Phases 1/2 trials\nand Phase 3 clinical trials through a co-financing.\nThe Company considered the license has a standalone functionality and is capable of being distinct.\nHowever the Company determined that the license is not distinct from the performance of initial studies\nand participation to Phase 3 clinical trials because they increased the utility of the licensed IP. Thus, the\nlicensed IP, the performance of initial studies and participation to Phase 3 clinical trials are combined into\na single performance obligation.\nThis performance obligation was considered as satisfied over time as AstraZeneca controls the licensed IP\nwhich is being enhanced during the agreement. The revenue is recognized over time, based on the input\nmethod (costs incurred). As a result, the Company recognizes the price of the transaction as a revenue on\nthe basis of the progress of studies that the Company has undertaken to carry out under the agreement.\nF-68\nProgression is assessed following to actual costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs to fulfill the\nobligation.\nThe transaction price was initially estimated to the initial payment of $250,000 thousand, less the amounts\nthat the Company expected to pay to AstraZeneca for co-financing Phase 1/2 clinical studies. The\nadditional payment of $100,000 thousand triggered by AstraZeneca’s exercise of the exclusivity option\nwas treated as a change in the price estimate of the transaction. In addition, the amendment of the\ncontract, which modified the scope and budget of the studies to be carried out by the Company as well as\nthe arrangements for sharing the cost of the other studies, led to a revision of the degree of progress and\nthe price of the transaction. Thus, the exercise of the option and the amendment of the contract resulted in\nthe recognition of a favourable cumulative adjustment of €38,321 thousand in revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\nThe additional payment of $50,000 thousand triggered by the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 trial\nevaluating monalizumab was treated in full as a collaboration commitment (\"collaboration liability\" in the\nconsolidated balance sheet) in view to the commitment linked to the contract for the Phase 1/2 (co-\nfinancing) and Phase 3 studies (amendment signed in September 2020). Consequently, this additional\npayment has no impact on the transaction price.\nIn addition to these amounts, AstraZeneca made an additional payment of $50.0 million (€47.7 million) in\nJune 2022 and triggered by the treatment of the first patient in a second Phase 3 trial “PACIFIC-9”\nevaluating monalizumab in April 2022. This additional payment has been treated as an increase of the\ncollaboration commitment (\"collaboration liabilities\" in the consolidated statements of financial position)\nfor an amount of $36.0 million (€34.3 million) in connection to the Phase 3 study co-funding commitment\nmade by the Company and notified to AstraZeneca in July 2019. The remaining amount of $14.0 million\n(€13.4 million) has been treated as an increase of the transaction price, recognized in the income\nstatement in line with the progress of the Phase 1/2 studies.\nThe subsequent milestones and potential royalty payments are excluded from the transaction price due to\nthe uncertainties of clinical trials results.\nThe Company used the most likely amount to determine variable consideration. Variable consideration\nfor cost-sharing payments related to certain studies of Phases 1/2 trials and Phase 3 clinical trials when\napplicable are included in the transaction price.\nAs a reminder, the expected payments to AstraZeneca are classified as collaboration liability in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position. Quarterly invoices received from AstraZeneca reduce the\ncollaboration liability and have no impact on the consolidated statement of income.\nF-69\nChange in monalizumab deferred revenue (in thousands of euro):\nAs of December 31, 2020 26,572\nRevenue for the 2021 financial year (7,497)\nTransfer from collaboration liabilities 1,084\nAs of December 31, 2021 20,159\nIncrease in deffered revenu resulting from the $50m milestone relating to the dosage of the first\n47,687\npatent in the Phase 3 trial PACIFIC-9\nRevenue for the 2022 financial year (22,376)\nTransfer from collaboration liabilities (30,989)\nAs of December 31, 2022 14,481\nRevenue for the 2023 financial year (9,499)\nTransfer from collaboration liabilities 173\nAs of December 31, 2023 5,156\n(1) As a reminder, the increase in deferred revenue relating to monalizumab agreement between\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 is explained by the additional payment of €47,687 thousand\n($50,000 thousand) made by AstraZeneca in June 2022 and triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9”\nPhase 3 trial on April 28, 2022. This increase has led to a simultaneous increase in collaboration\ncommitment (\"collaboration liability\"- see below) of €34,335 thousand ($36,000 thousand) in accordance\nwith the Company’s July 2019 option concerning the co-financing of Phase 3 trials in the field of\ncollaboration.\nChange in monalizumab collaboration liablities (in thousands of euro):\nAs of December 31, 2020 (1) 46,686\nAdditions 4,262\nDeductions (10,534)\nAs of December 31, 2021 (2) 40,415\nAdditions (3) 37,564\nDeductions (14,768)\nAs of December 31, 2022 (4) 63,211\nAdditions —\nDeductions (10,534)\nAs of December 31, 2023 (5) 52,677\n(1) Of which €1,832 thousand of current portion and €44,854 of non-current portion.\n(2) Of which €7,418 of current portion and €32,997 of non-current portion.\n(3) The increase in collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab agreement between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 mainly\nresults from (i) a €34,335 thousand ($36,000 thousand) increase in collaboration commitments in connection with the launch of the\n“PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28, 2022, and (ii) a €2,145 thousand net increase in the collaboration commitments in connection with\nexchange rate fluctuations over the period.\n(4) Of which €10,223 thousand of current portion and €52,988 thousand of non-current portion.\n(5) Of which €7,647 thousand of current portion and €45,030 thousand of non-current portion.\nb) Revenue recognition related to IPH5201 AstraZeneca collaboration and option agreement\nRevenue related to IPH5201 for the year ended December 31, 2023 is nil as compared to revenue of\n€4,677 thousand as of December 31, 2022 which resulted from the entire recognition in revenue of the\n$5.0 million (€4.7 million) milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June\nF-70\n1, 2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. This amendment sets the terms of\nthe collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The\nCompany will conduct the study. Both parties will share the external cost related to the study and incurred\nby the Company and AstraZeneca will provide products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.\nc) Revenue recognition related to collaboration and license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016\nRevenues under the collaboration and license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 amounted to €2,000\nthousand for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to €4,000 thousand for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company announced that, in June 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-\nsponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in relapsed or refractory Multiple\nMyeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016, Sanofi made a milestone payment of\n€2.0 million, fully recognized in revenue since June 2023. This amount was received by the Company on\nJuly 21, 2023. As a reminder, the revenue recognized in 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance\nIPH6401/SAR'514 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug. This decision\ntriggered a milestone payment of €3.0 million fully recognized in revenue. This amount was received by\nthe Company on September 9, 2022.\nd) Revenue recognition related to Sanofi research collaboration and licensing agreement (2022)\nOn January 25, 2023, the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-\nRodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of\nJanuary 24, 2023. Consequently, under the terms of such agreement, the Company received an upfront\npayment of €25,000 thousand in March 2023, including €18,500 thousand for the exclusive license,\n€1,500 thousand for the research work and €5,000 thousand for the two additional targets options. On\nDecember 19, 2023, the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised an option for a one of the two\npreclinical molecules. This option exercise also resulted in a milestone payment of €15,000 thousand,\nincluding €13,300 thousand in respect of the exclusive license, which was fully recognized in income as\nof December 31, 2023, and €1,700 thousand in respect of research work to be carried out by the\nCompany. The Company considers that the licenses granted constitute a right to use the intellectual\nproperty granted exclusively to Sanofi from the effective date of the agreement. As such, all upfront\npayments relating to the licenses granted have been recognized in the income statement representing an\namount of €31,800 thousand, including €18,500 thousand relating to the B7-H3 license and €13,300\nthousand following the option exercised.\ne) Revenue recognition related to Takeda licensing agreement (2023)\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with\nTakeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody\ndrug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a\nprimary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and\ncommercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such, the\nCompany considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property, which is granted\nfully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly\naffect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently, the $5.0 million (or\n€4.6 million) initial payment, received by the Company in May 2023, was fully recognized in revenue\nsince June 30, 2023.
