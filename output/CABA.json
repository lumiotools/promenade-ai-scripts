(Nasdaq: CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases, today announced new and updated clinical data on CABA-201 demonstrating the potential to achieve drug-free, compelling clinical responses based on eight patients dosed across the ongoing Phase 1/2 RESET-Myositis™, RESET-SLE™ and RESET-SSc™ clinical trials. These data were presented in oral and poster presentations at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024, which is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. from November 14-19, 2024. Presentation materials featured at ACR Convergence 2024 can be accessed on the Company’s website [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NuB6bQJy6vE4R3OJFuE3vuxsoEvSwrwTyUPI4fvYmIBT0fvL012yVTAn9S9Yo8LyN19qNwjGHz6igro953l94X3M59TLKikZQzitchedLPtNyy589YOrDdQygeY7PaRT).\n\n“The clinical data reported at ACR Convergence this weekend support the potential of the current dose of CABA-201 to provide immunosuppressant-free, compelling clinical responses in patients with active, refractory autoimmune disease. Data presented from the previously reported patient with lupus nephritis who experienced ICANS and had acute inflammatory events shortly before CABA-201 treatment demonstrated an abnormal, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile prior to and after CABA-201 infusion, suggestive of an occult infection. As a result of these data, subjects in the RESET clinical program who develop a fever prior to scheduled infusion will wait a minimum of two weeks before administration of CABA-201. Other than this patient with a second, later peak expansion, CABA-201 displayed a consistent PK and PD profile in all other patients,” said David J. Chang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Cabaletta. “In addition to our promising clinical and translational data set from the RESET program, we believe our efficient clinical trial design, growing footprint of 40 actively recruiting U.S. clinical sites and anticipated expansion into Europe in 2025 provide us with a differentiated opportunity to accelerate development of CABA-201 for patients. Data permitting, we anticipate meeting with the FDA in 2025 to discuss potential registrational trial designs for CABA-201 that will allow us to bring the therapeutic potential of this investigational therapy closer to autoimmune patients.”\n\nCabaletta designed CABA-201, a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy, to deeply and transiently deplete CD19-positive B cells following a one-time infusion that may enable a reset of the immune system with the potential for durable remission without chronic immunosuppressive therapies in patients with autoimmune diseases. Cabaletta is currently evaluating CABA-201 in the RESET clinical development program across five company-sponsored clinical trials that each have disease-specific cohorts with six patients per cohort. All cohorts are evaluating the same single, weight-based dose of CABA-201 at 1 x 106 cells/kg without a dose escalation requirement. Treatment with CABA-201 in each clinical trial includes a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, consistent with the dosing regimen used in the third-party academic studies, except for the RESET-PV™ trial which is evaluating CABA-201 without preconditioning.\n\n**New and Updated Clinical Data Summary**\n\nAs of the data cut-off date of November 1, 2024, eight patients had been dosed with CABA-201 with sufficient follow-up to be evaluable across the RESET clinical development program. In the RESET-Myositis trial, one patient in the immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) cohort completed six months of follow-up and two patients, one in the IMNM cohort and one in the dermatomyositis (DM) cohort, each completed one month of follow-up. In the RESET-SLE trial, one patient in the non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort completed six months of follow-up, one patient in the lupus nephritis (LN) cohort completed four months of follow-up and two patients in the non-renal SLE cohort each completed one month of follow-up. Translational assessments from the third patient in the non-renal SLE cohort were not available for inclusion at the time of the data cut-off. In the RESET-SSc trial, one patient in the severe skin cohort completed six weeks of follow-up.\n\nAcross these eight patients treated with CABA-201, patients were administered a one-time infusion of CABA-201 at 1 x 106 cells/kg, following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The primary endpoint of each trial is safety and tolerability within 28 days of infusion. Secondary endpoints include translational assessments and clinical outcomes.\n\n**Safety and Tolerability Profile:****CABA-201 has shown a favorable risk-benefit profile in patients with active and refractory autoimmune disease**\n\n  * Through 28 days of follow-up, no evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of any grade was observed in five of the eight patients. Low-grade CRS (Grades 1-2) was observed in three patients, all of which recovered following standard care. Tocilizumab was not administered for any cases of CRS.\n  * No evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) of any grade has been observed in any patient since reporting the initial safety data on the first LN patient in August 2024. This patient had acute inflammatory events shortly before CABA-201 treatment and demonstrated an abnormal, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile prior to infusion that continued after CABA-201 infusion, suggestive of a possible occult infection.\n\n\n\n**Translational Assessments:****CABA-201 induced consistent and complete B cell depletion, with early naïve B cell repopulation suggesting the potential to generate an immune system reset**\n\n  * CAR T cell expansion associated with CABA-201 reached its peak between day 8 and day 15. Translational assessments from the first patient in the LN cohort indicated a second peak at day 29.\n  * Complete B cell depletion was observed by day 22 after CABA-201 infusion.\n  * B cell repopulation occurred in the first two patients treated with CABA-201 as early as 8 weeks and exhibited a transitional naïve phenotype, reflecting the production of new B cells after deep systemic depletion.\n  * Two of the three patients with follow-up beyond three months demonstrated a reduction in disease-associated antibodies. Clinical responses in all three of these patients were observed independent of autoantibody levels.\n  * Vaccine and infectious pathogen antibodies remained generally stable. \n\n\n\n**Clinical Outcomes:****CABA-201 provided compelling signs of early efficacy, supporting the potential for drug-free clinical responses**\n\n  * Initial clinical responses in the RESET-Myositis trial were consistent with published data with response kinetics appearing to differ between myositis subtypes. \n    * The first known adult DM patient dosed with CAR T in the form of CABA-201 demonstrated an improvement in muscle strength to normal and a major total improvement score (TIS) response off all immunosuppressants at one month of follow-up. The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index – Activity (CDASI-A) improved from 25 to 9.\n    * At six months of follow-up, the first IMNM patient demonstrated a continued and improved clinical response off immunosuppressants and without flares. At one month of follow-up, the second IMNM patient demonstrated a total improvement score consistent with the first IMNM patient at one month after CABA-201 infusion off immunosuppressants.\n  * All four patients in the RESET-SLE trial demonstrated clinical responses off immunosuppressants. \n    * All three patients in the non-renal SLE cohort demonstrated no clinical symptoms on SLEDAI-2K as of the latest follow-up and the first patient has completed a prednisone taper to discontinuation.\n    * The first patient in the LN cohort, who experienced the previously reported ICANS event, had a SLEDAI that improved from 22 at baseline to 8 at month four of follow-up. The patient’s proteinuria improved more than 90%, approaching normal levels, while off all immunosuppressants and with an ongoing prednisone taper.\n  * The first patient in the severe skin cohort in the RESET-SSc trial demonstrated early clinical improvements after discontinuation of disease-specific therapy. \n    * The modified Rodnan Skin Score of the first patient in the severe skin cohort improved from 42 at baseline (potential maximum of 51) to 36 at day 42, suggesting the potential emergence of a drug-free clinical response.\n\n\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast Information** Cabaletta will host a conference call and webcast today, November 18, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to review the new and updated clinical data presented at ACR Convergence 2024 and provide an update on the RESET clinical development program. A webcast of the live call can be accessed [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NuB6bQJy6vE4R3OJFuE3vkt--1bMavrlcJEXUN9SndiaIyI7lZyPGstkkrbtgVRaPhHGQ7QFVCvhD3A-JCNQWuandngbHcyUnNeaeuhg7s8=) or on the News and Events section of the Company’s website at [www.cabalettabio.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ycKV_D7XynjxgLeEjiTxFq0yPynBQVHJC40kyih7H-V2sPV5deNVGcAQQj-3DEz3gqpMzYvL46IdSQrg5dZNG-FdaKqxgyBQSwh0JJOC2_c=). An archived replay will be available on the Company’s website.\n\n**About the RESET-Myositis™ Trial** The RESET-Myositis™ trial is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of CABA-201 in subjects with active idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM, or myositis), including the subtypes of dermatomyositis (DM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) and juvenile myositis (JM), each evaluated in individual cohorts. Subjects will receive a one-time infusion of CABA-201 at a dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg, following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Key inclusion criteria for the DM, ASyS and IMNM cohorts include patients between ages 18 to 75 (inclusive), evidence of active disease and disease activity despite prior or current treatment with standard of care treatments. Key exclusion criteria for the DM, ASyS and IMNM cohorts include cancer-associated myositis, significant lung or cardiac impairment, treatment with a B cell depleting agent within the prior approximately six months or treatment with a biologic agent within the prior approximately three months.\n\n**About the RESET-SLE™ Trial** The RESET-SLE™ trial is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of CABA-201 in subjects with non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), each evaluated in individual cohorts. Subjects will receive a one-time infusion of CABA-201 at a dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg, following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Key inclusion criteria include patients between ages 18 to 65 (inclusive), evidence of active disease and disease activity despite prior or current treatment with standard of care treatments. Key exclusion criteria include treatment with a B cell depleting agent within the prior approximately six months or treatment with a biologic agent within the prior approximately three months.\n\n**About the RESET-SSc™ Trial** The RESET-SSc™ trial is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of CABA-201 in subjects with systemic sclerosis (SSc), including the subtypes of severe skin involvement and organ involvement regardless of skin involvement, each evaluated in individual cohorts. Subjects will receive a one-time infusion of CABA-201 at a dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg, following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Key inclusion criteria include patients between ages 18 and 70 (inclusive), evidence of significant skin, pulmonary, renal or cardiac involvement and significant organ involvement despite use of immunosuppressants. Key exclusion criteria include a primary diagnosis of another rheumatic autoimmune disease, treatment with a B cell depleting agent within the prior approximately six months or treatment with a biologic agent within the prior approximately three months.\n\n**About CABA-201** CABA-201 is a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy for patients with autoimmune diseases where B cells contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of disease. Following a one-time infusion, CABA-201 is designed to transiently and completely deplete all CD19-positive cells. This approach has the potential to reset the immune system and result in compelling clinical responses without chronic therapy requirements in patients. Cabaletta is currently evaluating CABA-201 in the RESET™ (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program which includes multiple disease-specific, company-sponsored clinical trials across growing portfolios of autoimmune diseases in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology.\n\n**About Cabaletta Bio** Cabaletta Bio (Nasdaq: CABA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases.

(Nasdaq: CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“Focused clinical execution has resulted in 40 U.S. clinical sites actively recruiting patients for the RESET clinical trial program for CABA-201. At the ACR Convergence conference this coming weekend, we are looking forward to sharing clinical safety and efficacy data from the first 8 myositis, lupus and scleroderma patients in the RESET clinical trial program evaluating whether a single dose of CABA-201 can provide compelling clinical responses without the need for immunosuppressants,” said Steven Nichtberger, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cabaletta. “We are encouraged by the accelerating pace of enrollment and, data permitting, anticipate meeting with the FDA next year regarding registrational program designs for CABA-201. As we expand our clinical trial network beyond the U.S., we are pleased to welcome Gerwin Winter as Head of International for Cabaletta. Gerwin was most recently head of Europe for Beigene from inception through commercialization leveraging his prior experiences at Portola, Celgene and BMS. His team is already well positioned to leverage the recent EMA CTA authorization for the RESET-SLE trial. We look forward to expanding the opportunity for CABA-201 globally as we seek to develop and launch the first targeted curative cell therapies for patients with autoimmune diseases.”\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights and Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n**CABA-201:** Autologous, engineered T cells designed with a chimeric antigen receptor containing a fully human CD19 binder and a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain as a potential treatment for a broad range of autoimmune diseases where B cells contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of disease.\n\n**Rheumatology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Myositis (idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, IIM)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-Myositis trial is ongoing and additional clinical and translational data from the trial will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024 conference this coming weekend.\n\n\n  * **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**\n    * In October 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) allowed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) submitted by Cabaletta for the RESET-SLE trial to proceed, enabling the Company to begin the process of activating clinical trial sites and pursuing patient enrollment for the RESET-SLE trial.\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-SLE trial is ongoing and additional clinical and translational data from the trial will be presented at ACR Convergence 2024 this coming weekend.\n\n\n  * **Systemic sclerosis (SSc)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-SSc trial is ongoing and initial clinical data from the trial will be presented at ACR Convergence 2024 this coming weekend.\n\n\n\n**Neurology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-MG™ trial is ongoing and initial clinical data from the trial are expected in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Dermatology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Pemphigus vulgaris (PV)**\n    * Patient enrollment is ongoing in the RESET-PV™ trial, formerly referred to as the DesCAARTes™ trial. The trial is evaluating CABA-201 as a monotherapy without preconditioning in patients with mucosal PV (mPV) and mucocutaneous PV (mcPV).\n\n\n\n**External Scientific Presentations and Publications**\n\n  * In October 2024, Cabaletta presented multiple oral and poster presentations at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress, which was held at La Nuvola in Rome, Italy from October 22-25, 2024. Details of the presentations and their associated key findings are below: \n    * Oral presentation (OR022): Correlative findings following DSG3-CAART infusion with and without preconditioning in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (DesCAARTes™ trial). The data showed that the use of preconditioning with DSG3-CAART did not provide serologic or clinical improvement and did not deeply deplete B-cell levels in patients with mPV.\n    * Poster presentation (P0744): Clinical and translational findings following MuSK-CAART infusion without preconditioning in patients with MuSK-associated myasthenia gravis (MuSCAARTes™ trial) in the first two cohorts. The data indicated MuSK-CAART cells demonstrated evidence of biologic and clinical activity in treated patients, suggesting it may be possible to achieve clinical activity with CAR T cells in patients with autoimmune disease without preconditioning. The MusCAARTes™ trial is not currently dosing patients as we evaluate clinical and translational data from the first two cohorts.\n    * Poster presentation (P0824): At-scale autologous CD19-CAR T manufacturing from whole blood collection for the treatment of autoimmune disease: process and product quality assessment. The data demonstrated large scale runs using 200mL whole blood collections yielded similar amounts of CD19-CAR T cells as runs using leukapheresis material and demonstrated similar cytotoxicity across a range of effector to target ratios.\n\n\n  * In November 2024, Cabaletta plans to present new and updated clinical and translational data on CABA-201 in oral and poster presentations at the ACR Convergence 2024 conference, which is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. from November 14-19, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * In October 2024, Gerwin Winter joined the Company as Senior Vice President and Head of International to lead a focused team that has recently been assembled to expand our clinical development in Europe. Mr. Winter has nearly three decades of experience building and leading global clinical and commercial operations teams to bring innovative medicines closer to patients. Prior to joining Cabaletta, he was Senior Vice President, Head of Europe at BeiGene. Before that, Mr. Winter was Senior Vice President and Head of Europe for Portola Pharmaceuticals, building European operations through its acquisition by Alexion in 2020. Previously, he served in multiple positions of increasing responsibility at Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb where he was responsible for multiple launches in hematology and oncology. Mr. Winter holds a PharmD in pharmacy from the University of Munich, Germany and an M.B.A. in general management from CEDEP at INSEAD University of Fontainebleau, France.\n\n\n  * In November 2024, Nicolette Sherman joined the Company as Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). Ms. Sherman succeeds Martha O’Connor, who is retiring and will move into an advisory role as part of a planned transition. Ms. Sherman brings more than two decades of experience leading human resources and organizational functions at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Prior to joining Cabaletta, Ms. Sherman was CHRO at Certara, where she developed and implemented an award-winning human resources program that innovated talent management strategies, strengthened workforce planning and fostered a future-ready culture. Before that, she was CHRO at Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. Earlier, Ms. Sherman served in multiple roles of increasing responsibility at Sanofi, Schering-Plough, AT&T and Prudential. She holds master’s degrees in human resource management from Rutgers University and political science from the University of Delaware, in addition to a B.A. in government from Lehigh University. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Investor Events**\n\n  * The Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Monday, November 18, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to review the CABA-201 clinical data presented at ACR Convergence 2024 and provide an update on the RESET clinical development program.\n\n\n  * The Company will participate in a fireside chat at the Jefferies London Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. GMT in London, UK. \n\n\n\nA live webcast of each presentation will be available on the News and Events section of the Company’s website at [www.cabalettabio.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ARZHLFZpyGTL38Mpm3D0IgpRWoNqQBbEcXpGAyd_e1cAj8brSDxpITeIRC6h9jaIm3F637GLfSyik16_lYl_th9Zc09lxXPHi6c07D2sP3w=).

Following a one-time infusion, CABA-201 is designed to transiently and completely deplete all CD19-positive cells. We believe this approach has the potential to reset the immune system and result in compelling clinical responses without chronic therapy requirements in patients. Cabaletta is currently evaluating CABA-201 in the RESET™ (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program which includes multiple disease-specific, company-sponsored clinical trials across growing portfolios of autoimmune diseases in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology.\n\n**About Cabaletta Bio** Cabaletta Bio (Nasdaq: CABA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases. The CABA™ platform encompasses two complementary strategies which aim to advance the discovery and development of engineered T cell therapies with the potential to become deep and durable, perhaps curative, treatments for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. The lead CARTA (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells for Autoimmunity) strategy is prioritizing the development of CABA-201, a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy. CABA-201 is currently being evaluated in the RESET™ (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology. Cabaletta Bio’s headquarters and labs are located in Philadelphia, PA.

(Nasdaq: CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“Focused clinical execution has resulted in 40 U.S. clinical sites actively recruiting patients for the RESET clinical trial program for CABA-201. At the ACR Convergence conference this coming weekend, we are looking forward to sharing clinical safety and efficacy data from the first 8 myositis, lupus and scleroderma patients in the RESET clinical trial program evaluating whether a single dose of CABA-201 can provide compelling clinical responses without the need for immunosuppressants,” said Steven Nichtberger, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cabaletta. “We are encouraged by the accelerating pace of enrollment and, data permitting, anticipate meeting with the FDA next year regarding registrational program designs for CABA-201. As we expand our clinical trial network beyond the U.S., we are pleased to welcome Gerwin Winter as Head of International for Cabaletta. Gerwin was most recently head of Europe for Beigene from inception through commercialization leveraging his prior experiences at Portola, Celgene and BMS. His team is already well positioned to leverage the recent EMA CTA authorization for the RESET-SLE trial. We look forward to expanding the opportunity for CABA-201 globally as we seek to develop and launch the first targeted curative cell therapies for patients with autoimmune diseases.”\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights and Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n**CABA-201:** Autologous, engineered T cells designed with a chimeric antigen receptor containing a fully human CD19 binder and a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain as a potential treatment for a broad range of autoimmune diseases where B cells contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of disease.\n\n**Rheumatology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Myositis (idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, IIM)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-Myositis trial is ongoing and additional clinical and translational data from the trial will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024 conference this coming weekend.\n\n\n  * **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**\n    * In October 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) allowed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) submitted by Cabaletta for the RESET-SLE trial to proceed, enabling the Company to begin the process of activating clinical trial sites and pursuing patient enrollment for the RESET-SLE trial.\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-SLE trial is ongoing and additional clinical and translational data from the trial will be presented at ACR Convergence 2024 this coming weekend.\n\n\n  * **Systemic sclerosis (SSc)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-SSc trial is ongoing and initial clinical data from the trial will be presented at ACR Convergence 2024 this coming weekend.\n\n\n\n**Neurology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG)**\n    * Patient enrollment in the RESET-MG™ trial is ongoing and initial clinical data from the trial are expected in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Dermatology Portfolio**\n\n  * **Pemphigus vulgaris (PV)**\n    * Patient enrollment is ongoing in the RESET-PV™ trial, formerly referred to as the DesCAARTes™ trial. The trial is evaluating CABA-201 as a monotherapy without preconditioning in patients with mucosal PV (mPV) and mucocutaneous PV (mcPV).\n\n\n\n**External Scientific Presentations and Publications**\n\n  * In October 2024, Cabaletta presented multiple oral and poster presentations at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress, which was held at La Nuvola in Rome, Italy from October 22-25, 2024. Details of the presentations and their associated key findings are below: \n    * Oral presentation (OR022): Correlative findings following DSG3-CAART infusion with and without preconditioning in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (DesCAARTes™ trial). The data showed that the use of preconditioning with DSG3-CAART did not provide serologic or clinical improvement and did not deeply deplete B-cell levels in patients with mPV.\n    * Poster presentation (P0744): Clinical and translational findings following MuSK-CAART infusion without preconditioning in patients with MuSK-associated myasthenia gravis (MuSCAARTes™ trial) in the first two cohorts. The data indicated MuSK-CAART cells demonstrated evidence of biologic and clinical activity in treated patients, suggesting it may be possible to achieve clinical activity with CAR T cells in patients with autoimmune disease without preconditioning. The MusCAARTes™ trial is not currently dosing patients as we evaluate clinical and translational data from the first two cohorts.\n    * Poster presentation (P0824): At-scale autologous CD19-CAR T manufacturing from whole blood collection for the treatment of autoimmune disease: process and product quality assessment. The data demonstrated large scale runs using 200mL whole blood collections yielded similar amounts of CD19-CAR T cells as runs using leukapheresis material and demonstrated similar cytotoxicity across a range of effector to target ratios.\n\n\n  * In November 2024, Cabaletta plans to present new and updated clinical and translational data on CABA-201 in oral and poster presentations at the ACR Convergence 2024 conference, which is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. from November 14-19, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * In October 2024, Gerwin Winter joined the Company as Senior Vice President and Head of International to lead a focused team that has recently been assembled to expand our clinical development in Europe. Mr. Winter has nearly three decades of experience building and leading global clinical and commercial operations teams to bring innovative medicines closer to patients. Prior to joining Cabaletta, he was Senior Vice President, Head of Europe at BeiGene. Before that, Mr. Winter was Senior Vice President and Head of Europe for Portola Pharmaceuticals, building European operations through its acquisition by Alexion in 2020. Previously, he served in multiple positions of increasing responsibility at Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb where he was responsible for multiple launches in hematology and oncology. Mr. Winter holds a PharmD in pharmacy from the University of Munich, Germany and an M.B.A. in general management from CEDEP at INSEAD University of Fontainebleau, France.\n\n\n  * In November 2024, Nicolette Sherman joined the Company as Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). Ms. Sherman succeeds Martha O’Connor, who is retiring and will move into an advisory role as part of a planned transition. Ms. Sherman brings more than two decades of experience leading human resources and organizational functions at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Prior to joining Cabaletta, Ms. Sherman was CHRO at Certara, where she developed and implemented an award-winning human resources program that innovated talent management strategies, strengthened workforce planning and fostered a future-ready culture. Before that, she was CHRO at Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. Earlier, Ms. Sherman served in multiple roles of increasing responsibility at Sanofi, Schering-Plough, AT&T and Prudential. She holds master’s degrees in human resource management from Rutgers University and political science from the University of Delaware, in addition to a B.A. in government from Lehigh University. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Investor Events**\n\n  * The Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Monday, November 18, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to review the CABA-201 clinical data presented at ACR Convergence 2024 and provide an update on the RESET clinical development program.\n\n\n  * The Company will participate in a fireside chat at the Jefferies London Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. GMT in London, UK. \n\n\n\nA live webcast of each presentation will be available on the News and Events section of the Company’s website at [www.cabalettabio.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ARZHLFZpyGTL38Mpm3D0IgpRWoNqQBbEcXpGAyd_e1cAj8brSDxpITeIRC6h9jaIm3F637GLfSyik16_lYl_th9Zc09lxXPHi6c07D2sP3w=). Replays will be available on the website for a limited time.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expenses were $26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n  * General and administrative expenses were $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Cabaletta had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $183.0 million, compared to $241.2 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\nThe Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, will enable it to fund its operating plan into the first half of 2026.\n\n**About CABA-201** CABA-201 is a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy for patients with autoimmune diseases where B cells contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of disease. Following a one-time infusion, CABA-201 is designed to transiently and completely deplete all CD19-positive cells. We believe this approach has the potential to reset the immune system and result in compelling clinical responses without chronic therapy requirements in patients. Cabaletta is currently evaluating CABA-201 in the RESET™ (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program which includes multiple disease-specific, company-sponsored clinical trials across growing portfolios of autoimmune diseases in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology.\n\n**About Cabaletta Bio** Cabaletta Bio (Nasdaq: CABA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases. The CABA™ platform encompasses two complementary strategies which aim to advance the discovery and development of engineered T cell therapies with the potential to become deep and durable, perhaps curative, treatments for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. The lead CARTA (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells for Autoimmunity) strategy is prioritizing the development of CABA-201, a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy. CABA-201 is currently being evaluated in the RESET™ (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology. Cabaletta Bio’s headquarters and labs are located in Philadelphia, PA.
