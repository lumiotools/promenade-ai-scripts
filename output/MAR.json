Parking departments' profit margins in 2023 were higher than other hotel departments, at 61.3%. The growth in parking revenue is attributed to higher prices due to rising costs and increased demand for parking. Resort and airport hotels saw the largest revenue increases. Additionally, the installation of EV charging stations is growing, driven by consumer demand, regulations, and brand requirements. As of 2022, 26.6% of U.S. hotels had EV chargers, with the trend expected to rise. You can read the article here: https://lnkd.in/eHs2DfRX My main takeaways from the article are two-fold: 1. Revenue Potential: The substantial growth in parking revenues, particularly at resort and airport hotels, highlights a significant opportunity for hotels to leverage parking as a key revenue stream. This trend suggests that hotels can benefit from strategically adjusting parking fees and optimizing their parking operations. 2. EV Charging Stations as a Strategic Investment: The increasing installation of EV charging stations reflects a growing demand for sustainability. Hotels that adopt EV chargers not only meet regulatory and consumer expectations but also potentially tap into additional revenue streams, especially given the longer dwell times for overnight guests.

The assistance Hadasha received from the TCRF was used for shelter, food, and clothing during their extended evacuation. \n\n![Hawaii during a storm](https://cache.marriott.com/content/dam/marriott-renditions/dm-static-renditions/digitallegal-micorp-cec/en_us/micorp_take-care-relief-fund/unlimited/photo/assets-usage-rights/pdt-tcr---hawaii-storm-192216575597509-classic-hor.jpg)\n\n###  Hawaii: Flooded with Hope \n\nRainfall is common in Kauai, but a strong storm in Wainiha in April 2018 had Brian fleeing his flooded home.
