(NASDAQ: METC, METCB, \"Ramaco\" or the \"Company\"), a leading operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal, announced that the Company is publishing today the Updated Technical Report Summary (\"Report\") undertaken by its independent reserve geologist, Weir International, Inc. (\"Weir\") regarding Ramaco's Brook Mine rare earth opportunity. The full Report can be found on our website [www.ramacoresources.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4121862-3&h=1116776142&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ramacoresources.com%2F&a=www.ramacoresources.com). In addition to the Report, Ramaco's Chairman and Chief Executive Randall Atkins has written an accompanying Shareholder Letter to explain the Report's findings. The letter also sets forth what steps we have taken to advance the development of the Brook Mine, what independent test results have determined, what steps will be taken toward potential commercialization, and some preliminary structural and financial options. In terms of the Report's key findings, both the reported Brook Mine's rare earth tonnage volume and concentrations estimates have almost doubled since Weir's initial May 2023 Report. Overall tonnage estimates now stand above 1.5 million total in-place rare earth oxide tons, and concentrations average stands at almost 550 parts per million (\"ppm\"). Importantly, a number of material lithologies showed maximum ppm concentrations exceeding 9,000 ppm. In addition, over 10% of the Brook Mine deposit was estimated to contain gallium and germanium, which are two high value critical minerals the export of which was recently banned by China. Lastly, given the significance of the Report, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, March 27, 2024, Ramaco Resources will host an investor conference call and webcast where Randall Atkins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Alex Moyes, Director of Critical Materials and Planning and Jeremy Sussman, Chief Financial Officer will discuss the Report's findings and their implications for the development of the Brook Mine.  The conference call can be accessed by calling 1-877-317-6789 domestically or 1-412-317-6789 internationally.

Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWEIR was retained by Ramaco Resources, Inc. (Ramaco) to prepare a Technical Report\nSummary (TRS), as of March 21, 2024, related to Ramaco’s Rare Earth Element (REE)\nExploration Target near Sheridan, Wyoming. This report has been prepared in accordance with\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Regulation S-K 1300 for\nMining Property Disclosure (S-K 1300) and 17 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §\n229.601(b)(96)(iii)(B) reporting requirements.\nWEIR previously prepared a TRS issued in May 2023 (May 2023 Report), in which WEIR\nprovided a statement of Ramaco’s REE Exploration Target as of April 30, 2023.\nSince the issuance of the May 2023 Report, Ramaco has completed an additional 59 drill holes,\nincreasing the number of REE specific drillholes to 123. Ramaco has also recovered historical\ndrillhole data from 417 coal exploration drillholes completed by previous owners, which\nsignificantly increases the amount of known data relative to geological structure. Additionally,\nrefinements and enhancements were made to sampling and analysis methods and protocols.\nUltimately, as a result of these advancements, Ramaco retained WEIR to provide a statement\nof Ramaco’s REE exploration target, as of March 21, 2024.\nThe key developments that have occurred are detailed in the sections that follow, and\nsummarized as follows:\n• While prior reporting was conducted on a “whole rock-basis”, this TRS reports REE\nconcentration on an “ash-basis” in an attempt to better match this unconventional,\ncarbon-heavy deposit to its anticipated processing methods. Ramaco expects that prior\nto processing, all carbon matter will be removed, in effect, leaving REEs concentrated\nwithin the remaining mineral matter (ash). The REE deposit is therefore now assessed\non the basis of parts per million of mineral matter (ash-basis).\n• Based upon research by independent institutional research laboratories, it is believed\nthat the coal carbon matrix can hinder accurate detection of REEs in samples analyzed\nusing Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In assessing the\nimpact of organic interference in the ICP-MS process, several samples tested\npreviously on a whole rock-basis were ashed and retested on an ash-basis. As such, it\nis estimated that prior REE tonnages in carbonaceous zones may have been\nMarch 21, 2024\nPage 1\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nunderestimated by approximately 10 percent. Re-analysis of previous samples using\nthis new ICP-MS analysis protocol is on-going.\n• Ramaco has increased the amount of drillhole data and associated analyses which have:\n➢ Provided better understanding of locations of elevated REE concentration\noccurrence both spatially and geologically.\n➢ Led to improved protocols for both REE sample selection and analysis.\n➢ Provided higher confidence in REE levels and potential quantities.\n➢ Shown increased REE concentrations and potential quantities.\n• Concentrations of Uranium (U) and Thorium (Th), radioactive contaminants, were\nsampled during portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) scanning and with Inductively\nCoupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses. The results of both methods\nof analysis indicate these elements exist in low, unharmful quantities as compared to\nmany traditional, hard rock deposits in the United States and abroad.\n• Chinese bans on exports of two critical minerals, Gallium (Ga) and Germanium (Ge),\nand the increased prices for these two minerals prompted Ramaco to begin including\nthese two minerals in elemental analyses. The oxides for these elements are referred\nto as Banned Rare Earth Oxides (BREO), and these were not included in the May 2023\nReport.\n• Since the May 2023 Report was issued, the indicated high range Total Rare Earth Oxide\n(TREO) volume has increased by 90 percent, to approximately 1.5 million tons,\ninclusive of the two newly reported minerals - germanium and gallium. Table 1.0-1\nshows the current tonnage and grade range estimate for the Exploration Target.\nTable 1.0-1 Current Brook Mine In-Place REO Exploration Target Tonnage and Grade\nEstimates (Ash-Basis)\nTotal Total Primary Secondary\nModel Model Magnetics Magnetics Heavy Light Total Ga and Ge\nVolume Mass Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade\nRange (M CY) (M Tons) (000) (ppm) (000) (ppm) (000) (ppm) (000) (ppm) (000) (ppm) (000) (ppm)\nLow 2,025 3,922 260 93 72 26 39 14 853 301 1,105 392 114 47\nHigh 2,025 3,922 325 116 90 32 49 17 1066 377 1,382 490 143 59\nNotes:\n• Tonnage estimates reported above are not Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and do not meet the threshold for reserve\nmodifying factors, such as estimated economic viability, that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves. There is no certainty\nthat any part of the Exploration Target tonnage estimates will be converted into Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.\n• The Exploration Target tonnage estimates are based on actual exploration results from 576 drill holes and 1,952 ICP samples.\n• No TREO cut-off grade was applied.\n• The ranges of tonnage and grade of the Exploration Target could change as future exploration activities are completed.\n• Numbers in the table have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate and may not sum due to rounding.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 2\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n• Average TREO concentration across all lithologies tested on an ash-basis showed\nroughly a 60 percent increase in concentration to ~550 ppm since the May 2023 Report\ntest results. This increase has been the result of adding new core drilling and testing, the\naddition of gallium and germanium, and by reporting samples on an ash-basis. The\nchange in average TREO concentration is detailed in Figure 1.0-1:\nFigure 1.0-1 Change in Average TREO Concentration of the Brook Mine Deposit\n• The predominant material in which REE tonnage is found is clay, carbonaceous\nmaterial, and claystone, which together account for 53 percent of the TREO + BREO\ntonnage. Coal zones contain roughly 70,000 tons, or 5 percent of estimated tonnage.\nEstimated tonnage of In-Place TREO + BREO by lithology is detailed in Table 1.0-2:\nTable 1.0-2 Estimated In-Place TREO + BREO Tons by Lithology\nTREO+BREO Tons (000)\nLithology Group (High End of Range) Percentage (%)\nCarbonaceous Material 282.4 19\nClay/Silt 267.9 18\nClaystone 248.5 16\nCoal 70.1 5\nCoal_Mixed 3.3 0\nShale 87.1 6\nSandstone 239.7 16\nScoria 199.3 13\nUnconsolidated 49.5 3\nNot_Logged 59.7 4\nOther 17.3 1\nTotal 1,524.8 100\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 3\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n1.1 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION\nThe REE Exploration Target is located within Ramaco’s mineral holdings at its Brook Mine\nProperty located approximately seven miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming in Sheridan County.\nThe Burlington Northern Railroad and Interstate 90 are located along the southern boundary\nof the current Brook Mine permit area.\nThe Brook Mine Property is situated in the Sheridan Coal Field in the northwestern portion of the\nPowder River Basin (PRB) coal producing region of the of the United States (see Figure 1.1-1).\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle maps are Acme, Hultz\nDraw, Monarch, and Sheridan.\nThe Brook Mine Property consists of approximately 15,800 acres of Ramaco owned and leased\nmineral holdings located in Sheridan County, Wyoming. Ramaco acquired the Brook Mine\nProperty in 2011 from the Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Company. When Ramaco began\ndevelopment of the Brook Mine Property in 2012, Ramaco originally permitted approximately\n4,600 acres that it regarded as the optimal area for a new surface mine. As Ramaco began\nfurther core drilling exploration in 2021 and 2022 relative to REE exploration, Ramaco decided\nto continue to drill in areas within the original permit boundary in order to leverage the existing\ndrilling core available for sampling.\nAs such, the REE Exploration Target is limited to the current permit boundary of the Brook\nMine Property. Ramaco has indicated its intention to proceed with additional drilling and\nassessment of additional areas of the Brook Mine Property to assess the potential for expanding\nits REE Exploration Target.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 4\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nFigure 1.1-1 General Location Map\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 5\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n1.2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION\nThe Sheridan Coal Field is within the northwestern portion of the PRB. The regional geology\nof this area is characterized by a sequence of sedimentary rocks that formed during the Late\nCretaceous to early Paleocene Period. The stratigraphic sequence consists of interbedded\nsandstones, mudstones, and coal seams that were deposited in fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine\nenvironments.\nThe primary coal seams that may be associated with REEs on the Brook Mine Property, in\ndescending stratigraphic order, are the Dietz 1, Dietz 2, Dietz 3, Monarch, Upper Carney,\nLower Carney, and Masters. There are also seven unnamed minor coal seams below the\nMasters Seam.\nThe REEs are believed to have been incorporated into the coal during its formation and are\nfound in association with clay minerals and organic matter in the coal seams. The interburdens\nalso contain elevated levels of REEs, primarily in clays, carbonaceous clays, shales, and\nsiltstones\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has\nsuggested that formationally, REEs may have migrated upwards from depth. Specifically, as\nheated fluids circulated and migrated upwards through faults and fractures, they interacted with\nthe surrounding rock layers, leaching out REEs from primary REE minerals. The higher\ntemperatures of these fluids could have facilitated the dissolution and transport of REEs,\nallowing them to be mobilized over considerable distances. Upon encountering geochemical\nbarriers such as the transition from coal to clay, or shifts in pH and temperature, these fluids\nmay have undergone changes that promoted the precipitation and concentration of REEs.\nFigure 1.2-1 describes the average ash-basis TREO concentration for each major lithology (all\nrock types including coal), as well as the single point maximum. Coal has the highest average\nand single point maximum concentration of all lithologies. For example, the Lower 7 coal seam\nhas average ash-basis concentrations of 5,000 ppm. While the TREO tonnage is not high\nrelative to other lithologies in the deposit, the concentration and tonnage are expected to\nincrease as Ramaco re-samples and increases the number of ICP-MS data points in coal zones.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 6\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nFigure 1.2-1 Average and Maximum TREO + BREO Concentration by Major\nLithology Group (Ash-Basis)\n12,000\n9,897\n10,000 9,101\n8,000 7,343\n6,513\n6,131\n6,000\n4,457 4,387 4,386\n4,126\n4,000 3,619 3,532 3,437\n1,757\n2,000\n968 825 801 684 793 452 576 637 393 538 443\n-\nThe May 2023 Report reported only 3.0 percent of the deposit with concentrations in excess\nof 300 ppm (as reported on a whole rock-basis).

Additional\nexploration plans have yet to be determined and are pending, contingent on analysis of existing\ndata.\nRamaco is pursuing potential pilot production and commercialization at its Brook Mine\nDeposit which entails several critical steps as follows:\n1) Extraction testing through sequential extraction methodologies, to further understand\nthe mineralogical associations of REEs within the ore and identify optimal leaching\nmethods. This approach will provide valuable insights into the complex geological\ncomposition of the coal zones, aiding in the optimization of processing strategies for\nenhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n2) Collaboration with strategic university, governmental and other research institutions to\nexplore unconventional processing techniques.\n3) Continue core logging and mineralogical analysis to understand geological variables\ndriving ore concentrations.\n4) Physical concentration testing to inform design of process flowsheet for pilot\nprocessing.\n5) Preparation of an internal techno-economic model to guide decision-making processes\nwhich incorporates economic and operational factors such as operational expenses,\ncapital expenditures, geological attributes, processing parameters, scale, grade, and\nmarket pricing to determine cutoff grades. Ramaco’s model will also be used to conduct\neconomic and financial simulations, and to identify key variables impacting Net\nPresent Value (NPV).\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 8\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n1.4 EXPLORATION\nDrilling has served as the primary form of exploration within the REE Exploration Target area.\nIn 2019, Ramaco provided drill cores from the Brook Mine Property for a battery of qualitative\nand quantitative analyses conducted by the NETL. Analysis conducted by the NETL included\nthe following:\n• High resolution photographic analysis\n• Analysis of stratigraphic logs from existing coring\n• Lithologic description and analysis\n• Elemental analyses, including:\n➢ REE, trace and major element analysis\n➢ Thermogravimetric analysis\n➢ Bulk X-Ray Diffraction/X-Ray Fluorescence analysis\n➢ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry\n• Microscopy and Microanalysis by:\n➢ Imaging (small and large area)\n➢ Elemental analysis\n➢ Phase Identification\nThe results of the NETL analysis were summarized in October 2020 by the NETL which\nindicated high REE concentrations. This initiated the three subsequent REE exploration\nprograms that Ramaco has completed.\nAs of the issuance of the May 2023 Report, Ramaco had completed drilling for approximately\n70 percent of a 100-hole exploration program. Drilling was completed for this 100-hole\nprogram in July 2023. Since the May 2023 Report, an additional 59 drill holes targeting REEs\nhave been drilled. Additionally, ICP-MS analyses for the cores from these drill holes were\ncompleted by SGS North America, Inc. (SGS) in early January 2024.\nA total of 123 holes drilled by Ramaco, specifically for REE exploration purposes, have served\nto define the Exploration Target. The drilling database also includes 453 coal exploration holes\ndrilled by both previous property owners and Ramaco. A geological model was built using all\n576 of the available exploration drill holes to define structure in a stratigraphic model. A block\nmodel was then built based upon this stratigraphic model to analyze the REE concentrations\nwithin the different lithologies.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 9\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nBased upon the independent analyses performed by SGS and other third parties, including the\nNETL, estimated REE grade may increase at depths beyond the approximate 200-foot average\nhole depths that have previously been completed. To investigate this estimated increase in REE\ngrade, Ramaco completed a core hole, 856 feet in depth, in December 2023. The drillhole’s\nfull length is currently being analyzed using ICP-MS.\nIn addition to detailed geological logging, drill core obtained by Ramaco was analyzed using\nboth portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) and ICP-MS laboratory methods.\nA summary of the drilling data available to date for the Brook Mine Property is summarized\nin Table 1.4-1 as follows:\nTable 1.4-1 Drilling Programs\nBase Data\nDrill Downhole Quality Analysis\nDrill Holes Hole Type Hole Geophysical Deviation Geologist's XRF Analysis(1) ICP Analysis(2)\nExploration Program CountDrill Depth (Ft) Rotary Core Header Logs Log Log Holes Samples Feet Holes Samples Feet\nBighorn Coal Drilling 417 81,083 336 81 417 318 - 417 - - - - - -\nRamaco Coal Drilling 36 7,700 - 36 36 5 - 8 - - - - - -\n2019 Drilling 6 1,132 - 6 6 - - 6 3 125 74 5 115 74\n2021-2022 Drilling 14 1,937 - 14 14 14 - 14 14 2,196 549 14 252 228\n2022-2023 Drilling 102 21,593 - 102 102 - - 100 94 26,173 6,661 94 1,585 1,404\nDeep Drilling(1) 1 856 - 1 1 1 - 1 - - - - - -\nTotal 576 114,301 336 240 576 20 - 546 111 28,494 7,284 113 1,952 1,707\n(1) Through February 25, 2024\n(2) Through March 18, 2024\nAs pXRF devices do not provide measurements for all REE concentrations as accurately as\nICP-MS analyses, the pXRF data is only used procedurally to assist in identifying zones to be\nsent for ICP-MS independent third-party analysis by SGS and is not incorporated into the\nquantitative analysis of this report. Aside from the exclusion of these pXRF scanning results,\nno data collected as a result of known exploration programs to date has been omitted from the\ninput, analysis, or results reported in this TRS.\nAll 576 drill holes detailed above were used to develop a comprehensive geologic structural\nmodel. This geologic structural model was in turn used to define the Exploration Target using\nthe 1,952 ICP-MS assays from 113 drill holes. These ICP-MS quality data points provide\nsufficient coverage of the property to allow for the estimation of in-place REE tonnage and\ngrade. The increase in number of ICP-MS assays from the May 2023 Report to this current\nanalysis is approximately 102 percent.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 10\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nIt is WEIR’s opinion that the adequacy of sample preparation, security, and analytical\nprocedures for holes that were drilled by Ramaco, after acquiring the property, are acceptable\nand that these analytical procedures meet typical industry standards.\nThe adequacy of sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are generally\nunknown for holes that were drilled prior to Ramaco acquiring the property. However, the\ngeologist’s logs for these holes contain sampling descriptions and lithologic descriptions that\nare sufficiently detailed to ascertain that an experienced geologist supervised the drilling and\nsampling, and WEIR supports their use to better define the structure of the deposit. The holes\nthat were drilled prior to Ramaco acquiring the property targeted solely coal, however, they\nare valuable in that they provide insight into lithology and geological structure in general.\n1.5 EXPLORATION TARGET TONNAGE ESTIMATE\nThe REEs and relative categorizations, as defined for purposes of this TRS, are summarized\nin Table 1.5-1 as follows:\nTable 1.5-1 Rare Earth Elements\nAtomic Heavy/ Primary Secondary Critical Critical\nSymbol Element Number Light Magnetic Magnetic Mineral (1) REE(2)\nSc Scandium 21 - - - Yes N/A\nGa Gallium 31 - - - Yes N/A\nGe Germanium 32 - - - Yes N/A\nY Yttrium 39 - - - Yes Yes(4)\nLa Lanthanum 57 Light - - Yes No\nCe Cerium 58 Light - - Yes Excess\nPr Praseodymium 59 Light Yes - Yes No\nNd Neodymium 60 Light Yes - Yes Yes\nPm(3) Promethium 61 - - - - No\nSm Samarium 62 Light - Yes Yes No\nEu Europium 63 - - - Yes Yes\nGd Gadolinium 64 - - Yes Yes No\nTb Terbium 65 - Yes - Yes Yes\nDy Dysprosium 66 - Yes - Yes Yes\nHo Holmium 67 Heavy - Yes Yes Excess\nEr Erbium 68 Heavy - - Yes Yes\nTm Thulium 69 Heavy - - Yes Excess\nYb Ytterbium 70 Heavy - - Yes Excess\nLu Lutetium 71 Heavy - - Yes Excess\n(1) U.S. Geological Survey\n(2) Ekmann, 2012, Reid, 2018\n(3)Promethium is not found in nature on earth\n(4)Yttrium is not a Lanthanoid, but is commonly included as one.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 11\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nWEIR’s evaluation of Ramaco’s REE Exploration Target was conducted in accordance with\nRegulation S-K 1300, and WEIR notes that:\n• Ranges of tonnage and grade of the Exploration Target are conceptual in nature.\n• There has been insufficient exploration of Ramaco’s property to reasonably estimate a\nMineral Resource.\n• It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource.\n• The Exploration Target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an\nestimate of a Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve.\nThe geological model described in Section 6.3 served as the basis for the development of the\nBrook Mine Property Exploration Target tonnage and grade estimates. Tonnage is reported as\nin-place Rare Earth Oxide (REO) weights.\nThe Brook Mine Property Exploration Target in-place TREO + BREO tonnage, as of March\n21, 2024 ranges between 1,220 to 1,525 thousand tons, with a grade ranging between 439 to\n548 ppm on an ash-basis.

This constitutes approximately 10 percent of the total REO tonnage.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 13\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n1.6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSince 2019, Ramaco has been exploring the potential of a REE deposit within its Brook Mine\nProperty. Each successive exploration program has added continued definition of the deposit.\nAt this point, definition of the minerals within the Brook Mine Permit appears to be adequate\nto describe the Exploration Target.\n• Current estimates of the Brook Mine Property Exploration Target in-place TREO\ntonnage (including Ga and Ge oxides), range from 1,220 to 1,525 thousand short tons,\nwith a grade ranging from 439 to 548 ppm.\n• The Primary Magnetic REEs (PMREEs) and Secondary Magnetic REEs (SMREEs)\nare estimated to represent 23.5 and 6.5 percent of the TREOs, respectively, a slight\nincrease from the May 2023 Report.\n• While REOs exist in both the coal and interburden zones modeled, greater REO\ntonnage is found within the interburdens, with approximately 60 percent of the\nestimated REO tonnage located within clays, carbonaceous units, and siltstone\nformations.\n• The pXRF analysis procedures and protocols used to select appropriate higher REE\ngrade samples to submit for third-party ICP-MS analysis were found to be\nconservatively biased within coal zones. It was subsequently deemed appropriate to\nmodify the sample selection protocol in order to more accurately identify high REE\nconcentration lithologies that should have originally been analyzed. Ramaco has now\nrecognized this bias and is systematically resampling multiple coal zones.\n• Additionally, based upon research by independent institutional research laboratories, it\nis believed that the coal carbon matrix can hinder accurate detection of REEs in samples\nanalyzed using ICP-MS. SGS has begun to test carbonaceous samples on an ash-basis,\nby first combusting the sample and then testing the resulting mineral in the ash. In\nassessing the impact of organic interference in the ICP-MS process, several samples\ntested previously on a whole rock-basis were ashed and retested on an ash-basis. By\nconducting this comparison, it is estimated that prior REE tonnages in carbonaceous\nzones may have been underestimated by approximately 10 percent. Re-analysis of\nprevious samples using this new ICP-MS analysis protocol is on-going.\nRamaco’s sample collection, preparation, security, and testing protocols are well documented\nand suffice to provide consistent, reliable, and verifiable data. These protocols are planned to\nbe maintained throughout any subsequent extensions of the current exploration program.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 14\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nAs with any exploration-stage mineral mining project, there are risks and uncertainties\nassociated with TREO tonnage and grade estimates. The existing drill hole density provides\nstrong confidence in structural modeling. Significant progress has been made with ICP-MS\nanalyses to fill-in gaps in the modeling of REO concentrations.\nRegardless of the care taken in defining this Exploration Target, tonnage estimates reported\nthroughout this TRS are not Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and do not meet the\nthreshold for reserve modifying factors that would allow for conversion to Mineral Reserves.\nThere is no certainty that any part of the Exploration Target tonnage estimates will be\nconverted into Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.\nWEIR advises that there are still many issues to be addressed for one to conclude that prospects\nare reasonable for economically feasible extraction of the minerals at this time. Work is\ncurrently ongoing to address these issues.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 15\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n2.0 INTRODUCTION\n2.1 REGISTRANT\nWEIR was retained by Ramaco (Nasdaq: METC) to update the existing TRS, which was dated\nMay 2, 2023, related to Ramaco’s REE Exploration Target. The REE Exploration Target is\nlocated within Ramaco’s mineral holdings at its Brook Mine Property located approximately\nseven miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming.\n2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE AND PURPOSE\nThis TRS was prepared specifically for Ramaco’s REE Exploration Target. The tonnages\nwithin the REE Exploration Target have been classified in accordance with SEC mining\nproperty disclosure rules under Subpart 1300 and Item 601 (96)(B)(iii) of Regulation S-K.\nUnless otherwise stated, all quantities, qualities, distances, and currencies are expressed in\nUnited States customary units.\nDespite the presence of coal within the Brook Mine Property, this TRS does not report\nestimates of coal tonnage or quality associated with Ramaco’s mineral holdings.\nUnder Regulation S-K 1300, an Exploration Target is defined as a statement or estimate of the\nexploration potential of a mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement\nor estimate, quoted as a range of tonnage and a range of grade (or quality), relates to\nmineralization for which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral\nResource.\nREEs are comprised of a group of 17 chemically similar elements that include the Lanthanoids\n(atomic numbers 57-71), and Scandium and Yttrium. These elements are critical in the\nmanufacturing of advanced materials, and development of new technologies supporting the\nUnited States’ infrastructure, defense, and energy needs. REEs are typically found in bedrock\nand regolith-hosted geologic ore deposits. Domestic coal deposits have also been identified as\npromising sources of REEs and other critical minerals. Two additional critical minerals, Ga\nand Ge, have been included in this TRS.\nThe REEs and relative categorizations, as defined for purposes of this TRS, are summarized\nin Table 2.2-1 as follows:\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 16\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nTable 2.2-1 Rare Earth Elements\nAtomic Heavy/ Primary Secondary Critical Critical\nSymbol Element Number Light Magnetic Magnetic Mineral (1) REE(2)\nSc Scandium 21 - - - Yes N/A\nGa Gallium 31 - - - Yes N/A\nGe Germanium 32 - - - Yes N/A\nY Yttrium 39 - - - Yes Yes(4)\nLa Lanthanum 57 Light - - Yes No\nCe Cerium 58 Light - - Yes Excess\nPr Praseodymium 59 Light Yes - Yes No\nNd Neodymium 60 Light Yes - Yes Yes\nPm(3) Promethium 61 - - - - No\nSm Samarium 62 Light - Yes Yes No\nEu Europium 63 - - - Yes Yes\nGd Gadolinium 64 - - Yes Yes No\nTb Terbium 65 - Yes - Yes Yes\nDy Dysprosium 66 - Yes - Yes Yes\nHo Holmium 67 Heavy - Yes Yes Excess\nEr Erbium 68 Heavy - - Yes Yes\nTm Thulium 69 Heavy - - Yes Excess\nYb Ytterbium 70 Heavy - - Yes Excess\nLu Lutetium 71 Heavy - - Yes Excess\n(1) U.S. Geological Survey\n(2) Ekmann, 2012, Reid, 2018\n(3)Promethium is not found in nature on earth\n(4)Yttrium is not a Lanthanoid, but is commonly included as one.\n2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND DATA\nThe primary information used in this study was obtained from the following sources:\n• Mineral and surface ownership maps, and supplemental files provided by Ramaco.\n• Drilling geological data provided by Ramaco and WWC Engineering (WWC). The\ngeological data includes drill hole information such as driller’s logs, geologist’s logs,\nboth full and partial scans of geophysical logs, survey data, and MS Excel™ (Excel)\nversions of drill hole survey and lithology data.\n• pXRF REE quality laboratory analysis was provided by Ramaco\n• ICP-MS REE quality laboratory analysis relied upon for this study was primarily\nconducted by SGS. Other laboratories have been utilized from time to time in order to\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 17\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nperform comparative analysis checks. The laboratories involved are detailed in Section\n8.0 of this TRS.\n• Interviews between WEIR personnel and Ramaco personnel including:\n➢ Chief Executive Officer\n➢ Chief Operating Officer\n➢ Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer\n➢ Senior Vice President and Chief Mine Development Officer\n➢ Director of Development for Carbon Products\n➢ Director of Life Sciences\n➢ Manager of Laboratory Technologies\n➢ Laboratory Technician\n➢ Contract Geologist\n➢ Contract Driller\nA detailed list of all data received and reviewed for this study is provided in Sections 24.0 and\n25.0 of this TRS.\n2.4 DETAILS OF THE PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE\nPROPERTY\nWEIR personnel visited the site from July 10 through 11, 2023. WEIR met with various\nRamaco personnel at their site office and discussed project status and plans. WEIR was given\na demonstration of pXRF sample preparation and analysis and ICP-MS sample preparation.\nWEIR also visited the Brook Mine Permit area, accompanied by WWC, in order to observe\ndrilling equipment and activities and general site layout and conditions.\nWEIR’s concluded that Ramaco has facilities and equipment that are more than adequate to\nperform the tasks required for Ramaco’s exploration program. Drilling for the 100-hole\nprogram was nearly completed at the time of the site visit.\n2.5 PREVIOUS TECHNICAL REPORT SUMMARY\nWEIR previously prepared an initial disclosure of an REE Exploration Target for the Brook\nMine Property, dated May 2, 2023 (May 2023 Report).\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 18\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION\n3.1 PROPERTY LOCATION\nThe REE Exploration Target is located within Ramaco’s mineral holdings at its Brook Mine\nProperty, located approximately seven miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming in Sheridan County.\nThe Burlington Northern Railroad and Interstate 90 are located along the southern boundary\nof the current Brook Mine permit area.\nThe REE Exploration Target and the Brook Mine Property are situated in the Sheridan Coal\nField in the northwestern portion of the PRB coal producing region of the of the United States\n(see Figure 1.1-1). The USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle map sheets are Acme, Hultz Draw,\nMonarch, and Sheridan, and the property lies within Townships 56 and 57 North, Ranges 84\nand 85 West.\n3.2 PROPERTY AREA\nThe Brook Mine Property consists of over 15,800 acres of Ramaco owned and leased mineral\nholdings located in Sheridan County, Wyoming. Ramaco acquired the Brook Mine Property\nin 2011 from the Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Company, then a subsidiary of The Brinks\nCompany\nWhen Ramaco began development of the Brook Mine Property as a thermal coal resource in\n2012, Ramaco originally permitted approximately 4,600 acres that it regarded as the optimal\narea for a new surface coal mine. As Ramaco began further core drilling exploration in 2021\nand 2022 relative to REE exploration, Ramaco decided to continue to drill in areas within the\noriginal permit boundary and at comparable depths related to coal mining in order to leverage\nthe existing drilling core available for sampling.\nAs such, the REE Exploration Target is limited to the permit boundary of the Brook Mine\nProperty and at relatively shallow depths given that both US Geological Survey and historical\ndata indicate coal deposits as deep as approximately 1,200 feet. Ramaco has indicated its\nintention to proceed with additional drilling and assessment of the entire Brook Mine Property\nto assess the potential for expanding its REE Exploration Target both beyond the current permit\nboundary and at deeper depths. To that end, Ramaco has recently drilled a core hole, 856 feet\nin depth, which is in the process of being tested for REE concentrations.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 19\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nRamaco’s properties and facilities in the Sheridan, Wyoming area include the Brook Mine\n(which is currently undeveloped), the iCAM (Innovating Carbon Advanced Materials) Center,\nand the iPark Center.\nThe iCAM Center is the nation’s first integrated carbon resource, research and development,\nand production facility. It hosts research professionals from national laboratories, universities,\nprivate research groups, government organizations, as well as manufacturing organizations in\nlaboratory, pilot-plant, and permanent operating facilities. The iCam Center promotes\ncollaboration to achieve innovations around advanced uses for carbon derived from coal.\nThe iPark Center is intended to become a next generation mine-mouth “coal to products”\nmanufacturing facility, with zero net emissions. Located next to the Brook Mine Property,\noperations at the iPark Center intend to utilize coal from the mine to create high-value carbon\nproducts. These products include carbon fiber, graphene, graphite, carbon nano tubes, carbon\ndots, carbon-based resins, carbon-based building products, medical products, and activated\ncarbon.\n3.3 PROPERTY CONTROL\nRamaco was granted a mineral deed from the Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Company (SWCC) on\nAugust 17, 2011. SWCC had previously deeded the surface rights, as described in Table 3.3-\n1, to Big Horn Coal Company on June 28, 1954, and recorded in Deed Book 98, Page 127 in\nthe Sheridan County Courthouse.

The main\ndrainages in the area are the eastward flowing Tongue River and Goose Creek, flowing to the\nnorth. The confluence of these drainages is near the old town of Acme in Section 22.\n4.2 PROPERTY ACCESS\nAccess to the property is from Interstate Highway 90, which crosses the property from west to\nsouth. State Highway 338, which connects Sheridan to Decker, Montana, crosses the\nsoutheastern portion of the Brook Mine permit area. Secondary roads and trails provide access\nto the remaining lands. Rail access is by the Burlington Northern Railroad, which is located in\nthe Tongue River and Goose Creek valleys.\nThe nearest airport is the Sheridan County Airport (SHR), which is located in Sheridan,\nWyoming, approximately 11 miles southeast of the Brook Mine Property. The Billings Logan\nInternational Airport (BIL) in Billings, Montana, is located approximately 95 miles northwest\nof the Brook Mine Property.\nThe waterways surrounding the property are not navigable for commercial traffic.\n4.3 CLIMATE AND OPERATING SEASON\nThe Brook Mine Property has a semi-arid climate with four distinct seasons. The summers are\nwarm and dry, with temperatures ranging from the mid-80 to low 90 degrees Fahrenheit (28-\n33 Celsius) in July and August. The winters are cold and snowy, with temperatures averaging\n20-30 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 to -1 Celsius) in December and January. Spring and fall are\ntransitional seasons, with cooler temperatures and occasional rain and snow.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 30\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nCoal mining operations in the PRB operate year-round, regardless of weather conditions.\n4.4 INFRASTRUCTURE\nThis TRS does not address existing, planned, or required infrastructure that may relate to\ndevelopment of the REE Exploration Target at the Brook Mine Property.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 31\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n5.0 HISTORY\n5.1 PREVIOUS OPERATIONS\nMuch of the history of coal mining in the Sheridan Coal Field was provided in a John T. Boyd\nCompany report, Potentially Strip Mineable Coal Reserves Contained on the Sheridan-\nWyoming Coal Company Property, dated November 20, 1979 (Boyd Report).\nThe Boyd Report indicated that underground coal mining began in the Sheridan coal field\naround 1894 and lasted until 1953. During this period, there were 14 deep mines in the vicinity\nof the Brook Mine Property. The coal was used domestically in the Sheridan area, and to supply\nthe railroad. Most of the mines were individually owned until 1920 when the major mines, the\nDietz, Acme, Model, Carney, Monarch and Kooi, were consolidated and incorporated under\nthe Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Company, a subsidiary of United States Distributing Corporation.\nThis corporation and the subsidiary, Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Company, merged with The\nPittston Company in 1943.\nInformation on these mines is very sparce and consists of mine maps on six of the mines,\nalthough boundaries are available on all of the mines. In March 1978, Boyd Company\nengineers visited the Wyoming Inspector of Mines in Rock Springs and reviewed mine maps\non the Monarch Mine 45, Monarch Mine 45-2, Acme Mine 42, Hotchkiss, Model, and\nArmstrong mines.\nBottom of seam elevations were shown for all the mines except Model and Armstrong; seam\nheights were available only for the Acme Mine 42. Available data indicates that the bottom 14\nfeet of the Monarch Seam was mined in the Monarch Mine 45-2. The maps also indicate that\npillars were pulled during retreat mining; i.e., the majority of pillars in Monarch Mine 45 and\nAcme Mine 42, and 20 percent in Monarch Mine 45-2. Excessive subsidence of the Acme\nMine 42 and Dietz No. 1 and 2 mines can be seen in aerial photographs.\nIn 1943, Peter Kiewit Sons’ Company formed a coal mining subsidiary, the Big Horn Coal\nCompany (Big Horn). Operations commenced on a Wyoming state lease in Section 36 (T.\n58N., R. 85W.), located approximately three miles north of the northwest corner of the Brook\nMine Property. In 1954, Big Horn entered into a coal lease agreement with the SWCC and\noperations commenced in Section 22 (T. 57N., R. 84W.). From 1954 through 1969, coal\nproduction averaged about 350,000 tons per year. In 1970, coal production increased to\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 32\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\napproximately one million tons per year due to increased demand for western coal. Big Horn\nabandoned its mining operations in 2000.\n5.2 PREVIOUS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\nExploration of the Brook Mine Property, prior to Ramaco’s ownership, was limited to coal\nexploration drilling. In total, data is now available for 453 coal exploration drill holes. Of\nthese holes, 417 were drilled prior to 2011 by previous owners. Ramaco drilled 36 of the total\n453 coal exploration drillholes soon after acquiring the property. The assaying of drilled core\nwas targeted at testing thermal coal quality, including moisture, ash, sulfur, and calorific value.\nNo sampling was conducted at the time relative to REE concentrations.\nWEIR has reviewed these historical drill holes and successfully correlated the holes with\ndrilling conducted by Ramaco.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 33\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING, MINERALIZATION, AND DEPOSIT\n6.1 REGIONAL, LOCAL, AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY\n6.1.1 Regional Geology\nThe Sheridan Coal Field is within the northwestern portion of the PRB. The regional geology\nof this area is characterized by a sequence of sedimentary rocks that formed during the Late\nCretaceous to early Paleocene Periods. The stratigraphic sequence consists of interbedded\nsandstones, mudstones, and coal seams that were deposited in fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine\nenvironments.\nThe Sheridan Coal Field is situated within the Tongue River Member of the Fort Union\nFormation. This formation is composed of interbedded sandstones, shales, and coals that were\ndeposited during the Paleocene Period. The thickness of the Tongue River Member varies from\n150 to 400 feet and contains several coal seams that range in thickness from 1 to 30 feet. These\nseams exist down to depths of approximately 1,200 feet across the property.\nThe coal seams in the Sheridan Coal Field are classified as low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal.\nThese coals have a low ash content, high calorific value, and low sulfur content, making the\ncoal ideal fuel for power generation. The coal seams are generally continuous over large areas\nand are flat-lying, and amenable to surface mining.\nThe sedimentary rocks in the Sheridan Coal Field were deposited in a series of ancient rivers\nand lakes that once covered the area. These rivers and lakes were fed by the highlands to the\nwest and north, and the sediment was deposited as the water slowed and lost its carrying\ncapacity. The sandstones were deposited in the channels of the rivers, while the shales and\nmudstones were deposited in the floodplains and lakes.\nThe regional geology of the Sheridan Coal Field has been influenced by tectonic activity in the\nregion. The area has experienced several episodes of uplift and subsidence, which have created\na series of fault blocks and basins. The coal seams in the Sheridan Coal Field are located in\none of these basins, which has preserved the coal seams from erosion and allowed the seams\nto be mined.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 34\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n6.1.2 Local Geology\nThe Brook Mine Property is located on the western edge of a broad plain that extends from the\nBighorn Mountains to the Black Hills of South Dakota. This area is characterized by high\nplateaus, which have been dissected by meandering streams, leaving ridges between the main\nwatersheds. Surface elevations range from a low of 3,600 feet above MSL on the eastern edge\nof the property to a high of 4,080 feet above MSL in the northwest. The main drainages in the\narea are the eastward flowing Tongue River and Goose Creek, flowing to the north. The\nconfluence of these drainages is near the old town of Acme in Section 22.\nStructurally, the seams dip to the southeast at one to four degrees. Locally the dip may reverse\ndue to differential compaction. Fault traces over the Brook Mine Property have been presented\nin past studies. However, these faults are not consistent with newly available drill hole data,\nand could be more attributed to local steep rolls as there are no distinguishable breaks in\nmodeled floor contours.\n6.1.3 Property Geology\nThe primary coal seams associated with REEs on the Brook Mine Property, in descending\nstratigraphic order, are the Dietz 1, Dietz 2, Dietz 3, Monarch, Upper Carney, Lower Carney,\nand Masters. There are also seven unnamed seams below the Masters Seam that have been\nincluded in the models. There are several other coal seams below these down to depths of\napproximately 1,200 feet. Most of these seams are fairly thin (1-2 feet) and unnamed.\nHowever, within this lower group, the Upper Pawnee, Lower Pawnee, and Wall seams are\nfound.\n6.2 MINERAL DEPOSIT TYPE\nThe coal seams can contain significant quantities of REEs, making the coal seams an attractive\nsource for these valuable minerals on an ash-basis. The REEs are believed to have been\nincorporated into the coal during its formation and are found in association with clay minerals\nand organic matter in the coal seams. Interburden between the coal seams also contain elevated\nlevels of REEs, primarily in clays, carbonaceous clays, and siltstones not necessarily associated\nwith the coal seams.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 35\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nIn exploring REE mineralization at the planned Brook Mine, a hypothesis has emerged, as\nproposed by the NETL in collaboration with WEIR and Ramaco. Notably, various coals within\nthe mine property have REE concentrations far surpassing those observed in coals worldwide,\nincluding others in the Powder River Basin (PRB).\nAccording to this hypothesis, the concentrated REEs within the coals may be attributed to the\ninfiltration of fluids through permeable and porous coal zones (via cleat fracturing) and other\ncarrier beds, such as sandstones. These fractured zones have been identified in core, but not\nmapped and correlated to the highest concentration zones. The fluid flow is believed to have\ninduced an acidic environment within the coals, due to the inherent organic concentrations,\nwhile transporting dissolved metals in solution. This is evidenced by the identification of\ngypsum within the mineralized coal zones. The REE metals could have precipitated and\naccumulated within oxide minerals at coal/clay boundaries, where varying redox conditions\nand pH differences facilitated the REEs’ aggregation and high-grading, particularly the\nmedium and heavy REEs (MREEs and HREEs). The thickness of these high-grade zones can\nreach up to eight feet in the cores analyzed (per NETL).\nAn important component of this hypothesis is establishing if the mineralization is primary or\nsecondary. It could be possible that the source of the Medium and Heavy REEs (MREEs and\nHREEs) could be primary deposition via airborne particles of volcanic origin, proximal to this\nparticular peat system, and incorporated into the coals during deposition. The substantial\nvolume of coal, reaching a thickness of 30-feet in some zones, certainly implies a dominant\nairborne input. A comprehensive understanding of the cleat systems is imperative to\nsubstantiate the viability of fluid flow through coals as carrier beds.\n6.3 GEOLOGICAL MODEL\nTwo geological models were constructed using Datamine’s MineScape® software. This\ninvolved a primary stratigraphical model and a resultant block model. The primary\nstratigraphical model delineated coal seams and interburdens as zone input for the block model.\nThe block model was specifically created for REE estimates, with no consideration for coal\nresources. The stratigraphic model is well suited for coal estimates, however, coal mineral\nestimation is not the subject of this TRS.\nThe stratigraphic model was created based on ArcGIS® World3D topography. In the United\nStates, this incorporates topography from the USGS 3-D elevation project. Topography data\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 36\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nwas gridded using MineScape software and a grid cell size of 50 feet by 50 feet from the USGS\non-line 3-D Elevation Project data source. The resolution of the topography data is 1/3 arc-\nsecond, which results in approximately a 30 by 30 feet data point spacing. The gridded USGS\ntopography contours were compared to drill hole collars. WEIR investigated and resolved\nsignificant collar elevation discrepancies.\nThe block model was constructed using a cell size of 50 feet x 50 feet x 0.5 foot (i, j, k vectors).\nThe k vector was selected to closely reflect the average pXRF sample interval of 0.25 foot. An\ninverse distance interpolator with the power of 2 was used to interpolate quality analyses into\nthe block model. A search radius of 5,000 feet was implanted based on WEIR’s experience.\nDrill hole spacing was designed at 1,000 feet, which in WEIR’s opinion is acceptable for\nmineral concentration interpretations.\nThe seam surfaces and thicknesses were created by loading the drilling and mine measurement\ndata into MineScape and gridding the seam intercepts using a grid cell size of 50 feet by 50\nfeet. The parameters used to create the model are defined in the MineScape modeling schema,\nwhich is a specification of modeling rules created for the site. The MineScape interpolators\nthat were used in this study are common in most mine planning software. The Planar\ninterpolator is a triangulation method with extrapolation enabled. Finite Element Analysis\n(FEM) is a widely used method for numerically solving differential equations arising in\nengineering and mathematical modeling. A trend surface is used in MineScape to promote\nconformability for the modeled seams to regional structures, such as synclines, anticlines, or\nsimply seam dip. MineScape caters to using different interpolators for thickness, roof and floor\nsurfaces, and the selected trend surface as all are modeled separately. The interpolator used for\neach of these items is selected on the basis of appropriateness to the data sets involved, as well\nas modeling experience. Stratigraphic Model Interpolators are shown in Table 6.3-1, as\nfollows:\nTable 6.3-1 Stratigraphic Model Interpolators\nInterpolator Parameter Power/Order\nPLANAR Thickness 0\nFEM Surface 1\nPLANAR Trend 0\nThe geological model described above served as the basis for the development of the Brook\nMine Property REE Exploration Target tonnage and grade estimates.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 37\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n6.4 STRATIGRAPHIC COLUMN AND CROSS SECTION\nFigure 6.4-1 shows the stratigraphic column for the REE Exploration Target.

Analysis conducted by NETL included the\nfollowing:\n• High resolution photographic analysis\n• Analysis of stratigraphic logs from existing coring\n• Lithologic description and analysis\n• Elemental analyses, including:\n➢ REE, trace and major element analysis\n➢ Thermogravimetric analysis\n➢ Bulk X-Ray Diffraction/X-Ray Fluorescence analysis\n➢ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry\n• Microscopy and Microanalysis by:\n➢ Imaging (small and large area)\n➢ Elemental analysis\n➢ Phase Identification\nThe results of the NETL analysis were summarized in October 2020 by the NETL indicating\nthat “Based on this data the Brook Mine would rank as among the highest concentrations of\nREEs found in any deposits on a world-wide basis, including Chinese deposits.” The NETL\nprepared a comparative figure ranking the Brook Mine Property as promising to highly\npromising to contain the full range of REEs. The NETL’s comparative plot is found on Figure\n7.1-1 as follows:\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 42\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nFigure 7.1-1 Comparative Analysis of Promisivity\nAs a result of the preliminary analysis conducted in conjunction with the NETL, between\nNovember 2021 and February 2022, Ramaco completed a comprehensive exploration drilling\nand coring program consisting of 14 new drill holes (1,937 linear feet of core drilling),\ntargeting the Monarch, Upper Carney, and Masters coal seams across the Brook Mine Property.\nThis exploration program marked the first time the Masters Seam had been sampled and\nanalyzed for REEs within the Brook Mine Property.\nIn April 2022, Ramaco initiated an additional 100-hole exploration program at the Brook Mine\nProperty. This continued exploration was designed to establish a 1,000 feet sampling grid for\nthe Dietz, Monarch, Carney, and Masters coal seams within the Brook Mine Property permit\narea. Planned analysis of the new drill core data included pXRF analysis, as well as targeted\nsecondary ICP-MS testing. This drilling program was completed in July 2023. The targeted\nsecondary ICP-MS testing was completed in January 2024.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 43\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nDrilling locations for this 100-hole program were determined by Ramaco to provide uniform\nsampling of the subsurface mineral. Coring locations were laid out in a grid format, with\napproximately 1,000 feet between each planned subsurface 3-inch cylindrical core.\nBased upon the independent test results by SGS, there has been estimation by Ramaco and\nother third parties that REE grade could increase at depths beyond the approximate 200 foot\naverage hole depths that have previously been completed. To investigate this estimated REE\ngrade increase, Ramaco completed an 856-foot depth core hole in December 2023 with the full\nlength currently being analyzed using ICP-MS.\nThe location of all drill holes on the REE Exploration Target is provided on Figure 7.1-2.\nFigure 7.1-2 Drill hole Locations\nDrilling and subsequent sampling data collected to date and incorporated into the results\nreported in this TRS are summarized in Table 7.1-2.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 44\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nTable 7.1-2 Drilling Programs\nBase Data\nDrill Downhole Quality Analysis\nDrill Holes Hole Type Hole Geophysical Deviation Geologist's XRF Analysis(1) ICP Analysis(2)\nExploration Program Count Drill Depth (Ft) Rotary Core Header Logs Log Log Holes Samples Feet Holes Samples Feet\nBighorn Coal Drilling 417 81,083 336 81 417 318 - 417 - - - - - -\nRamaco Coal Drilling 36 7,700 - 36 36 5 - 8 - - - - - -\n2019 Drilling 6 1,132 - 6 6 - - 6 3 125 74 5 115 74\n2021-2022 Drilling 14 1,937 - 14 14 14 - 14 14 2,196 549 14 252 228\n2022-2023 Drilling 102 21,593 - 102 102 - - 100 94 26,173 6,661 94 1,585 1,404\nDeep Drilling(1) 1 856 - 1 1 1 - 1 - - - - - -\nTotal 576 114,301 336 240 576 20 - 546 111 28,494 7,284 113 1,952 1,707\n(1) Through February 25, 2024\n(2) Through Marcb 18, 2024\nAs pXRF devices do not provide reliable measurements of all REE concentrations, pXRF data\nis not incorporated into the quantitative analysis of this report. It is only used procedurally to\nassist in identifying zones to be sent for ICP-MS confirmatory analysis. Aside from the\nexclusion of these pXRF scanning results, no data collected as a result of known exploration\nprograms to date, has been omitted from the input, analysis, or results reported in this TRS.\nAll 576 drill holes detailed above were used to develop a comprehensive geologic structural\nmodel. This geologic structural model was in turn used to define the Exploration Target using\nthe 1,952 ICP-MS assays from 113 drill holes. These ICP-MS quality data points provide\nsufficient coverage of the property to allow for the estimation of in-place REE tonnage and\ngrade. The increase in number of ICP-MS assays from the May 2023 Report is approximately\n102 percent.\nA detailed listing of drill hole data can be found in Appendix A.\nWEIR did not have direct involvement with the implementation or supervision of Ramaco’s\ndrilling programs to date. These programs have been conducted by Kid Pronghorn Enterprises,\nInc. (Sheridan, Wyoming) an independent drilling contractor overseen by the independent\nengineering firm, WWC. However, having reviewed the progress of the drilling program, and\nhaving had many technical discussions with Ramaco personnel and third-party consultants,\nWEIR finds the results to be consistent with industry standards and appropriate for use in this\nTRS.\n7.1.1 Planned Drilling\nInfill drilling will continue to be conducted to validate and delineate the highest-grade zones\nthat are beginning to emerge based on elemental testing and geologic mapping. To the best of\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 45\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nWEIR’s knowledge and observations, Ramaco’s recent drilling programs and associated\nmethodologies are safe, successful, and productive. WEIR confirms that Ramaco intends to\nutilize similar drill hole spacing, processes, protocols and chain of custody requirements as\nutilized during the existing core drilling program, as well as the improved pXRF and ICP-MS\nsampling and analysis protocols.\n7.2 NON-DRILLING EXPLORATION\nDrilling has served as the primary form of exploration within the REE Exploration Target.\n7.3 HYDROGEOLOGICAL DATA\nRamaco has not gathered hydrogeological data at this stage of exploration for its planned\noperations at the REE Exploration Target.\n7.4 GEOTECHNICAL DATA\nRamaco has not gathered geotechnical data at this stage of exploration for its planned\noperations at the REE Exploration Target.\n7.5 OTHER RELEVANT DRILLING DATA\nRamaco employs Kid Pronghorn Enterprises, Inc. (Sheridan, Wyoming) to perform\nexploration drilling. Downhole geophysical logging was not conducted during the 100-hole\nexploration program. However, the most recent 856-foot depth hole was geophysically logged.\n7.6 EXPLORATION TARGET\nWEIR’s evaluation of Ramaco’s REE Exploration Target was conducted in accordance with\nRegulation S-K 1300, and WEIR notes that:\n• Ranges of tonnage and grade of the Exploration Target are conceptual in nature\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 46\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n• There has been insufficient demonstration of economic viability or methodologies for\ndevelopment of the Exploration Target to estimate a Mineral Resource or Reserve.\n• It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource\nor Reserve.\n• The Exploration Target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an\nestimate of a Mineral Resource or Reserve\nThe geological model described in Section 6.3 served as the basis for the development of the\nBrook Mine Property REE Exploration Target tonnage and grade estimates described in the\nfollowing sections.\n7.6.1 Assumptions, Parameters, and Methods\nWhile ICP-MS elemental analysis is reported on the basis of concentration and mass of rare\nearth elements, for purposes of reporting results in a fashion consistent with industry practice,\nelemental mass is converted to oxide mass.

These REEs exhibit unique magnetic properties and are commercially valuable\ndue to high demand and scarce supply. For purposes of this TRS, these elements are defined\nas the Primary Magnetic REEs (PMREEs). PMREEs are important components for super-\npower constant magnets, which are critical in industrial generators and in transforming any\nkind of energy (wind, tidal, thermal, etc.) into electricity. Another group of magnetic REEs,\nincluding Samarium, Gadolinium, and Holmium, exhibit similar magnetic properties, but\ngiven minor commercial significance, these magnetic REEs are categorized here as Secondary\nMagnetics REEs (SMREE).\nHeavy REEs (HREEs) include Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, and Lutetium. HREEs\nare also of particular value given relative shortages in supply.

World coal is estimated at 68 ppm on a whole rock-basis (Ketris and\nYudovich, 2009) and 485 ppm on an ash-basis (Dai, 2016). As can be seen on Figure 7.6-2,\nthere are multiple coal seams that on a whole rock and ash-basis greatly exceed world and US\ncoal and coal ash averages. These zones will be further delineated with infill drilling as well\nas re-testing of core where the coal seams were not sampled due to pXRF calibration issues.\nWith additional sampling of core, it is expected that average TREO concentrations will\nincrease within coal zones, resulting in increased tonnage associated with all coal zones.\nIn addition to high concentrations of TREO, the Brook Mine also contains significant\nconcentrations of Ga and Ge. Combined, Ga and Ge have an average concentration of ~50 ppm\nacross the deposit, while in some lithologies such as siltstones, Ga and Ge average 60 ppm\nwith a maximum as high as ~2,500 ppm on an ash-basis. As Ramaco continues to test Ga and\nGe in new core, it is expected that tonnage and grade will increase, and further high-grade\nzones will emerge as prospective mining targets.\nThe estimate of distribution of REOs by oxide are displayed on Figure 7.6-3 as follows:\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 51\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nFigure 7.6-3 Estimated TREO Distribution by Oxide\n40.0\n34.8\n35.0\n30.0\n25.0\n20.0 18.1\n16.3\n15.0 13.2\n10.0\n4.4\n5.0 2.5 3.1 2.9\n0.4 0.5 0.7 1.4 0.2 1.4 0.2\n-\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 52\n)OERT\n%(\nnoitubirtsiD\ndetamitsE\nPrimary Magnetics\n(23.6%)\nSecondary Magnetics\n(6.5%)\nEstimates of distribution of Total REOs by Lithology Type are displayed on Figure 7.6-4 as\nfollows:\nFigure 7.6-4 Estimated TREO Distribution by Lithology Type\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nThe distribution of REOs by lithology type and concentration are further summarized in Table\n7.6-4 as follows:\nTable 7.6-4 TREO Distribution by Lithology Group\nTREO + BREO Carbonaceous Coal Not\nConcentration (ppm) Material Clay/Silt Claystone Coal Mixed Shale Sandstone Scoria Unconsolidated Logged Other Total %\n<200 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.00 - 0.00 0.17 0.00 - 0.00 - 0.23\n200-300 2.06 2.43 2.48 0.12 0.01 0.78 1.06 2.25 0.42 0.76 0.17 12.54\n300-400 12.49 12.96 10.42 0.79 0.18 3.87 10.12 9.65 2.72 3.01 0.95 67.16\n400-500 3.66 2.07 2.38 0.47 0.03 0.84 3.11 1.15 0.09 0.13 0.01 13.93\n500-750 0.19 0.08 0.95 0.31 - 0.12 0.39 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 2.06\n750-1000 0.01 0.00 0.04 0.04 - 0.01 0.69 0.00 - 0.00 - 0.80\n1000-2000 0.01 0.00 0.00 1.04 - 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 - 1.11\n>2000 0.09 0.01 0.01 1.83 0.00 0.06 0.18 0.00 0.00 0.00 - 2.19\nTotal 18.52 17.57 16.30 4.60 0.22 5.71 15.72 13.07 3.25 3.91 1.13 100.00\n7.6.3 Uncertainty in Estimates of Tonnage\nThe range of tonnage and grade of the Brook Mine Property REE Exploration Target could\nchange as proposed exploration activities are completed. A range of 25 percent has been\napplied to all tonnage and grade estimates.\nModeling of tonnage and grade within the geological model relies on the density of drill hole\ndata, and in particular, the measurements of REE concentration in each particular stratigraphic\nzone. Where points of measurement within a zone are more than 5,000 feet apart, the\ngeological model interpolator is set to stop projecting REE concentrations. As a result, where\nthere are gaps in the interpolation, REE concentrations are set to a missing value. Given the\nconsistency/continuity of REE concentrations in a given zone, it likely that this modeling\nparameter results in lower REE concentrations than would be expected when gaps in REE\nconcentration data can be filled in through continued exploration.\nFurther, as it relates to highly carbonaceous samples, it is believed that the coal carbon matrix\ncan hinder accurate detection of REEs in samples analyzed using ICP-MS. SGS has begun to\ntest carbonaceous samples on an ash-basis, by first combusting the sample and then testing the\nresulting mineral in the ash. In assessing the impact of organic interference in the ICP-MS\nprocess, several samples tested previously on a whole rock-basis were ashed and retested on\nan ash-basis. By conducting this comparison, it is estimated that prior REE tonnages in\ncarbonaceous zones may have been underestimated by approximately 10 percent.\nMining is a high risk, capital-intensive venture and each mineral deposit is unique in its\ngeographic, social, economic, political, environmental, and geologic aspects. At the base of\nany mining project is the mineral resource itself. Potential risk factors and uncertainties in the\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 53\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\ngeologic data serving as the basis for deposit quantity and quality estimates are significant\nconsiderations when assessing the potential success of a mining project.\nGeological confidence may be considered in the framework of both the natural variability of\nthe mineral occurrence, and the uncertainty in the estimation process and data behind it. The\nmode of mineralization, mineral assemblage, geologic structure, and homogeneity naturally\nvary for each deposit. Structured variability like cyclic depositional patterns in sedimentary\nrock can be delineated mathematically with solutions like trend surface analysis or\nvariography. Unstructured variability, in the distribution of igneous rock composition, for\nexample, is more random and less predictable.\nThe reliability of mineral tonnage estimation is related to uncertainties introduced at different\nphases of exploration. An exploration program comprises several stages of progressive data\ncollection, analysis, and estimation, including:\n⦁ Geological data collection\n⦁ Geotechnical data collection\n⦁ Sampling and assaying procedures\n⦁ Bulk density determination\n⦁ Geological interpretation and modeling\n⦁ Tonnage and quality estimation\n⦁ Validation\nError may be introduced at any phase. Data acquisition and methodologies should be properly\ndocumented and subject to regular quality control and assurance protocols at all stages, from\nfield acquisition through resource estimation. Managing uncertainty requires frequent review\nof process standards, conformance, correctional action, and continuous improvement planning.\nRisk can be minimized with consistent exploration practices that provide transparent,\nbackwards traceable results that ultimately deliver admissible resource estimates for tonnage\nand quality.\nAs discussed in Sections 8.0 and 9.0, it is WEIR’s opinion that Ramaco’s methodology of data\nacquisition, record-keeping, and QA/QC protocols are adequate and reasonable for tonnage\nand grade estimation related to the REE Exploration Target.\nThe drill hole data and quality assays of REE attributes at the Brook Mine Property is\ndemonstrated to be professionally developed, well maintained, quantitative, and qualitative\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 54\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\ndata. WEIR finds no material reason, regarding geologic uncertainty, that would prohibit\nacceptably accurate estimation of mineral tonnage or grade.\n7.7 ADDITIONAL COMMODITIES OR MINERAL EQUIVALENT\nAt the time of this TRS, Ramaco is not including Scandium (Sc) in its analysis. Due to\nsampling limitations, there is not reliable analytical information on the concentration of Sc, if\nany, in the core samples.\nConcentrations of Uranium (U) and Thorium (Th), radioactive contaminants, were sampled\nduring pXRF scanning and with ICP-MS analyses. The results of both methods of analysis\nindicate these elements exist in low, unharmful quantities. The results of the more accurate\nICP-MS analyses for 613 samples showed an average of 13.6 ppm for Thorium and an average\nof 5.4 ppm for Uranium.\nIn addition to the REEs, there is subbituminous coal of interest within the REE Exploration\nTarget that would likely be extracted to obtain the REEs. Future updates upon completion of\nthe drilling program for the REE Exploration Target will likely include estimates of coal\ntonnages and qualities.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 55\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n8.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY\n8.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS, ANALYSIS, AND\nQUALITY CONTROL\nRelative to the drilling overseen by Ramaco, once 3-inch diameter core samples are obtained,\nthe cores are placed in plastic sleeves or tubing, measured and marked every two feet,\nphotographed, and logged. The sleeved cores are transferred to a cardboard core box and\nlabeled. Full core boxes are closed, secured, and transported to one of two secure storage\nlocations. At the secure locations, the full boxes are checked in and added to the secure storage\nlocation inventory. Subsequently, and at a Ramaco secure location, cores are logged by\ngeologic technicians and then reviewed by a professional geologist.\nRamaco is conducting on-site pXRF scanning. In order to prepare cores for\nsampling/scanning, the cores are dried for 24 hours, then broken into 3-inch disks. Samples\nare taken near the center of each disk. In some cases, core recovery consists of broken material.\nIn these instances, a sample of the broken material will be taken and scanned with the scanner\ndismounted from the stand.\nRamaco utilizes an Olympus Vanta handheld pXRF device and employs a three-beam scanning\nprotocol. After two feet of core have been scanned, two check samples selected are scanned,\ntwo times each. All data collected is logged and identified with the hole number and footage.\nThe pXRF scanning technology only provides reliable analysis of Lanthanum, Cerium, and\nYttrium (LaCeY). It does not detect or accurately determine the concentration levels of most\nof the remaining REEs. However, utilizing Ramaco’s ICP-MS sampling, which is an\nanalytical technique that can be used to measure elements at trace levels, a very strong\ncorrelation has been measured between LaCeY and TREE concentrations (R2 = 0.9908). Based\non the available ICP-MS sampling results, a regression of LaCeY versus TREE was prepared\nand is displayed on Figure 8.1-1.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 56\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nFigure 8.1-1 LaCeY versus TREE Regression Analysis\nGiven this relationship, Ramaco utilizes LaCeY results from its pXRF scanning as a\nrepresentative marker of areas to subject to confirmatory sampling with ICP-MS analysis.\nGenerally, ICP-MS analysis is performed where samples are extracted from pXRF scanned\nareas where LaCeY and Y concentrations are greater than 250 and 30 ppm, respectively, and\nwhere the sample is located within approximately one foot above or below clay or\ncarbonaceous clay seam boundaries. From these selected areas, a cross section sample of at\nleast 200 grams is taken. Half of the sample is retained, packaged, and returned to the core\nbox and the other half is packaged for transport to third-party laboratories.\nThird-party ICP-MS testing has been conducted at one of the laboratories listed in Table 8.1-\n2 as follows:\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 57\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nTable 8.1-2 ICP-MS Testing Laboratories\nLaboratory Contact Address\nSGS North America Inc.

The UND utilizes an ICP-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) technology for\nelemental analysis, employing microwave acid digestion in preparing samples for testing.\nThe minimum limits of detection associated with each laboratory elemental ICP-MS analysis\nare summarized in Table 8.1-1 as follows:\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 58\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nTable 8.1-2 ICP-MS Assay Minimum Limits of Detection\nMinimum Limits of Detection (ppm)\nAtomic ICP-MS ICP-OES\nSymbol Element Number SGS NETL UND\nSc Scandium 21 n/a n/a 0.050\nY Yttrium 39 0.500 4.000 3.330\nLa Lanthanum 57 0.500 0.300 0.500\nCe Cerium 58 0.500 0.060 3.330\nPr Praseodymium 59 0.100 0.050 0.020\nNd Neodymium 60 0.300 0.050 1.000\nPm Promethium 61 n/a 0.100 n/a\nSm Samarium 62 0.100 0.040 1.300\nEu Europium 63 0.050 0.020 2.600\nGd Gadolinium 64 0.100 0.040 0.500\nTb Terbium 65 0.050 0.007 0.700\nDy Dysprosium 66 0.100 0.050 0.600\nHo Holmium 67 0.050 0.007 0.800\nEr Erbium 68 0.100 0.030 0.100\nTm Thulium 69 0.050 0.007 0.080\nYb Ytterbium 70 0.100 0.010 3.330\nLu Lutetium 71 0.050 0.007 0.400\nQuality Control is generally analyzed on a 10 percent basis with certified reference materials,\nsample duplicates, Continuing Calibration Verification (CCV), and blanks.\nWEIR has determined the sample preparation, security, and analysis procedures used for the\nREE Exploration Target’s drill hole samples meet industry standards and practices for quality\ntesting, with laboratory results suitable to use for geological modeling.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 59\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n9.0 DATA VERIFICATION\n9.1 DATA VERIFICATION PROCEDURES\nRamaco provided WEIR copies of all available drilling records for its REE Exploration Target,\nwhich included Excel spreadsheets, driller’s log, field geologist’s logs, core photographs,\nquality results sheets from the REE quality laboratories, as well as drawing files or PDFs of\nthe e-logs. Each hole in the database was individually checked by WEIR against a copy of the\ndriller’s and/or geologist’s log to confirm data accuracy.\nGeological reviews performed by WEIR included:\n• Drill hole lithology database comparison to geophysical logs\n• Drill hole REE quality database comparison to quality certificates\nAfter completing the precursory verifications and validations described, the drill hole data was\nloaded into Datamine’s MineScape® Stratmodel, a geological modeling software. MineScape\nprovides robust error checking features during the initial data load, which include\nconfirmations of seam continuity, total depth versus hole header file data, interval overlap, and\nquality sample continuity with REE zones. Once the drill hole data was loaded, a stratigraphic\nmodel was created.\nFurther verifications were then possible, which included:\n• Creating cross sections through the model to visually inspect if anomalies occur due to\nmiscorrelation of seams\n• Creating structural and quality contour plots to visually check for other anomalies due\nto faulty seam elevations or quality data entry mistakes in the drill hole database\nTypical errors that may impact reserve and resource estimates relate to discrepancies in original\ndata entry, and may include:\n• Incorrect drill hole coordinates (including elevation)\n• Mislabeled drill hole lithology\n• Unnoticed erroneous quality analyses where duplicate analyses were not requested\n• Excessive drill hole core loss\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 60\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nWEIR conducted a detailed independent geological evaluation of data provided by Ramaco to\nidentify and correct errors of the nature listed above. Where errors are identified and cannot\nbe successfully resolved, it is WEIR’s policy to exclude that data from the geological model.\nBased on WEIR’s geological evaluation of data provided, nine drill holes were excluded from\nthe database due to duplicate locations. In these instances, the drill hole with the greatest depth\nand detail was retained in the model. Two drill holes were not included in the model as a result\nof the coal being on fire, and thus no meaningful logs were available.\nThe pXRF scanning technology only provides reliable analysis of Lanthanum, Cerium, and\nYttrium (LaCeY). It does not detect or accurately determine the concentration levels of most\nof the remaining REEs. As such, no pXRF data was incorporated into the geological model\nutilized in estimating REE tonnage and grade, but rather, the model relied on results of the\nICP-MS sampling analyses. All available ICP-MS sampling analyses were included in the\ndrill hole quality database.\n9.2 DATA VERIFICATION LIMITATIONS\nLimitations of data verification included incomplete or missing records for some drill holes.\nThe primary reason for this situation is incomplete data transfers upon change in property\nownership. Based on its modeling results, WEIR found some of the drill holes with incomplete\ndata, for example lacking geologist’s logfiles and/or e-logs, to be consistent with the deposit\nand appropriate to include in WEIR’s geological model.\n9.3 ADEQUACY OF DATA\nIt is WEIR’s opinion that the adequacy of sample preparation, security, and analytical\nprocedures for holes and procedures that were drilled by Ramaco after acquiring the property\nare acceptable and that these procedures meet typical industry standards. Ramaco employs\ndetailed process and procedures, described in Section 8.0 that are followed each time a core\nhole is to be sampled. The geologist’s logs for these holes contain sampling descriptions and\nlithologic descriptions that are sufficiently detailed to ascertain that an experienced geologist\nsupervised the drilling and sampling. Ramaco REE quality analyses are performed by the\nNETL, SGS, or UND to ASTM standards, as detailed in Section 8.0.\nThe adequacy of sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are generally\nunknown for drill holes that were drilled prior to Ramaco acquiring the property in 2011.\nHowever, the geologist’s logs for these holes contain sampling descriptions and lithologic\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 61\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\ndescriptions that are sufficiently detailed to ascertain that an experienced geologist supervised\nthe drilling and sampling. All REE quality analyses have been performed since Ramaco’s\nacquisition of the property and these analyses have followed the procedures detailed in Section\n8.0. The legacy drill hole information was not used for REE quality analyses, however, the\ndrill holes were used for coal seam structure and thickness modeling. Model verifications\nfurther support WEIR’s high level of confidence that a representative, valid, and accurate drill\nhole database and geological model have been generated for the REE Exploration Target that\ncan be relied upon to estimate REE tonnage to an accuracy that is acceptable for this report’s\nspecified standards.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 62\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n10.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING\nMineral processing of mined coal and REEs related to this Exploration Target has not yet been\ndefined.\n[The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank]\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 63\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n11.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nExploration Target tonnage estimates reported are not Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves,\nand do not meet the threshold for reserve modifying factors, such as estimated economic\nviability, that would allow for conversion to Mineral Reserves.

This TRS is based on\nRamaco controlling, by lease or ownership, or having the ability to acquire the REE resources\nand surface lands necessary to support its mine plans.\nThe ability of Ramaco, or any mining company, to achieve production and financial projections\nis dependent on numerous factors. These factors primarily include site-specific geological\nconditions, the capabilities of management and mine personnel, level of success in acquiring\nreserves and surface properties, mineral sales prices and market conditions, environmental\nissues, securing permits and bonds, and developing and operating mines in a safe and efficient\nmanner. Unforeseen changes in legislation and new industry developments could substantially\nalter the performance of any mining company.\nMining is carried out in an environment where not all events are predictable. While an effective\nmanagement team can identify known risks and take measures to manage and/or mitigate these\nrisks, there is still the possibility of unexpected and unpredictable events occurring. It is not\npossible therefore to totally remove all risks or state with certainty that an event that may have\na material impact will not occur.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 74\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n22.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nSince 2019, Ramaco has been exploring the potential of a REE deposit within its Brook Mine\nProperty. Each successive exploration program since then has added continued definition of\nthe deposit. While the current exploration program is ongoing, as of March 21, 2024, there is\nsufficient data to clearly define the Brook Mine Property REE Exploration Target.\nThe Brook Mine Property Exploration Target in-place TREO tonnage (excluding BREO) as of\nMarch 21, 2024, ranges from 1,105 to 1,382 thousand tons and the average grade ranges from\n392 to 490 ppm on an ash-basis. The PMREE and SMREE are estimated to represent 23.5 and\n6.5 percent of the TREOs, respectively. While REOs exist in both the coal and interburden\nzones modeled, the REOs are concentrated to a higher degree within the interburdens, with\napproximately 60 percent of the estimated REO tonnage located within clay and siltstone\nformations.\nThis TRS also includes estimation of Gallium (Ga) and Germanium (Ge) in-place tonnage.\nAlthough Ramaco has performed only 496 analyses so far (for each element), early estimates\nindicate that combined in-place oxide tonnage ranges from 114K to 143K tons, with combined\noxide grade ranging from 47 to 59 ppm on an ash-basis. This constitutes approximately 10\npercent of the TREO tonnage. When combining Ga and Ge with REO’s, the deposit has a range\nof 1,220 to 1,525 thousand tons, with concentrations ranging from 439 to 548 ppm.\nRamaco’s sample collection, preparation, security, and testing protocols are well documented\nand suffice to provide consistent, reliable, and verifiable data.\nAs with any exploration state mineral mining project, there are risks and uncertainties\nassociated with TREO tonnage and grade estimates. While existing drill hole density provides\nstrong confidence in structural modeling, continued ICP-MS testing will necessarily fill-in\nexisting gaps in the modeling of REO concentrations.\nRegardless of the care taken in defining this Exploration Target, tonnage estimates reported\nthroughout this TRS are not Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and do not meet the\nthreshold for reserve modifying factors that would allow for conversion to Mineral Reserves.\nThere is no certainty that any part of the Exploration Target tonnage estimates will be\nconverted into Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 75\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n23.0 RECOMMENDATIONS\nRamaco has indicated it intends to continue its REE exploration efforts throughout areas of the\nBrook Mine Property, beyond the existing permit area which serves as the boundary for this\nExploration Target. In continuing its exploration programs, Ramaco should consider the\nfollowing:\n• Continue to employ an experienced geologist to log core holes, measure core recovery,\nand complete sampling.\n• Maintain current practices on core drilling, chain of custody, sample collection,\npreparation, security, pXRF scanning, ICP-MS testing, and geological modeling.\n• Utilize the existing geological model to assist in targeting areas with low REE\nconcentration data coverage within a stratigraphic zone.\n• Geophysically log drill holes to verify strata and thickness.\n• Continued testing to evaluate REE mineralogical associations and extraction methods\n• Continued design and study of a techno-economic model to assess deposit economics\nMarch 21, 2024 Page 76\nTechnical Report Summary\nBrook Mine Property - Rare Earth Element Exploration Target\nPrepared for Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n24.0 REFERENCES\nReferences used in preparation of this TRS are as follows:\n• A Geo-Data Science Method for Assessing Unconventional Rare-Earth Element\nResources in Sedimentary Systems, National Resources Research, 2023\n• Towards A Geo-Data Science Method for Assessing Rare-Earth Element and Critical\nMineral Occurrences in Coal and Other Sedimentary Systems, National Energy\nTechnology Laboratory, July 22, 2021\n• Seredin, V.

          "content": "PLEASE SEE THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOLLOWING THIS LETTER\nMarch 21, 2024\nDear Shareholders,\nAlmost a year ago in May 2023, I wrote you with the announcement that we had\nmade a unique discovery at our Brook Mine (“Brook”) near Sheridan, Wyoming. Based\non initial testing, Ramaco and our partners at the Department of Energy’s National\nEnergy Technology Laboratory (“NETL”) have concluded that Brook contains the\nlargest unconventional deposit of rare earth elements (“REEs”) discovered to date in the\nUnited States. Given REE’s strategic importance and significant economic value this\nrepresented a singular potential opportunity for Ramaco.\nWe have made significant progress over the past year. Attention both to the\nBrook mine and the initial findings was widely publicized, most prominently in a Wall\nStreet Journal article in November. What has not been widely discussed is what we\nhave been doing over the past year. There has been tremendous effort to advance the\ntesting and diligence necessary to assess and advance Ramaco’s progress toward\ncommercialization of both the REEs, as well as other newly discovered critical minerals\nat Brook.\nWe began our efforts to determine the dimensions of this rare earth opportunity\nin 2019 after being informed by NETL that their testing had indicated the presence of\nunusually high levels of magnetic REEs in about 6 core samples we had provided them.\nToday, we now have data from over 575 core holes and 1,900 mineral samples we have\ntested. We continue to drill, test and analyze. However, based on the results of that data\nwe now have reached a stage of critical mass where we feel that the Brook mine project\nhas the potential to become one of, if not the first, new commercial rare earth project to\nbe able to move forward in the United States.\nToday we are publishing the interim geological update by our independent\nreserve geologist, Weir International, Inc. (“Weir”) of their Target Exploration Report\n(“Report”). This updates the original report prepared by Weir in May 2023. Together\nwith this new Report and this letter we are addressing:\n1) What steps have been taken to advance and minimize the risks of\ndevelopment,\n2) What our test results have revealed to date,\n3) What steps we will be taking in the future to attain commercialization, and\n4) Some preliminary structural and financial options.\n1\nI. Key Findings Regarding the REE and Critical Mineral Deposit\nFirst, to summarize the principal test findings of the Report:\n• Since May 2023 substantial additional drilling and testing has occurred in the\ncurrent permit area at maximum depths of approximately 200’. Testing was done\nat the independent labs of SGS North America Inc. The results indicate that the\nreported high end REE volume estimate has increased by 90% to ~1.5 million tons\n(inclusive of two new critical minerals - germanium and gallium) with average\nparts per million (“ppm”) concentration grades of ~550 ppm.\n• This almost doubles both the tonnage volume estimate and concentrations reported\nlast May.\nBrook Mine In-Place REO Exploration Target Tonnage ('000) and Grade (ppm) Estimate\nTotal Primary Secondary Heavy Light Ga and Ge\nRange\nTons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade Tons Grade\nLow 1,220 439 260 93 72 26 39 14 853 301 114 47\nHigh 1,525 548 325 116 90 32 49 17 1,066 377 143 59\n• A number of material lithologies showed maximum ppm concentrations exceeding\n9,000 ppm. Indeed, coal showed the highest concentrations with almost a ~10,000\nmaximum ppm with an ~1,800 average ppm.\n2\n• The testing results reported in May 2023, reflected that only 3% of the deposit\nhad concentrations in excess of 300 ppm. Based upon our continued and more\nextensive testing since last year, the data now reflect that approximately 90% of\nthe deposit exceeds 300 ppm with an average concentration of ~550 ppm.\n100%\n90%\n90%\n80%\n67%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20% 14% 13%\n7%\n10% 2%0% 1%0% 1%0% 2%0% 0% 3% 0%\n0%\n>2000 1000-2000 750-1000 500-750 400-500 300-400 200-300 <200\nMar-24 May-23\n• The deposit has been found to contain unusually large quantities and concentrations\nof two high value critical minerals named germanium and gallium. China recently\nimposed export bans on both. Current preliminary tests indicate a volume of\n~150,000 tons of these two minerals at a high concentration of roughly 60 ppm. For\nreference, the United States consumes roughly 200 tons annually of these minerals\nand the average concentration is roughly 20 ppm.\n• A significant number of additional samples and data have been tested, with data\nincluded from older drill logs going back decades. In sum, to date 576 drill holes\nhave been tested with over 1,900 ICP-MS tests on recent samples.\nBrook Mine Drilling & Analysis Summary\nDrill Holes XRF Analysis ICP-MS Analysis\nExploration Program Count Total Depth (Ft) Holes Samples Feet Holes Samples Feet\nBighorn Coal Drilling 417 81,083 - - - - - -\nRamaco Coal Drilling 36 7,700 - - - - - -\n2019 Drilling 6 1,132 3 125 74 5 115 74\n2021-2022 Drilling 14 1,937 14 2,196 549 14 252 228\n2022-2023 Drilling 102 21,593 94 26,173 6,661 94 1,585 1,404\nDeep Drilling 1 856 0 0 0 0 0 0\nTotal 576 114,301 111 28,494 7,284 113 1,952 1,707\n• For this Report, the ICP-MS testing was conducted on an “ash basis” for a\nsignificant number of samples where the testing protocol combusted the organic\ncarbon material (like coal) before testing.\n3\n• The average ppm concentration across all lithologies tested on an ash basis\nshowed roughly an 80% increase in concentration to ~550 ppm since the May 2023\nreported test results.\n• The predominant material where REE tonnage is found was clay, carbonaceous\nmaterial and claystone with 53%, with coal comprising roughly 70,000 tons or 5%.\nEstimated In-Place TREO+G Tons By Lithology\nTREO Tons\nLithology ('000s) (High End of Range) %\nCarbonaceous Material 282.4 19%\nClay/Silt 267.9 18%\nClaystone 248.5 16%\nCoal 70.1 5%\nCoal_Mixed 3.3 0%\nShale 87.1 6%\nSandstone 239.7 16%\nScoria 199.3 13%\nUnconsolidated 49.5 3%\nNot_Logged 59.7 4%\nOther 17.3 1%\nGrand Total 1,524.8 100%\n• The following table and graph set forth the volumetric distribution percentage,\ncurrent price per ton and estimated tonnage of the Brook primary and secondary\nmagnetic REE elements, including germanium and gallium.\n4\nBrook Mine ICP Analysis\nREO Mine REOs $/Ton Value Est.

They have a current “basket price “of over\n$140,000 per ton. When all other less valuable light and heavy element REEs are\nincluded in the basket the value declines to approximately $56,000 per ton.\nEstimated tREO+ Distribution\nTm2O3, 0.17% Y2O3, 11.96% Yb2O3, 1.28% Nd2O3,\n14.68%\nLu2O3, 0.17% Pr6O11, 3.99%\nDy2O3, 2.23%\nTb4O7, 0.39%\nSm2O3, 2.85%\nLa2O3, 15.93%\nGd2O3, 2.59%\nGa2O3,\nHo2O3, 0.44%\nEr2O3, 1.22% 9.28%\nEu2O3, 0.59% CeO2, 31.05% GeO2, 1.19%\n5\nII. Where We Are Now\nAs I wrote last May, the REE business is fundamentally an industrial chemical\nbusiness. Basically, it is “rare” that these elements and critical minerals are found in\nsufficient concentration to be economically mined, extracted, separated, and then\nultimately refined to be used in the multitude of electronic forms of applications.\nWe have now undertaken a number of preliminary steps toward the commercial\ndevelopment of the Brook Mine REE deposit. Although this is still a work in progress,\nthrough our extensive testing to date we are confident that the Brook mine REE deposit\nis now both sufficiently large and concentrated that it could become the first new rare\nearth project to reach commercial development in this country. What we have\nestablished at this stage are:\n• This deposit stands out due to its above-average concentrations of\nmagnetic rare earth elements, including terbium and dysprosium, for\nwhich there is currently no domestic source of production,\n• The deposit is of immense volumetric size both in terms of REEs and the\ncritical minerals germanium and gallium,\n• Ramaco owns the mineral deposit, which is on private not federal land,\n• Ramaco has already permitted the mine, initiated mining last year, and\nhas completed its first cut to remove overburden near surface ore zones to\ngather bulk sample data in preparation for further mining and pilot\noperations over the coming months,\n• The deposit shows concentration levels which we believe would be\neconomically feasible to extract, separate and refine, and which we expect\nwill be further validated in a subsequent techno-economic analysis,\n• The deposit lacks the radioactive elements typically associated with hard\nrock rare earth deposits, which is a major advantage for both\nenvironmental and economic processing, and\n• Ramaco is financially and operationally capable of developing the assets.\nWith that as an overview, there are a few matters I'd like to highlight. We had a\nshift in our reporting methodology from the May 2023 Weir report. We now present\nrare earth element concentrations on an “ash” basis. This basically means the organic\nmaterial is combusted before the mineral is ICP-MS tested. When the organic carbon is\nburned off, what is left is mineral matter containing rare earth elements, increasing the\nconcentration, but not the tonnage of the deposit.\nOur initial testing protocol was performed on a “whole rock” basis which was\nconsistent with conventional hard mineral REE deposits. It did not however account for\nthe unconventional nature of the Brook deposit. Our REEs are found in coal and carbon\n6\nconcentrated deposits and not in hard minerals, which is the source of most other REEs\ncurrently being mined.\nThe result is that the reporting on an “ash” basis increased the reported\nconcentration levels significantly. As an example, a sample with a 200 part per million\n(ppm) concentration in a deposit with 5% ash would find its concentration level\nincreased 20x on an “ash” basis to say 4,000 ppm. Additionally, by not ashing the\nsamples prior to testing, it has been found and documented in academic literature (and\nby SGS) that the dissolved carbon in the sample can interfere with ICP-MS analysis and\nmask the true concentration of the rare earth elements, potentially by as much as 10%.\nTo date we have ICP-MS retested roughly 3-5% of the ~1900 samples. We are in\nthe process of both testing the remainder of the samples, as well as retesting existing\ncoal core zones where the organic matter may have “masked” the mineral readings. We\nexpect the results of this will ultimately show even greater quantities and\nconcentrations than we have reported here.\nThis adjustment is pivotal as it will enable us to focus on high concentration\nzones within coal and highly carbonaceous clays and siltstones. By reporting\nconcentrations on the mineral matter itself rather than including the organic portion, we\nprovide a more accurate representation of the feedstock for processing. This approach\nallows for better comparison with hard rock REE deposits and ensures a clearer\nunderstanding of the true potential of our resource.\nAlthough we have already performed a great deal of drilling and testing this will\nbe an on-going component of the development. We have tested only a third of the\noverall property and at shallow depths. We recently completed a deep core to ~900 feet\nwhich we are in the process of testing. As we delve deeper into coring the overall\ndeposit and enhance our sampling techniques, we anticipate further increase in both\ntonnage and concentration, particularly in coal zones previously bypassed due to\ninstrument calibration.\nFurthermore, our exploration efforts have unveiled single point concentrations\nnearing 10,000 ppm Total Rare Earth Oxides (“TREO”), including gallium and\ngermanium, within several lithologies. These lithologies are contained within the 25%\nof our deposit that is considered to be coal and carbonaceous material. With ongoing\nsampling initiatives, we foresee a considerable increase in both concentration and\ntonnage within these high-grade rock types.\nIII. Next Steps\nAt this point our next development steps will involve the commencement of REE\nextraction testing through a number of sequential digestion methodologies. Sequential\ndigestion is the process of subjecting the ore samples to multiple types of reagents. The\n7\namount of REE that is extracted with that specific reagent tells you about the types of\nminerals the REEs are associated with.\nWe expect that this approach will allow us to elucidate the mineralogical\nassociations of REEs within our ore and identify the most economical leaching methods.\nSequential digestion will provide valuable insights into the complex geological makeup\nof our coal zones and will aid in our efforts to optimize our processing strategies for\nmaximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nAlongside sequential digestion, we are embarking on comprehensive tests to\nidentify mechanical and physical concentrating techniques suitable for processing our\nore on a commercially feasible basis. These techniques encompass grinding, density and\ngravity separations, visual separations, and magnetic separations. By employing these\nmethods, we aim to enhance the concentration of rare earth elements before initiating\nany chemical leaching processes. To ensure the efficacy of our approach, we will\nconduct full mineralogical analyses utilizing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM) to refine our options and with the objective of optimizing\nthe extraction process.\nAfter we have performed multiple sequential digestion tests on our primary\nmineralized lithologies, we can optimize the steps to be as simple and economic as\npossible. In parallel, in addition to \"hydrometallurgical\" approaches like sequential\nextraction, and in collaboration with our NETL partners, we are also exploring both\nconventional and unconventional processing techniques. These innovative approaches\nhave the potential to revolutionize rare earth element extraction, offering increased\nefficiency and reduced environmental impact.\nWe are also diligently constructing an internal techno-economic model to guide\nour decision-making processes. This comprehensive model will facilitate the\ndetermination of cutoff grades, enable economic and financial simulations, and identify\nkey variables impacting a financial valuation. Based on data being developed we expect\nto have this complete internally by later this year which will be independently reviewed\nand validated by SRK Consulting, our third-party consultant.\nWe are also finding that there could be significant concentrations of REEs at\nrelatively shallow depths that we might be able to mine at an early stage to provide\ninitial revenue. Interestingly, there also appear to be even greater concentrations of\nREEs at deeper levels that we need to further investigate that might be accessed by\nsome form of in-situ injection mining. This technique already has applications in\ncopper and uranium mining but, has never been applied to coal-based REEs. However,\nmuch planning and analysis must be done before conclusions concerning mine\nplanning and the ultimate approach can be reached.\nIn addition to sequential digestion of our core samples, we are continuing our\ngeological analysis which involves a meticulous correlation of high-grade core samples\n8\nwith geophysical well logs. By identifying key variables driving high concentration\ndeposition, we aim to unravel the complex geological processes that have shaped the\nBrook deposit.\nThis integrated approach has already yielded some promising results, as we\nuncover important trends and delineate high-grade zones essential for targeted\nextraction. This work will be critical in selecting the mining method(s) most appropriate\nfor the Brook deposit, either by conventional surface or highwall mining or perhaps\nusing underground in-situ mining techniques.\nAs mentioned above, prior to leaching ore, we believe that it will be imperative\nto separate non-ore minerals from the ore through physical concentration. This process\nis essential for maximizing extraction efficiency. To facilitate the high volume of sample\nneeded, we are in the process of drilling specific boreholes to extract ample material\nfrom three of our highest-grade ore zones. These bulk samples will enable us to conduct\ncomprehensive mechanical concentration tests, with the goal of optimizing our\nprocesses for maximum yield.\nFollowing the optimization of physical concentration and sequential digestion,\nour attention will turn to the extraction of dissolved REEs from the highly concentrated\nleachate. We are exploring various extraction techniques, including advanced solvent\nextraction, ion exchange, and organic ligands, to identify the most cost-effective and\nenvironmentally benign method. We expect that whatever extraction technique we\nultimately decide to implement will likely be a closed loop system with minimal waste\ngeneration. Collaborating with industry experts, we will select the optimal approach\nbased on rigorous testing and techno-economic modeling.\nAs we progress through laboratory-scale testing, we remain committed to the\nobjectives of ensuring scalability, sustainability, and efficiency. After successfully\ndeveloping a mineral processing flowsheet based on laboratory testing, our next\nmilestone involves transitioning to pilot production on-site, where we will refine our\nprocess flowsheet using bulk samples obtained from mining. We expect that this\niterative approach will allow us to fine-tune our operations and maximize the\ncommercial value of our rare earth deposits.\nWe hope to complete our techno economic and pilot plant design within 2024.\nWe would then move from lab scale work to initial pilot plant development,\nconstruction, and production which we expect will begin in 2025.\nIn the pilot plant phase, our primary objectives would be to validate the\nproduction flowsheet derived from laboratory testing, ensure the integrated operation\nof physical concentrating, leaching, and processing the REEs from leachate. This would\nallow us to adapt and refine production and separation processes, thereby mitigating\ndesign and capital risks for full-scale implementation.\n9\nUpon successful demonstration of continuous feed and stabilized product\nquality at the pilot-scale, the transition would be made to full-scale production. The\ntimeframe for scaling to full production from pilot production will depend on a variety\nof factors such as the complexity of the final processing flowsheet, the availability of\nresources, and any regulatory requirements.\nThis transition will necessitate the addition of more circuits and equipment to the\npilot facility in order to accommodate higher ore volumes as we scale from processing a\nfew tons to many tons per day. Depending on the complexity of the processing and ore\nvariability, the scale-up phase to full commercial production could span multiple\nmonths and involve several crucial steps.\nAs a first step, the equipment used in the pilot plant must be assessed for its\nscalability, ensuring that it can handle the increased volume while maintaining\nefficiency as the processing goes from a few tons to many tons per day.\nSimilarly, the scaling up leaching circuits and solvent extraction processes poses\nadditional challenges. Leaching processes involve extracting rare earth elements from\nthe feedstock. It uses chemical solutions, which require careful control of reaction\nconditions such as temperature, pH, and reagent concentrations and environmental and\nregulatory compliance.\nIn general, scaling from a pilot plant to full production can take well over a year.\nAssuming a successful pilot plant launch, we would hope to begin possible commercial\nproduction sometime in 2026.\nIV. Future Structural and Financial Options\nWe will devote a great deal of thoughtful analysis as to how to develop these\nunique and valuable rare earth and mineral assets. In parallel, we will also explore the\ncorporate structure and financial arrangements most likely to maximize long term\nshareholder value. At this stage, we believe that we have established that we have a\nworld class REE and critical mineral deposit with sufficient mineral concentration to\nmerit the probability of a successful commercial development.\nAs discussed in this letter there are numerous chemical, metallurgical,\nmineralogy and mining milestones we will be pursuing in the months ahead. As noted\nwe will continue testing and techno-economic analysis this year with the expectation of\nbeginning pilot facility development in 2025. It is our expectation that by some point in\n2026 we will transition our pilot operations and reach the ability to launch a commercial\nproduction operation at initial scale.\nOver the coming months in 2024 we hope to develop the techno-economic\nanalysis to provide visibility on what would be the financial metrics and capital\n10\nrequirements necessary to pursue this unique business opportunity. Critical mineral\ndevelopment is very different from the metallurgical coal business, but it also has\nsimilar characteristics.\nOur core stewardship of Ramaco is to add maximum shareholder value to long\nterm holders of our stock. Critical mineral companies in general and rare earth\ncompanies in particular, trade at multiples far exceeding those of any coal group.\nWe believe that the investment necessary to commercialize this asset is within\nboth our operational and financial capabilities. This is especially so as our metallurgical\noperations mature in a few years at a higher level of production with correspondingly\nhigher levels of cash flow generation. The REE and critical mineral business may\npresent an extremely rewarding additional new direction for Ramaco.\nOnce we understand the capital and operational requirements to develop this\nnew REE business we can more logically assess how this unique opportunity should be\npursued both structurally and financially. One option would be to internally fund the\ninvestment from Ramaco’s own growing financial resources. Ramaco would then\noperate two lines of business, both in the critical minerals field- one in metallurgical\ncoal and the other in rare earths. Alternatively, Ramaco could spin off its rare earth\noperating business into a new separate vehicle as a standalone company, perhaps with\nexternal funding and still maintain a royalty position in the REE and minerals mined\nthrough our METCB shares.\nAs expected in any endeavor of this magnitude, there are intricate pros and cons\nto each approach. There may also be other promising and novel approaches that we\nhave not yet contemplated. We will study all alternatives carefully and of course seek\nand consider thoughtful counsel on all aspects as we proceed.\nOur guiding principle will be what is in the best interest for building long-term\nvalue for our shareholders.\nAll the best-\nRandall W.

Business\nRamaco Resources, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our Class A and Class B common\nstock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols “METC” and “METCB,” respectively. Our\n9.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n“METCL”. Our principal corporate offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky. As used herein, “Ramaco Resources,”\n“Ramaco,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” and similar terms include Ramaco Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries,\nunless the context indicates otherwise.\nGeneral\nWe are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and\nsouthwestern Virginia. We are a pure play metallurgical coal company with 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million\nmeasured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. We believe our advantaged reserve geology\nprovides us with higher productivity and industry-leading lower cash costs.\nOur development portfolio primarily includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and\nMaben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the\nlowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel\nmills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near\nSheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements as well\nas the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nOur operations include six active mines at our Elk Creek mining complex (the “Elk Creek Complex”), three\nactive mines at our Berwind mining complex (the “Berwind Complex”), two active mines at our Knox Creek mining\ncomplex (the “Knox Creek Complex”), and one active mine at our Maben mining complex (the “Maben Complex”).\n4\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment of the Elk Creek Complex commenced in 2016 and included the construction of a preparation\nplant and rail load-out facilities. The Elk Creek property consists of approximately 20,200 acres of controlled mineral\nrights and contains approximately 16 seams that we have targeted for production. Expansion of the Elk Creek\npreparation plant occurred during 2022 and 2023 in order to increase production.\nDevelopment of the Berwind Complex began in late 2017. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind\nComplex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. In early-2021, as pricing and\ndemand improved, Berwind development was restarted. We successfully reached the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam in\nlate 2021. The Berwind property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled mineral rights, including the\nDecember 2021 acquisition of “Amonate Assets” from subsidiaries of Coronado Global Resources Inc. (“Coronado”) in\n2021. The Amonate Assets include a processing plant located in our Berwind Complex, saving us transportation costs to\nour Knox Creek plant 26 miles away. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event in 2022 that resulted in idling\nmining operations for one of the active mines. Production restarted for the idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nOur Knox Creek Complex includes a preparation plant and 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights that we\nexpect to develop in the future. The Knox Creek preparation plant processed some coal from our Berwind Complex in\n2023 as well as coal purchased from third parties.\nThe Maben Coal acquisition in 2022 provides the Company with 28,000 leased acres of controlled mineral\nrights, which includes coal deposits that may be mined currently by surface and high wall mining methods as well as\ndeveloped in the future through deep mining.\nOur RAM Mine property is located in southwestern Pennsylvania. Following years of delays, the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Environmental Protection issued a denial of the RAM Mine permit. While the Company believes that the\nRAM permit was denied incorrectly and capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus\non our other core properties and monetize these assets at the appropriate time.\nOur Brook Mine property consists of approximately 16,000 acres of controlled mineral rights and a research\nand development facility that were acquired as part of the purchase of Ramaco Coal in 2022. The mine is currently\nundergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of rare earth elements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our estimated aggregate annual production capacity is just under four million clean\ntons of coal. We plan to complete development of our existing properties and increase annual production over the next\nfew years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal annually, subject to market conditions,\npermitting, and additional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute\nto our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.\nMetallurgical Coal Industry\nMetallurgical coal, also known as “met coal “ or “coking coal,” is a key component of the blast furnace\nsteelmaking process and, therefore, demand for such coal is highly correlated with conditions in the steel industry. The\nmetallurgical coal global market has grown steadily in recent years and is expected to continue to do so over the next\nfew years.\nUnited States metallurgical coal mines are primarily located in the Appalachian area of the eastern U.S.\nImported metallurgical coal has historically been uneconomic due to transportation costs and availability of domestic\nsupply. Metallurgical coal is transported to domestic customers by truck, rail, barge and vessel. Metallurgical coal\ncontracts in North America are typically 12-month, calendar year contracts where both prices and volumes are fixed.\nThese contracts are normally negotiated and entered into during the third and fourth quarters of the preceding calendar\nyear.\nU.S. metallurgical coal is also exported to the seaborne market and sold to buyers in Europe, South America,\nAfrica, and Asia. U.S. metallurgical coal exports are primarily sold to buyers in the Atlantic Basin market (customers in\nEurope, Brazil and Africa), and serve as swing supply to buyers in the Pacific Basin (customers in India, South Korea,\n5\nTable of Contents\nJapan and China). U.S. metallurgical coal exports compete with Australian metallurgical coals that are generally\nproduced at a lower cost but are geographically disadvantaged to the Atlantic Basin. Conversely, Australian production\nhas a much shorter logistical route to Pacific Basin customers. Any supply shortfall out of Australia, or increase in global\ndemand beyond Australia’s capacity, has historically been serviced by U.S. and Canadian metallurgical coal producers.\nExport metallurgical coal pricing is determined utilizing a series of indices from a number of independent\nsources and is adjusted for coal quality. Contracted export volumes have terms that vary in duration from spot cargoes\nto one year, rarely exceeding one year. In some cases, indices are used to calculate pricing at the point that the coal\nchanges hands. In other cases, an average value of indices over time may be utilized. While the term “benchmark” is\nstill utilized, it too is determined based on index values, typically for the preceding three months.\nMetallurgical coals are generally classified as high, medium or low-volatile (“vol”). Volatiles are products,\nother than water, that are released as gas or vapor when coal is converted to coke. Carbon is the primary element that\nremains when the volatiles are released.\nOur Strategy\nOur business strategy is to increase stockholder value through sustained earnings growth, cash flow generation\nand dividends by:\nDeveloping and Operating Our Metallurgical Coal Properties. We have 59 million reserve tons and 1,119\nmillion measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal with attractive quality characteristics\nacross high-volatility and low-volatility segments. This geologically advantaged resource and reserve base allows for\nflexible capital spending in challenging market conditions.\nWe plan to complete development of our existing properties and increase annual production over the next few\nyears to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting, and\nadditional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute to our focus on\nadvantaged geology and lower costs.\nBeing a Low-Cost U.S. Producer of Metallurgical Coal. Our reserve base presents advantaged geologic\ncharacteristics such as relatively thick coal seams at the deep mines, a low effective mining ratio at the surface mines,\nand desirable metallurgical coal quality. These characteristics contribute to a production profile that has a cash cost of\nproduction that is significantly below most U.S. metallurgical coal producers.\nMaintaining a Conservative Capital Structure and Prudently Managing the Business for the Long Term. We are\ncommitted to maintaining a conservative capital structure with a reasonable amount of debt that will afford us the\nfinancial flexibility to execute our business strategies on an ongoing basis.\nEnhancing Coal Purchase Opportunities. Depending on market conditions, we purchase coal from other\nindependent producers. Purchased coal is complementary from a blending standpoint with our produced coals or it may\nalso be sold as an independent product.\nDemonstrating Excellence in Safety and Environmental Stewardship. We are committed to complying with\nboth regulatory and our high standards for environmental and employee health and safety requirements. We believe that\nbusiness excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\nAdvancing our Initiatives in Rare Earth Elements and Advanced Carbon Products. We are also focused on\ncritical mineral rare earth development as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and\nmaterials. These initiatives provide additional growth opportunities and upside potential in future periods.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Projects\nOur properties are primarily located in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, southwestern\nPennsylvania, and northeastern Wyoming. The following map shows the location of our mining complexes and projects,\nexcluding our properties located in Pennsylvania and Wyoming:\nElk Creek Mining Complex\nOur Elk Creek Complex in southern West Virginia began production in late December 2016. The Elk Creek\nproperty consists of approximately 20,200 acres of controlled mineral rights and contains 16 seams that we believe are\neconomically mineable. Nearly all our seams contain high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal accessible at or above\ndrainage. Additionally, almost all of this coal is high-fluidity, which is an important factor for high-volatile metallurgical\ncoal.\nWe control the majority of the coal and related mining rights within the existing permitted areas and our current\nmine plans, as well as the surface for our surface facilities, through lease agreements with McDonald Land Company\namong others. We estimate that the Elk Creek Complex contains reserves capable of yielding approximately 28 million\n7\nTable of Contents\ntons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated metallurgical coal resource tons of 215\nmillion. We estimate that the mine life for the Elk Creek Complex is over 20 years.\nWe currently market most of the coal produced from the Elk Creek Complex as a blended high-volatile A/B\nproduct. When segregated, a portion of our coal can be sold as a high-volatile A product for a premium. Our market for\nElk Creek production is principally North American coke and steel producers. We also market our coal to European,\nSouth American, Asian and African customers, and occasionally to coal traders and brokers for use in filling orders for\ntheir blended products. Additionally, we seek to market a portion of our coal in the specialty coal markets that value low\nash content.\nWe process our Elk Creek coal production through the preparation plant located on-site at the complex, which\nhas a heavy-media vessel, large-diameter heavy-media cyclone, dual-stage spiral concentrators, froth flotation,\nhorizontal vibratory and screen bowl centrifuges. Our rail load-out facilities at Elk Creek are served by the CSX railroad;\nhowever, we also have the ability to develop on controlled property a rail-loading facility on the Norfolk Southern\nrailroad, which would facilitate dual rail service. We have not yet committed capital for the development of a Norfolk\nSouthern rail facility.\nThe combined refuse capacity at the active disposal areas is expected to provide over 20 years of disposal life\nfor our operations with additional refuse areas being permitted. We completed construction of a full complement of plate\npresses during 2020 to allow for dewatering of material which then was being pumped as slurry to our impoundment.\nThis equipment allows us to process all waste material for placement in areas designed for combined refuse disposal and\nmaximize the life for disposal of fine waste rock in the pool of the impoundment.\nA large portion of our controlled reserves are permitted through existing, issued permits, and we continue\nactively pursuing multiple new permits.\nOn January 3, 2020, we entered into a mineral lease with the McDonald Land Company for coal reserves\nwhich, in many cases, are located immediately adjacent to our Elk Creek Complex. This leased property became\navailable after the former base lease with another party was terminated. The prior lessee, who controlled the property\nsince 1978, did not produce commercial amounts of coal from the property during their possession of the lease. While it\nis unusual to have a metallurgical reserve in this part of Central Appalachia remain idle for such an extended period of\ntime, the configuration and location of the tracts lend themselves to be mined and processed far more efficiently from\nour Elk Creek property. The McDonald reserves have the same geologic advantages and low costs that are being\nexperienced in our Elk Creek mines.\nDuring 2022, we began work on a throughput upgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. The upgrade, which\nwas completed in 2023, increased our annual processing capacity for this complex to approximately three million tons\nper year. In order to utilize the increased capacity, we also began development work on additional low-cost, high-\nvolatile mines at Elk Creek, which began production during 2022.\nBerwind Mining Complex\nOur Berwind Complex is located on the border of West Virginia and Virginia and is well-positioned to fill the\nanticipated market for low-volatile coals. The Berwind property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled\nmineral rights, including the Amonate acquisition. We estimate that the Berwind Complex contains reserves capable of\nyielding approximately 23 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated\nmetallurgical coal resource tons of 629 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Berwind Complex is over\n20 years. We view Berwind as the second flagship complex for Ramaco.\nDevelopment of our Berwind Complex began in late 2017 in the thinner Pocahontas No. 3 seam and has since\nsloped up to current mining in the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind\nComplex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the economic effects of COVID-19. In early 2021, as\npricing and demand improved, Berwind development resumed, and we successfully reached the Pocahontas No. 4 seam\n8\nTable of Contents\nin late 2021. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event during the third quarter of 2022 that resulted in idling\nmining operations for one of the active mines. Production restarted for the idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe have the necessary permits for the Berwind Complex for our current and budgeted operations. A permit for\nour Squire Jim seam room-and-pillar underground mine was issued in 2020 and contains a large area of Squire Jim seam\ncoal deposits. The Squire Jim seam of coal is the lowest known coal seam on the geologic column in this region, and due\nto the depth of cover has never been significantly explored. At this point, we do not anticipate activating this mining\npermit.\nIn December 2021, we acquired the Amonate Assets from Coronado, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement.\nThe acquisition included a mine complex located in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia\nadjacent and contiguous to the Company’s existing Berwind Complex. The assets primarily consist of high-quality, low\nand mid-volatile metallurgical coal reserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s Berwind\nComplex. Also purchased were several additional permitted mines and an idled 1.3 million ton per annum capacity coal\npreparation plant with a rail loading facility.\nWe began mine development on the Amonate Assets shortly after acquisition, and production began in the first\nquarter of 2022. The preparation plant and rail loading facility were refurbished in 2022 and began operation in the\nfourth quarter of 2022. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nKnox Creek Mining Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights as well as a\npreparation plant, a coal-loading facility, and a refuse impoundment. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nThe Tiller Mine slope face-up and shafts were idled before our acquisition of the property. The Company has\nspent limited amounts of capital to review the feasibility of a high-vol A metallurgical deep mine in the Jawbone seam of\ncoal. This seam is located slightly above the Tiller Seam and would be accessed via a short slope from within the\nexisting Tiller seam mine. Jawbone coal could flow through the same portal and slope as the idle Tiller mine. Production\nis expected to resume once warranted by market conditions. We estimate that the Knox Complex contains reserves\ncapable of yielding approximately 8 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated\nmetallurgical coal resource tons of 275 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Knox Creek Complex is\napproximately 15 years.\nFrom time to time, we process coal purchased from other independent producers at the Knox Creek preparation\nplant and load-out facilities. We have also processed and loaded coal from our Berwind Complex at this facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired multiple permits from various affiliates of Omega Highwall Mining,\nLLC. These permits are in close proximity to our Knox Creek preparation plant and loadout infrastructure and provide\nimmediate access to two separate mining areas in Southwestern Virginia. One is a deep mine permit in the Jawbone\nSeam, a geologically advantaged metallurgical coal reserve and resource. The second is a metallurgical surface mine in\nthe Tiller seam that is mined via surface and highwall mining methods.\nIn August 2021, we began production at the Big Creek surface mine. We added a highwall miner in the fourth\nquarter of 2021. The mine reached full production during 2023.\nRAM Mine\nFollowing years of delays, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued a denial of the\nRAM Mine permit in southwest Pennsylvania. While the Company believes that the RAM permit was denied incorrectly\nand capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus on our other core properties and\nmonetize these assets at the appropriate time.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMaben Complex\nThe Maben property is located in southern West Virginia and consists of approximately 28,000 acres of\ncontrolled mineral rights acquired from the purchase of Maben Coal in the third quarter of 2022. As part of the\ntransaction, we assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection,\nwhich authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground methods. The\nproperty also has issued permits covering an existing haul road as well as an active refuse disposal area together with a\npreparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the closing date. In early 2024, the\nCompany completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be relocated to the Company’s Maben\nComplex.\nThe Maben property contains various areas of high-quality low-vol metallurgical coal in the Sewell, Beckley,\nPocahontas 3, Pocahontas 4, and Pocahontas 6 seams of coal. The Company expects that coal contained in the Sewell\nseam will be mined by surface and high-wall mining methods. Initial production began in 2023, reaching an annualized\nproduction rate of approximately 250,000 tons of low-volatile coal. The Company will consider deep mine development\nof coal contained in Beckley, Pocahontas 3, 4, and 6 seams at a future point. Although the Company currently utilizes\nthe Berwind preparation plant, such development would require the construction of a new preparation plant and loadout\nas mentioned above, which is under way.\nBrook Mine\nThe property is located in northeastern Wyoming, near Sheridan, and consists of approximately 16,000 acres of\ncontrolled mineral rights and a research and development facility that were acquired as part of the purchase of Ramaco\nCoal during 2022. The property includes a thermal coal deposit and permit as well as occurrences of rare earth elements.\nThe mine is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of\nrare earth elements. This property is being used to support the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and\ncommercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal.\nThree drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core drillholes specifically targeting rare earth elements\n(REEs) have been completed within the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results of these drilling programs\nindicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical elements such as Yttrium,\nGallium, and Germanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these minerals within the current\nBrook Mine permit area.\nCustomers and Contracts\nCoal prices differ substantially by region and are impacted by many factors including the overall economy,\ndemand for steel, demand for electricity, location, market, quality and type of coal, mine operation costs and the cost of\ncustomer alternatives. The major factors influencing our business are the global economy and demand for steel.\nWe market the bulk of our production to North American integrated steel mills and coke plants, as well as\ninternational customers in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Additionally, we market limited amounts of our\nproduction to various premium-priced specialty markets, such as foundry cokemakers, manufacturers of activated carbon\nproducts, and specialty metals producers.\nCoal quality and volumes are stipulated in coal sales agreements, and, in many cases, the annual pricing and\nvolumes are fixed. Our contracts with customers typically require us to deliver coal with minimum specifications or\nqualities. Variances from these specifications or qualities are settled by employing price adjustments.\nGenerally, the Company’s domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically\nfixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either fixed or derived against index-based pricing\nmechanisms.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe sold 3.5 million tons of coal during 2023. Of this, 33% was sold to North American markets and 67% was\nsold into export markets, excluding Canada. Principally, our export market sales were made to Europe. During 2023,\nsales to three customers accounted for approximately 41% of total revenue. No other customer accounted for 10% or\nmore of our total revenue during 2023. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing coal or significantly reduced its\npurchases from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTrade Names, Trademarks and Patents\nWe do not have any registered trademarks or trade names for our traditional products and services or\nsubsidiaries, nor do we believe that any trademark or trade name is material to our metallurgical coal business. The\nnames of the seams in which we have coal reserves, and attributes thereof, are widely recognized in the metallurgical\ncoal market. However, trademarks related to our advanced carbon products business could become material depending\non future developments.\nIn connection with our advanced carbon products business, the Company holds 61 intellectual property patents\nand pending patents related to the conversion of low-cost carbon ore into higher-value carbon products as well as\nexclusive licensing agreements, all of which have a remaining duration of 14-20 years.\nCompetition\nOur principal domestic competitors include Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Blackhawk Mining, LLC,\nCoronado Global Resources Inc., Arch Resources, Inc., Peabody Energy Corporation and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. We\nalso compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one\nor more foreign countries, such as Australia, Canada, and Colombia. Many of these coal producers are larger than we are\nand have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do.\nSuppliers\nSupplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation\nsupplies, lubricants and other raw materials as well as spare parts and other consumables used in the mining process. We\nuse third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and\nconstruction. We believe adequate substitute suppliers and contractors are available, and we are not dependent on any\none supplier or contractor. We continually seek to develop relationships with suppliers and contractors that focus on\nreducing our costs while improving quality and service.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety and Other Regulatory Matters\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations, such as those relating to permitting and licensing matters, employee health and safety, reclamation and\nrestoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and\ndisposal of certain materials (including solid and hazardous wastes), remediation of contaminated sites, surface\nsubsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming, delay the commencement,\ncontinuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities, and depress demand for our products by\nimposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly\nevolving, and the trend has been for increasingly complex and stringent regulation over time. New legislative or\nadministrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the\nenvironment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs.\nDue in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of\nthese requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations.\nExpenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and\n11\nTable of Contents\ncompliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term\nenvironmental liabilities.\nThe following is a summary of the various federal and state environmental and similar regulations that have a\nmaterial impact on our business:\nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the\n“SMCRA”) establishes comprehensive operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations and\nrequires that such standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. The SMCRA\nalso stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the\nClean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(the “RCRA”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the\n“CERCLA”). Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the United States Office of Surface Mining\nReclamation and Enforcement (the “OSMRE”) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state\nprograms under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. Our operations are located in West Virginia and\nVirginia, which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs.\nThe SMCRA imposes a complex set of requirements covering all facets of coal mining. SMCRA regulations\ngovern, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil or growth medium removal and\nreplacement, disposal of excess spoil and coal refuse, protection of the hydrologic balance, and suitable post mining land\nuses.\nFrom time to time, the OSMRE will also update its mining regulations under the SMCRA. For example, the\nOSMRE has previously sought to impose stricter stream protection requirements by requiring more extension pre-\nmining and baseline data for coal mining operations. The rule was disapproved by Congress pursuant to the\nCongressional Review Act. However, whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new stream protection\nrule remains uncertain. The existing rules, or other new SMCRA regulations, could result in additional material costs,\nobligations and restrictions upon our operations.\nAbandoned Mine Lands Fund. The SMCRA also imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations,\nthe proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (the “AML Fund”), which is used to\nrestore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The adjusted fees proposed in the Interim Final Rule\nper ton for October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2034 are (i) 22.4 cents per ton for surface-mined anthracite,\nbituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $2.24 per ton or more, (ii) 9.6 cents per ton for underground-\nmined anthracite, bituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $0.96 per ton, and (iii) 6.4 cents per ton for\nsurface- and underground-mined lignite coal if the value per ton is $3.20 per ton or more. The Interim Final Rule took\neffect in August 2022. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements\nand our experience related to similar activities. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is\ngreater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nMining Permits and Approvals. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining\noperations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state, and local authorities data detailing the effect or\nimpact that any proposed exploration project for production of coal may have upon the environment, the public and our\nemployees. The permitting rules are complex and continuously updated, and may be subject to discretionary\ninterpretations by regulators. Further, the laws, rules, and regulations that govern our mining operations authorize\nsubstantial fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits under some circumstances.\nMonetary sanctions and, in certain circumstances, even criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with\nthese laws. Compliance with required permits and associated regulations may have a material adverse impact on our\noperations, earnings, or financial condition.\nApplications for permits and permit renewals associated with our mining operations are also subject to public\ncomment and potential legal challenges from third parties seeking to prevent a permit from being issued, or to overturn\nthe applicable agency’s grant of the permit. Should our permitting efforts become subject to such challenges, the permits\nmay not be issued in a timely fashion, may impose requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our mining\n12\nTable of Contents\noperations or to do so profitably, or may not be issued at all. Any delays, denials, or revocation of these or other similar\npermits we need to operate could reduce our production and materially adversely impact our cash flow and results of our\noperations.\nIn order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities, mine operators must also\nsubmit a reclamation plan for restoring the mined property to its prior condition, productive use or other permitted\ncondition. The conditions of certain permits also require that we obtain surface-owner consent if the surface estate has\nbeen split from the mineral estate. This requires us to negotiate with third parties for surface access that overlies coal we\nacquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting years in some instances,\nwhich can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate for land access, we\ncould be denied a permit to mine coal we already own.\nFinally, we typically submit necessary mining permit applications several months, or even years, before we\nanticipate mining a new area. However, we cannot control the pace at which the government issues permits needed for\nnew or ongoing operations. For example, the process of obtaining CWA permits can be particularly time-consuming and\nsubject to delays and denials. The Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) also has the authority to veto permits\nissued by the U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers (the “Corps”) under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the\ndischarge of dredged or fill material into regulated waters without a permit. Even after we obtain the permits that we\nneed to operate, many of the permits must be periodically renewed, or may require modification. There is some risk that\nnot all existing permits will be approved for renewal, or that existing permits will be approved for renewal only upon\nterms that restrict or limit our operations in ways that may be material.\nFinancial Assurance. Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its\nreclamation and lease obligations under the SMCRA through the use of surety bonds or other approved forms of\nfinancial security for payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure or reclamation costs. The changes\nin the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies involving prominent coal\nproducers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their responsibilities under the SMCRA\npermits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE issued a policy advisory in\nAugust 2016 to state agencies that was intended to discourage authorized states from approving self-bonding\narrangements (the “Policy Advisory”). Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, certain states,\nincluding Virginia, had previously announced that they would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation\nobligations under the state mining laws. Additionally, in March 2018, the Government Accounting Office recommended\nthat Congress consider amending the SMCRA to eliminate the availability of self-bonding to guarantee responsibilities\nunder SMCRA permits. Individually and collectively, these and future revised various financial assurance requirements\nmay increase the amount of financial assurance needed and limit the types of acceptable instruments, straining the\ncapacity of the surety markets to meet demand. This may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining the\nrequired financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and\nbusiness activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term\nobligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. The bonds are renewable\non a yearly basis. Surety bond rates have increased in recent years and the market terms of such bonds have generally\nbecome less favorable. Sureties typically require coal producers to post collateral, often having a value equal to 40% or\nmore of the face amount of the bond. As a result, we may be required to provide collateral, letters of credit or other\nassurances of payment in order to obtain the necessary types and amounts of financial assurance. Under our surety\nbonding program, we are not currently required to post any letters of credit or other collateral to secure the surety bonds;\nobtaining letters of credit in lieu of surety bonds could result in a significant cost increase. Moreover, the need to obtain\nletters of credit may also reduce amounts that we can borrow under any senior secured credit facility for other purposes.\nIf, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure letters of credit\nindefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, our profitability may be negatively\naffected.\nWe intend to maintain a credit profile that precludes the need to post collateral for our surety bonds.\nNonetheless, our surety has the right to demand additional collateral at its discretion.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSome international customers require new suppliers to post performance guarantees during the initial stages of\nqualifying to become a long-term supplier. To date we have not had to provide a performance guarantee, but it is\npossible that such a guarantee could be required in the future.\nMine Safety and Health. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the “MINE Act”) and\nthe Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “MINER Act”), and regulations issued under\nthese federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been\nadopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations,\nincluding training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of\nmining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The\nMine Safety and Health Administration (the “MSHA”) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations\npromulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and\nenforcement. The various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations place restrictions\non our methods of operation and result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or criminal liability\nfor the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity.\nThe regulations enacted under the Mine Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely\nexpanded or made more stringent, raising compliance costs and increasing potential liability. Our compliance with\ncurrent or future mine health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs. At this time, it is not possible to\npredict the full effect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but any\nexpansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more stringent, may have a negative impact on the\nprofitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine safety and health regulations, we could face\npenalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely impact our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nIn addition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on\nsafety considerations under certain circumstances, such as imminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and\nunwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. If an incident were to occur at one of our operations,\nit could be shut down for an extended period of time, and our reputation with prospective customers could be materially\ndamaged. Moreover, if one of our operations is issued a notice of pattern of violations, then MSHA can issue an order\nwithdrawing the miners from the area affected by any enforcement action during each subsequent significant and\nsubstantial (“S&S”) citation until the S&S citation or order is abated.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease. We are insured for workers’ compensation benefits for\nwork related injuries that occur within our United States operations. We retain insurance coverage for all of our\nsubsidiaries and are insured for the statutory limits. Workers’ compensation liabilities, including those related to claims\nincurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected\npayments using historical data of the operating subsidiary or combined insurance industry data when historical data is\nlimited. State workers’ compensation acts typically provide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil\nlawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional torts. However, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act\nprovides a much broader exception to workers’ compensation immunity. The exception allows an injured employee to\nrecover against his or her employer where he or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which\nthe employer was aware that was a violation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of\nlawsuits are not uncommon and could have a significant impact on our operating costs.\nIn addition, we obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes\ncoverage for medical and disability benefits for occupational disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act\nof 1969 and the Mine Act. Under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform\nAct of 1977, as amended in 1981, each coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits to claimants who are\ncurrent and former employees and also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses\nto claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to January 1, 1970.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes significant changes to the federal black lung\nprogram including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and\nthe establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of\ncoal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact\non our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. In addition to possibly incurring liability under\nfederal statutes, we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims.\nClean Air Act. The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations\nboth directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include CAA permitting\nrequirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter such as fugitive\ndust. The CAA indirectly impacts coal mining operations by extensively regulating the emissions of particulate matter,\nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. In addition to the\ngreenhouse gas (“GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may materially and adversely affect\nour operations, financial results, liquidity, and demand for our coal, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n• Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. In July 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the\n“CSAPR”), a cap-and-trade program that requires 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard of the U.S.\nto reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution\nin other states. In September 2016, the EPA finalized a rule that further limited summertime (May-\nSeptember) nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States beginning\nin May 2017 (the “CSAPR Update Rule”). For states to meet these requirements, a number of coal-fired\nelectric generating units will likely need to be retired, rather than retrofitted with the necessary emission\ncontrol technologies, reducing demand for thermal coal. Moreover, in September 2019, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) remanded the CSAPR Update Rule\nto the EPA on the grounds that it failed to timely require upwind states to control or eliminate their\ncontribution to ozone and/or fine particulate matter in downwind states, as required under the CAA. In\nOctober 2020, the EPA proposed a Revised CSAPR Update Rule in response to the D.C. Circuit’s ruling,\nwhich was finalized in April 2021. The final rule resolves 21 states’ outstanding interstate pollution\ntransport obligations and would require additional emissions reductions of nitrogen oxides from power\nplants in 12 states. Imposition of stricter deadlines for controlling downwind contribution could accelerate\nunit retirements or the need to implement emission control strategies. Any reduction in the amount of coal\nconsumed by electric power generators as a result of these limitations could decrease demand for thermal\ncoal.\n• Acid Rain. Title IV of the CAA requires reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities and\napplies to all coal-fired power plants generating greater than 25 megawatts of power. Affected power plants\nhave sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution\ncontrol devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading sulfur dioxide emission\nallowances. These reductions could impact our customers in the electric generation industry. These\nrequirements are not supplanted by the CSAPR.\n• NAAQS for Criterion Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as National\nAmbient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”), for six common air pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen\ndioxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter (“PM”) and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance\n(referred to as “non-attainment areas”) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. The\nEPA has adopted NAAQS for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, PM and ground-\nlevel ozone. The CAA further requires the EPA to periodically review and revise the NAAQS, resulting in\nthe trend of more stringent standards over time. In February 2024, for example, the EPA published a final\nrule that revised the primary annual PM standard by lowering the level from 12.0 µg/m3 to 9.0 µg/m3.\n2.5\nStates with non-attainment areas must adopt a state implementation plan that demonstrates compliance with\nthe existing or new air quality standards. These plans could require significant additional emissions control\nexpenditures at coal-fired power plants. New rules and standards may also impose additional emissions\ncontrol requirements on our customers in the electric generation, steelmaking, and coke industries. Because\n15\nTable of Contents\ncoal mining operations emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations could be affected\nwhen the new standards are implemented by the states.\n• Mercury and Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA has established emission standards for mercury and other\nmetals, fine particulates, and acid gases from coal- and oil-fired power plants through the Mercury and Air\nToxics Standards (“MATS”) rule. Like CSAPR, MATS and other similar future regulations could\naccelerate the retirement of a significant number of coal-fired power plants. Such retirements would likely\nadversely impact our business.\nGlobal Climate Change. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There\nis widespread concern about the contributions of human activity to such changes, especially through the emission of\nGHGs. Numerous reports from scientific and governmental bodies such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change have expressed heightened concerns about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel\ncombustion, on the global climate. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry. First, the\nend use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is a source of GHGs.\nSecond, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our customers is a source\nof GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent GHG than carbon\ndioxide, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and production are subject\nto pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international,\nnational, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. Collectively, these\ninitiatives could result in higher electric costs to our customers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel\ngeneration, which could in turn adversely impact our business.\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with\nthe production of power generation. However, we may seek to sell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation\nmarket in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their\noperations.\nAt the international level, in April 2016, the United States joined the international community at the 21st\nConference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which\nresulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set GHG emission reduction goals\nevery five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, plans were formally announced for the U.S. to withdraw from\nthe Paris Agreement with an effective exit date in November 2020. In February 2021, the current administration\nannounced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new “nationally determined contribution” for U.S.\nGHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. In addition,\nshortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address\nclimate change. In November 2021, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate\nChange concluded with the finalization of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least\n30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Forty-six countries signed\nonto a Global Coal to Clean Energy Transition Statement, committing to transition away from unabated coal power\ngeneration by about 2030 for “major economies” and a global transition by roughly 2040. Most recently, at the 27th\nconference of parties (“COP27”), President Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane\nemissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other\npartner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low\nmethane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals\nof the Paris Agreement. International commitments, reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden’s executive\norders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations that may impact our\nbusiness.\nThe $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of\nclimate-focused spending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme\n16\nTable of Contents\nweather events, and clean energy and transportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 into law. The law provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of\nlow-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. The\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 also provides significant funding for research and development of low-carbon energy\nproduction methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change.\nFurthermore, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the\nenvironment, because emissions of GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s\natmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA, over time, has attempted to restrict emissions\nof GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in August 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan\n(the “CPP”) to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, which did not formally go into effect because the U.S.\nSupreme Court stayed its implementation in February 2016. In July 2019, the EPA adopted the Affordable Clean Energy\nRule (the “ACE Rule”) that repealed and replaced the CPP. The ACE Rule required states to set appropriate GHG\nemission standards for power plants within their jurisdiction based upon the application of “candidate” heat rate\nimprovement measures. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the agency for\nfurther proceedings. In February 2021, the EPA issued a memorandum stating the agency’s position that neither the\nClean Power Plan nor the ACE Rule are in effect, and future regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing power\ngeneration facilities remains uncertain. In May 2023, the EPA proposed revised new source performance standards for\nGHG emissions from new and reconstructed power plants that undertake a large modification. The finalization of this\nrule and any future rules or future GHG emission standards may encourage a shift away from coal-fired power\ngeneration, adversely impacting the market for our product.\nAdditionally, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to require registrants to disclose certain climate-\nrelated information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules will require the Company to disclose,\namong other things, material climate-related risks, information about our board of directors’ (“Board”) oversight of\nclimate-related risks, management’s role in managing material climate-related risks, and Scope 1 and Scope 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with these rules will be phased in over time based on our filing status as well as\nthe content of the disclosure and assurance requirements. Although the Company is in the process of evaluating the new\nrules, compliance may result in increased legal, accounting, and other compliance-related costs, as well as place strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nAt the state level, several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have already adopted measures requiring\nGHG emissions to be reduced within state or regional boundaries, including cap-and-trade programs and the imposition\nof renewable energy portfolio standards. Various states and regions have also adopted GHG initiatives, and certain\ngovernmental bodies have imposed, or are considering the imposition of, fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs\nby certain facilities. A number of states have also enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use\nrenewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have\nintensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support international climate commitments and treaties.\nThe extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new\ncoal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the\namount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions\ncould decrease demand for thermal coal, thereby reducing our revenue and adversely affecting our business and results\nof operations. We or our prospective customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage\ntechnologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards.\nFinally, there have been attempts to encourage the reduction of coalbed methane emissions because methane\nhas a greater GHG effect than carbon dioxide and can give rise to safety concerns. For example, the EPA has established\nthe Coalbed Methane Outreach Program in an effort to mitigate methane emissions from underground coal mines\nthrough voluntary initiatives and outreach in partnership with the coal industry. If new laws or regulations were\nintroduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely affect our costs of operations by requiring\ninstallation of air pollution controls, higher taxes, or costs incurred to purchase credits that permit us to continue\noperations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nClean Water Act. The CWA and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by\nrestricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the United States. Likewise,\npermits are required under the CWA to construct impoundments, fills or other structure in areas that are designated as\nwaters of the United States. For example, prior to placing fill material in waters of the United States, such as with the\nconstruction of a valley fill, coal mining companies are required to obtain a permit from the Corps under Section 404 of\nthe CWA. The permit can be either a Nationwide Permit (“NWP”), normally NWP 21, 49 or 50 for coal mining\nactivities, or a more complicated individual permit. NWPs are designed to allow for an expedited permitting process,\nwhile individual permits involve a longer and more detailed review process. The EPA has the authority to veto permits\nissued by the Corps under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into\nregulated waters without a permit. Additionally, recent court decisions, regulatory actions and proposed legislation have\ncreated uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements, such as (1) an April 2020 decision further\ndefining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point\nsource to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit and (2) a May 2023 decision further\ndefining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that discharges from a point source to a wetland\ncould fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit if the adjacent body of water is a relatively permanent body\nof water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and the wetland has a continuous surface connection with\nthat water.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants into waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a\nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit from the appropriate state or federal permitting\nauthority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for discharged pollutants and other terms and conditions,\nincluding required monitoring of discharges. Failure to comply with the CWA or NPDES permits can lead to the\nimposition of significant penalties, litigation, compliance costs and delays in coal production. Potential changes in state\nand federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification of permits with new or\nmore stringent effluent limits or terms and conditions. For instance, waters designated by states as impaired (i.e., as not\nmeeting current water quality standards) are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations, which may\nlead to the adoption of more stringent discharge standards for our coal mines and could require more costly treatment.\nLikewise, the water quality of certain receiving streams requires an anti-degradation review before approving any\ndischarge permits. TMDL regulations and anti-degradation policies may increase the cost, time and difficulty associated\nwith obtaining and complying with NPDES permits. In addition, in certain circumstances private citizens may challenge\nalleged violations of NPDES permit limits in court. Recently, certain citizen groups have filed lawsuits alleging ongoing\ndischarges of pollutants, including selenium and conductance, from valley fills located at certain mining sites in some of\nthe regions where we operate. In West Virginia, several of these cases have been successful for the challengers. While it\nis difficult to predict the outcome of any potential or future suits, such litigation could result in increased compliance\ncosts following the completion of mining at our operations.\nFinally, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a new definition of “waters of the United States”\n(“WOTUS”) that would have expanded areas requiring NPDES or Corps Section 404 permits. This definition never took\neffect as it was replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”) in December 2019. A coalition of\nstates and cities, environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona in August 2021. In December 2022, the EPA and Corps announced the final\n“Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule. This rule is not currently operative in certain states and for\ncertain parties due to ongoing litigation. In August 2023, the EPA and Corps issued a final rule to amend the “Revised\nDefinition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 2023 decision in the case\nof Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. In the jurisdictions and for the parties where the January 2023 rule is\nenjoined, the EPA and Corps are interpreting “waters of the United States” consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Sackett and the pre-2015 regulatory regime. To the extent a new rule or further litigation expands the scope\nof the CWA’s jurisdiction, the CWA permits we need may not be issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may\nbe issued with new requirements which restrict our ability to conduct mining operations or to do so profitably.\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. The RCRA and corresponding state laws establish standards for the\nmanagement of solid and hazardous wastes generated at our various facilities. Besides affecting current waste disposal\npractices, the RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and\n18\nTable of Contents\ndisposal practices. In addition, the RCRA requires certain of our facilities to evaluate and respond to any past release, or\nthreatened release, of a hazardous substance that may pose a risk to human health or the environment.\nThe RCRA may affect coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the proper management,\nhandling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. For example, the EPA regulates coal ash as a solid\nwaste under Subtitle D of the RCRA through its coal combustion residuals (“CCR”) rule. This rule establishes limits for\nthe location of new sites and requires closure of sites that fail to meet prescribed engineering standards, regular\ninspections of impoundments, and immediate remediation and closure of unlined ponds that are polluting ground water.\nAs initially promulgated, the rule exempted closed coal ash impoundments located at inactive facilities and allowed for\nthe continued operation of unlined or clay-lined ponds that were not polluting groundwater. Additionally, in\nDecember 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provided for the\nestablishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of CCR and authorizes states to incorporate the EPA’s\nfinal rule for CCR or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. In May 2023, the EPA\npublished proposed changes to the CCR rule for legacy CCR surface impoundments and a notice of data availability\nrelated to the proposed rule in November 2023. The finalization of this proposal, the current requirements of the CCR\nrules, as well as any future changes in the management of CCR, could increase our customers’ operating costs and\npotentially reduce their ability or need to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCR,\nincluding coal ash, could lead to material liability for our customers under the RCRA or other federal or state laws and\npotentially further reduce the demand for coal.\nCurrently, certain coal mine wastes, such as earth and rock covering a mineral deposit (commonly referred to as\noverburden) and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management under the RCRA. Any change\nor reclassification of this exemption could significantly increase our coal mining costs.\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. CERCLA and similar state laws\naffect coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of\nhazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, joint and several liability may be\nimposed on hazardous substance generators, site owners, transporters, lessees and others regardless of fault or the\nlegality of the original disposal activity. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and\nprocessing operations from the primary hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute\nhazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used\nby coal companies in operations, such as chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA, could trigger the\nliability provisions of CERCLA or similar state laws. The EPA periodically evaluates the CERCLA list of hazardous\nsubstances. In September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”),\nincluding their salts and structural isomers, as hazardous substances under CERCLA. This proposed rule, if finalized,\nmay result in increased costs to cleanup properties at which the listed PFAS were released.\nWe may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for coal mines that we currently own,\nlease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our\npredecessors sent hazardous substances. These liabilities could be significant and materially and adversely impact our\nfinancial results and liquidity.\nEndangered Species and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Acts. The ESA and similar state legislation protect\nspecies designated as threatened, endangered or other special status. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”)\nworks closely with the OSMRE and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected\nfrom mining-related impacts. Several species indigenous to the areas in which we operate are protected under the ESA.\nOther species in the vicinity of our operations may have their listing status reviewed in the future and could also become\nprotected under the ESA. In addition, the USFWS has identified bald eagle habitats in some of the counties where we\noperate. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits taking certain actions that would harm bald or golden\neagles without obtaining a permit from the USFWS. Compliance with the requirements of the ESA and the Bald and\nGolden Eagle Protection Act could have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits. These\nrequirements may also include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities\nin areas containing the affected species or their habitats. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters\n19\nTable of Contents\nbeyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or\ntake measures which may adversely impact our business or operations.\nUse of Explosives. Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting\nactivities. Due to these regulations, we will incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast\nsurveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to various regulatory requirements. For\nexample, the Department of Homeland Security requires facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including\nammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) to complete a screening review. Our mines are low risk, Tier 4 facilities\nwhich are not subject to additional security plans. The adoption of future, more stringent standards related to the use of\nexplosives could materially adversely impact our cost or ability to conduct our mining operations.\nNational Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (the “NEPA”) requires federal\nagencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly\nimpact the environment, such as issuing a permit or other approval. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will\ntypically prepare an environmental assessment to determine the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a\nproposed project. Where the activities in question have significant impacts to the environment, the agency must prepare\nan environmental impact statement. Compliance with the NEPA can be time-consuming and may result in the imposition\nof mitigation measures that could affect the amount of coal that we are able to produce from mines on federal lands, and\nmay require public comment. Furthermore, whether agencies have complied with the NEPA is subject to protest, appeal\nor litigation, which can delay or halt projects. The NEPA review process, including potential disputes regarding the level\nof evaluation required for climate change impacts, may extend the time and/or increase the costs and difficulty of\nobtaining necessary governmental approvals, and may lead to litigation regarding the adequacy of the NEPA analysis,\nwhich could delay or potentially preclude the issuance of approvals or grant of leases.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) revised NEPA’s implementing regulations to\nmake the NEPA process more efficient, effective, and timely. The rule required federal agencies to develop procedures\nconsistent with the new rule within one year of the rule’s effective date (which was extended to two years in June 2021).\nThese regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in several federal district courts, and in October 2021, CEQ issued a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking to amend the NEPA regulatory changes adopted in 2020 in two phases. Phase I of CEQ’s\nproposed rulemaking process was finalized on April 20, 2022 and generally restored provisions that were in effect prior\nto 2020. Phase II of the proposed rulemaking was published by CEQ in July 2023. Phase II proposes further revisions in\nan attempt to ensure the NEPA process “provides for efficient and effective environmental reviews,” and meets\nenvironmental, environmental justice, and climate change objectives. These rules could create additional delays and\ncosts in the NEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our\noperations due to the increased risk of legal challenges from environmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate\nimpacts.\nOther Environmental Laws. We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local\nenvironmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include but are not\nlimited to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning and Community\nRight-to-Know Act and similar state laws. Each of these laws can impact permitting or planned operations and can result\nin additional costs or operational delays.\nSeasonality\nOur primary business is not materially impacted by seasonal fluctuations. Demand for metallurgical coal is\ngenerally more heavily influenced by other factors such as the general economy, interest rates and commodity prices.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe our employees are a competitive advantage. We seek to foster a culture that supports diversity,\nequity and inclusion, and strive to provide a safe, healthy and rewarding work environment with opportunities for\ngrowth. We had 811 employees as of December 31, 2023, including our named executive officers, and nearly all of our\nemployees are full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we\n20\nTable of Contents\nhave not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relation issues. We believe we have good relations\nwith our employees. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, training,\nretaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We also depend on experienced\ncontractors and third-party consultants to conduct some of our day-to-day activities. We plan to continue to use the\nservices of many of these contractors and consultants.\nSafety Philosophy. We have a comprehensive health and safety program based on the core belief that all\naccidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. We believe that:\n• Business excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\n• Any task that cannot be performed safely should not be performed.\n• Working safely is a requirement of our employees.\n• Controlling the work environment is important, but human behavior within the work environment is\nparamount.\n• Safety starts with individual decision-making—all employees must assume a share of responsibility for acts\nwithin their control that pose a risk of injury to themselves or fellow workers.\n• All levels of the organization must be proactive in implementing safety processes that promote a safe and\nhealthy work environment.\n• Consequently, we are committed to providing a safe work environment; providing our employees with\nproper training and equipment; and implementing safety and health rules, policies and programs that foster\nsafety excellence.\nOur safety program includes a focus on the following:\n• Hiring the Right Workers. Our hiring program includes significant pre-employment screening and\nreference checks.\n• Safety Incentives. We have a compensation system that encourages and rewards excellent safety\nperformance.\n• Communication. We conduct regular safety meetings with the frequent involvement of senior management\nto reinforce the “tone at the top.”\n• Drug and Alcohol Testing. We require pre-employment drug screening as well as regular random drug\ntesting that exceeds regulatory requirements.\n• Continuous Improvement Programs. We track key safety performance metrics, including accident rates,\nviolation types and frequencies. We have specific targets in these areas, and we measure performance\nagainst these targets. Specific action plans are implemented for targeted improvement in areas where\nperformance falls below our expectations.\n• Training. Our training program includes comprehensive new employee orientation and training, annual\nrefresher training and task training components. These training modules are designed to reinforce our high\nsafety expectations. Work rules and procedures are a key element of this training.\n• Accident Investigation. We have a structured accident investigation procedure that identifies root causes of\naccidents as well as actions necessary to prevent reoccurrence. We focus on near misses and close calls as a\nmeans of attempting to prevent more serious accidents from occurring.\n• Safety Audits. We conduct periodic safety audits that include workplace examinations, including\nobservation of workers at work, as well as safety program reviews. Both internal and external resources are\nutilized to conduct these audits.\n• Employee Performance Improvement. A key element of our safety program is the recognition that safe\nwork practices are a requirement of employment. We identify employee performance which is below\nexpectations and develop specific action plans for improvement.\n• Employee Involvement. The key to excellent safety is employee involvement and engagement. We foster\ndirect employee involvement in a number of ways including audit participation, accident investigations, as\ntraining resources and through solicitation of ideas in small group meetings and through anonymous\nworkplace observation suggestion boxes.\n21\nTable of Contents\n• Positive Reinforcement. Establishing safety as a core belief is paramount to our safety performance. As a\nresult, we look for opportunities to celebrate accomplishments and to build pride in our operational safety\nand performance.\nAvailable Information\nOur investor relations website is ir.ramacoresources.com and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily\nfinding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or\nfurnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code\nof Conduct and Ethics) and press releases. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public from commercial\ndocument retrieval services and at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves certain risks and uncertainties. The following is a description of significant risks that\nmight cause our future financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from those expected. In addition to\nthe risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be unknown\nto us and some of which we may deem immaterial. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. A summary of our risk factors is as\nfollows:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• Our properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any\ndevelopment delays or cost increases or are unable to complete the construction of our facilities, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n• We have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest\ncoal customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\n• Our customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\n• Deterioration in the global economic conditions, a worldwide financial downturn or negative credit\nmarket conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends.\n• Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global\noutbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19.\n• We do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to\nfluctuations in market pricing.\n• We face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in\nour estimates could result in lower-than-expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased\nprofitability.\n• A substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\n• Changes in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged\nperiods of slow economic growth, and global instability and actual and threatened geopolitical conflict,\ncould have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and\nsuppliers.\n• Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices\nfor, our coal, which could impair our profitability.\n• The availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could\naffect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers.\n22\nTable of Contents\n• Any significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants,\ncould impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers and materially and adversely affect\nour results of operations.\n• Our ability to collect payments from customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or\nif they fail to honor their contracts with us.\n• If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, we may have to curtail our\noperations and delay our construction and growth plans, which may materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\n• Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if\nthe costs of financial assurance increase materially.\n• Defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct\nmining operations on these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\n• Substantially all of our mining properties are leased from our affiliates and conflicts of interest may\narise in the future as a result.\n• We may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\n• Our lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours,\ndepriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments.\n• Technology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\n• The current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that\ncould adversely affect our mining operations or cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n• Current and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of\nthe environment and natural resources may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our\ncoal operations.\n• Our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our\nproperties may have environmental contamination, which could expose us to significant costs and\nliabilities.\n• We must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations,\nwhich can be a costly and time-consuming process and result in restrictions on our operations.\n• We and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\n• Our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing\nbusiness at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation. In addition,\ngovernment inspectors in certain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut\ndown based on safety considerations.\n• We have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the\nassumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts\nthan anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Company\n• Our ability to pay dividends may be limited by the amount of cash we generate from operations\nfollowing the payment of fees and expenses, by restrictions of any future debt instruments and by\nadditional factors unrelated to our profitability.\n• Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\n• Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that\nmay compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have\nconflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\n23\nTable of Contents\n• Holders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are\nsubject to risks associated with an investment in the Company as a whole, even if the holder does not\nown shares of Class A common stock.\n• Our Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets, and expenses between the Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of a class of common\nstock based on past performance.\n• Dividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to\nquarter. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends in the future or what the actual\ndividends will be for any future periods.\n• The market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the\nother assets and businesses of the Company.\n• Our new tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make\ndecisions that could adversely affect only the holders of one class of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any development\ndelays or cost increases or are unable to complete the construction of our facilities, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have not completed development plans for all of our coal properties, and do not expect to have full annual\nproduction from all of our properties until market conditions permit us to resume and complete these development plans.\nWe expect to incur significant capital expenditures until we have completed the development of our properties. In\naddition, the development of our properties involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal\nuncertainties that are beyond our control and that may cause delays in, or increase the costs associated with, their\ncompletion. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the development of the properties on schedule, at the budgeted\ncost or at all, and any delays beyond the expected development periods or increased costs above those expected to be\nincurred could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to complete or are substantially delayed in completing the development of any of our\nproperties, our business, financial condition, results of operations cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an increasingly concentrated customer base both domestically and\nglobally.\nThere are inherent risks whenever a significant percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited\nnumber of customers. Revenues from our largest customers may fluctuate from time to time based on numerous factors,\nincluding market conditions, which may be outside of our control. If any of our largest customers experience declining\nrevenues due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices that we charge\nfor our coal, which could have an adverse effect on our margins, profitability, cash flows and financial position. If any\ncustomers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, including by failing to buy and pay for coal they\ncommitted to purchase in sales contracts, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability\nto pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies—Concentrations” for additional information.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\nSubstantially all of the metallurgical coal that we produce is sold to steel producers. Therefore, demand for our\nmetallurgical coal is highly correlated to the steel industry. The steel industry’s demand for metallurgical coal is affected\nby a number of factors including the cyclical nature of that industry’s business, technological developments in the steel-\nmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant\nreduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for metallurgical coal, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, if less expensive\ningredients could be used in substitution for metallurgical coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for\nmetallurgical coal would materially decrease, which would also materially adversely affect demand for our metallurgical\ncoal. Our export customers, excluding Canada, include foreign steel producers who may be affected by the tariffs to the\nextent their production is imported into the U.S. Retaliatory threats by foreign nations to these tariffs may limit\ninternational trade and adversely impact global economic conditions.\nDeterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which prospective customers operate, a\nworldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nEconomic conditions in the industries in which most of our prospective customers operate, such as steelmaking\nand electric power generation, substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for coal. A deterioration\nof economic conditions in our prospective customers’ industries could cause a decline in demand for and production of\nmetallurgical coal. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries served by\nprospective customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global outbreaks of\ncontagious diseases, including COVID-19.\nGlobal outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the December 2019 outbreak of a strain of coronavirus\n(“COVID-19”), have the potential to significantly and adversely impact our operations and business. On March 11,\n2020, the World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Pandemics or disease outbreaks such\nas the COVID-19 outbreak may have a variety of adverse effects on our business, including by depressing commodity\nprices and the market value of our securities and limiting the ability of our management to meet with potential financing\nsources. Like other coal companies, our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures that\nwere taken to mitigate its impact. The pandemic resulted in widespread adverse impacts on our employees, customers,\nsuppliers and other parties with whom we have business relations. The spread of COVID-19 had a negative impact on\nthe financial markets, which may impact our ability to obtain additional financing. A prolonged downturn in the\nfinancial markets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to raise capital.\nWe cannot predict the full impact that future global outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19,\nwill have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time, due to\nnumerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments, including, among others, the\nconsequences of governmental and other measures designed to slow the spread of such diseases, the development of\neffective treatments, the duration of the outbreaks, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and\nother third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions\nresume.\nWe do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in market\npricing.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and are generally no\nlonger than one year in duration. Most metallurgical coal transactions in the U.S. are done on a calendar year basis,\nwhere both prices and volumes are fixed in the third and fourth quarter for the following calendar year. Globally the\nmarket is evolving to shorter term pricing. Some annual contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and most volumes\n25\nTable of Contents\nare being sold on an indexed basis, where prices are determined by averaging the leading spot indexes reported in the\nmarket and adjusting for quality. As a result, we are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. We are not protected from\noversupply or market conditions where we cannot sell our coal at economic prices. Metallurgical coal has been an\nextremely volatile commodity over the past ten years and prices are likely to be volatile in the future. There can be no\nassurances we will be able to mitigate such conditions as they arise. Any sustained failure to be able to market our coal\nduring such periods would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThe failure to access coal preparation facilities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal for\nour prospective customers and to meet quality specifications.\nThe costs of establishing the infrastructure necessary to enable us to continue to ramp up our mining operations\nwill be significant. We have constructed preparation and loading facilities at our Elk Creek Complex and have recently\nundertaken expansion projects to increase the rates of processing and preparation. Our Berwind Complex will remain\nunder development until we reach our full targeted annual coal production. Some of the Berwind coal will continue to be\nwashed at our active Knox Creek plant until our Berwind plant is fully up and running. We also endeavor to purchase,\nrelocate, and reassemble preparation plant assets at our Maben complex for future use. Our failure to provide the\nnecessary preparation, processing and loading facilities for our projects would have a material adverse effect on our\noperations.\nThe risks associated with the construction and operation of mines, processing plants and related infrastructure\ninclude:\n• the potential lack of availability or cost of skilled and unskilled labor, equipment and principal supplies\nneeded for construction of facilities;\n• the need to obtain necessary environmental and other governmental approvals and permits and the\ntiming of the receipt of those approvals and permits;\n• industrial accidents;\n• geologic mine failures, surface facility construction failures or mining, coal processing or transport\nequipment failures;\n• structural failure of an impoundment or refuse area;\n• natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods, droughts, rockslides and seismic\nactivity;\n• unusual or unexpected geological and coal quality conditions;\n• potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups or other activists,\nwhich may delay or prevent development activities; and\n• restrictions or regulations imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities.\nThe costs, timing and complexities of developing our projects may be greater than anticipated. Cost estimates\nmay increase significantly as more detailed engineering work is completed on a project. It is common in mining\noperations to experience unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, development and mine start-up.\nProduct alternatives or other technologies may reduce demand for our products.\nSubstantially all of our coal production is comprised of metallurgical coal, which commands a significant price\npremium over the majority of other forms of coal because of its use in blast furnaces for steel production. Metallurgical\ncoal has specific physical and chemical properties, which are necessary for efficient blast furnace operation. Steel\nproducers are continually investigating alternative steel production technologies with a view to reducing production\ncosts. The steel industry has increased utilization of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection processes, which\nreduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal and, in turn,\ngenerally decreases the demand for metallurgical coal. Many alternative technologies are designed to use lower quality\ncoals or other sources of carbon instead of higher cost high-quality metallurgical coal. While conventional blast furnace\ntechnology has been the most economic large-scale steel production technology for a number of years, and emergent\ntechnologies typically take many years to commercialize, there can be no assurance that over the longer term\n26\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive technologies not reliant on metallurgical coal would not emerge, which could reduce the demand and price\npremiums for metallurgical coal.\nMoreover, we may produce and market other coal products, such as thermal coal, which are also subject to\nalternative competition. Alternative technologies are continually being investigated and developed in order to reduce\nproduction costs or minimize environmental or social impact. In particular, alternatives with lower carbon footprints than\nour products are currently being researched and developed, as our customers are subject to increasing market and/or\nregulatory pressure to reduce their impacts on climate change. Further, the development and use of emerging\ntechnologies in the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy, including renewable energy, battery\nstorage, and energy efficiency technologies, may increase the availability of alternative energy sources or lower demand\nfor coal, resulting in lower prices and revenues. If competitive technologies emerge that use other materials in place of or\notherwise eliminate the need for our products, demand and price for our products might fall.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates\ncould result in lower-than-expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nCoal is economically recoverable when the price at which coal can be sold exceeds the costs and expenses of\nmining and selling the coal. Any forecasts of our future performance are based on, among other things, estimates of our\nrecoverable coal reserves. We base our reserve information on geologic data, coal ownership information and current\nand proposed mine plans. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of coal and\ncosts to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically\nrecoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Some of the factors and assumptions that can impact\neconomically recoverable coal reserve estimates include:\n• geologic and mining conditions;\n• historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n• the assumed effects of environmental and other regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;\n• our ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits;\n• future improvements in mining technology;\n• assumptions related to future prices; and\n• future operating costs, including the cost of materials, and capital expenditures.\nEach of the factors that impacts reserve estimation may vary considerably from the assumptions used in\nestimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of coal reserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues\nand expenditures with respect to our future coal reserves may vary from estimates, and these variances may be material.\nAs a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual future coal reserves.\nOur inability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable may have a material adverse effect\non our future profitability.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that\npossess the quality characteristics that prospective customers desire. Because our reserves will decline as we mine our\ncoal, our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically\nrecoverable to replace the reserves we will produce. If we fail to acquire or develop sufficient additional reserves over\nthe long term to replace the reserves depleted by our production, our existing reserves could eventually be exhausted.\nWe are dependent on contractors for the successful completion of the development of our properties.\nWe regularly use contractors in the development of our mines. Timely and cost-effective completion of the\ndevelopment of our properties, including necessary facilities and infrastructure, in compliance with agreed specifications\nis central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of our contractors under the agreements\nwith them.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages, if the contractor fails to perform in the manner\nrequired with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may\ndelay or impair the operation of our properties, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to\ncover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. Further, we may have disagreements with\nour contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and\nremedies under their contracts and increase the costs associated with development of the properties or result in a\ncontractor’s unwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the\nnegotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be\nrequired to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nPrices for coal are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including\noversupply relative to the demand available for our coal and weather. A substantial or extended decline in the prices\nwe receive for our coal could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our coal and depend, in part, on the\nmargins that we earn on sales of our coal. Our margins will reflect the price we receive for our coal over our cost of\nproducing and transporting our coal. Prices and quantities under U.S. domestic metallurgical coal sales contracts are\ngenerally based on expectations of the next year’s coal prices at the time the contract is entered into, renewed, extended\nor re-opened. Pricing in the global seaborne market is moving towards shorter term pricing models, typically using\nindexes. The expectation of future prices for coal depends upon many factors beyond our control, including the\nfollowing:\n• the market price for coal;\n• overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic\nand foreign coal, coke and steel;\n• the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users;\n• weather conditions in our markets that affect the demand for thermal coal or that affect the ability to\nproduce metallurgical coal;\n• competition from other coal suppliers;\n• technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n• the costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure;\n• the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and\nclimate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal mining industry, and delays in the receipt\nof, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental permits; and\n• increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection\nprocesses, which reduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from\nmetallurgical coal, and generally decrease the demand for metallurgical coal.\nMetallurgical coal is an extremely volatile commodity. There are no assurances that supplies will remain low,\nthat demand will not decrease or that overcapacity may resume, which could cause declines in the prices of and demand\nfor coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nChanges in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged periods of slow\neconomic growth, and global instability and actual and threatened geopolitical conflict, could have an adverse effect\non our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nOverall economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including adverse factors such as inflation, rising interest\nrates, supply chain disruptions and the impacts of the war in Ukraine, significantly impact our business. Periods of\neconomic downturn or continued uncertainty could result in difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or\n28\nTable of Contents\nprofitability and we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nOur operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, inflation,\nprevailing interest rates, and political factors, which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations, cash\nflows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, changes to tax laws and regulations resulting in\nincreased income tax liability, increased regulation, such as carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms,\nlimitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions taken by the U.S. government could\naffect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine has had a broad range of adverse impacts on global economic conditions, some of\nwhich have had and are likely to continue to have adverse impacts on our business, including increased raw material and\nenergy costs, softer customer demand and lower steel prices.\nAdditionally, we are also exposed to risks associated with the business success and creditworthiness of our\nsuppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic markets, we\nmay face the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials,\nand increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of customers or suppliers, which could delay payments\nfrom customers, result in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling, or to be unable to fill, our\nneeds at all or on a timely or cost-effective basis. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices for, our coal,\nwhich could impair our profitability. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the\ncompetitiveness of our coal abroad.\nWe compete with other producers primarily on the basis of coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and\nreliability of supply. We compete primarily with U.S. coal producers and with some Canadian coal producers for sales of\nmetallurgical coal to domestic steel producers and, to a lesser extent, thermal coal to electric power generators. We also\ncompete with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales of metallurgical coal in international markets. Certain\nof these coal producers may have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do. We sell coal to the\nseaborne metallurgical coal market, which is significantly affected by international demand and competition.\nWe cannot assure you that competition from other producers will not adversely affect us in the future. The coal\nindustry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years, including consolidation among some of our major\ncompetitors. We cannot assure you that the result of current or further consolidation in the coal industry, or the\nreorganization through bankruptcy of competitors with large legacy liabilities, will not adversely affect us. A number of\nour competitors have idled production over the last several years in light of lower metallurgical coal prices. A\nstabilization or increase in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new\nproducers to enter the market.\nIn addition, we face competition from foreign producers that sell their coal in the export market. Potential\nchanges to international trade agreements, trade concessions, foreign currency fluctuations or other political and\neconomic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. Additionally,\nNorth American steel producers face competition from foreign steel producers, which could adversely impact the\nfinancial condition and business of our prospective customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete on\nthe basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or\nother arrangements. Coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign\nmarkets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive\nadvantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our prospective foreign customers’\nlocal currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to prospective customers. Furthermore, if\nthe currencies of our prospective overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S.\ndollar, those prospective customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency\n29\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves many hazards and operating risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The\noccurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur mining operations, including our preparation and transportation infrastructure, are subject to many hazards\nand operating risks. Underground mining and related processing activities present inherent risks of injury to persons and\ndamage to property and equipment. Our mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations,\ndecrease production and increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time, thereby adversely affecting our\noperating results. In addition, if coal production declines, we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to\ndeliver under future sales contracts. Our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in prospective customers\ninitiating claims against us. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our future coal operations include:\n• variations in thickness of seams of coal;\n• adverse geologic conditions, including amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the\ncoal seam, that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine;\n• environmental hazards;\n• mining and processing equipment failures, structural failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n• fires or explosions, including as a result of methane, coal, coal dust or other explosive materials, or\nother accidents;\n• unexpected mine accidents, including rock-falls and explosions caused by the ignition of metallurgical\ncoal dust, natural gas or other explosive sources at our mine sites or fires caused by the spontaneous\ncombustion of metallurgical coal or similar mining accidents;\n• inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters or other force majeure events;\n• seismic activities, ground failures, rock bursts or structural cave-ins or slides;\n• delays in moving our mining equipment;\n• railroad delays or derailments;\n• security breaches or terroristic acts; and\n• other hazards or occurrences that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and\nsuspension of operations.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a\nresult of claims for:\n• personal injury or loss of life;\n• damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, including our coal properties\nand our coal production or transportation facilities;\n• pollution, contamination and other environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others;\n• potential legal liability and monetary losses;\n• regulatory investigations, actions and penalties;\n• suspension of our operations; and\n• repair and remediation costs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance for a number of risks and hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured, and\nwe may not be able to recover under our insurance policies, against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a\nsignificant accident in our future coal operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we\nbelieve that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution,\ncontamination and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Moreover, a significant mine accident or\nregulatory infraction could potentially cause a mine shutdown. For example, on July 10, 2022, we discovered that a\nmaterial methane ignition at our Berwind mining complex had occurred. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Methane Ignition at Berwind Mine” for additional information. The\n30\nTable of Contents\noccurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn addition, if any of the foregoing changes, conditions or events occurs and is not determined to be a force\nmajeure event, any resulting failure on our part to deliver coal to the purchaser under contract could result in economic\npenalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or ultimately termination of the agreement, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends\nto our stockholders.\nOur operations are located in a single geographic region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in\na single geographic area, including adverse impacts of weaker conditions associated with climate change.\nCurrently, all of our active operations are conducted in a single geographic region in the eastern United States\nin the Appalachian basin. The geographic concentration of our operations may disproportionately expose us to\ndisruptions in our operations if the region experiences severe weather, transportation capacity constraints, constraints on\nthe availability of required equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural\ndisasters, pandemics (such as COVID-19) or interruption of transportation or other events that impact the region in\nwhich we operate or its surrounding areas. If any of these factors were to impact the region in which we operate more\nthan other coal producing regions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be\nadversely affected relative to other mining companies that have a more geographically diversified asset portfolio.\nIn addition, weather conditions associated with climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of\nstorms, droughts and floods and other severe weather events, may impact our operations, personnel, physical assets,\nsupply chain, distribution chain, access to raw materials such as water and the cost or availability of insurance. If any\nsuch effects were to occur in areas where we or our customers operate, they could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability to mitigate the adverse physical impacts of climate change\ndepends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning.\nThe availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the\ndemand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers.\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply coal to prospective customers. Any\nsignificant delays, interruptions, or other limitations on the ability to transport our coal, including those similar to the\nrail-related constraints we experienced in 2022, could negatively affect our operations. Delays and interruptions of rail\nservices because of accidents, failure to complete construction of rail infrastructure, infrastructure damage, lack of rail or\nport capacity, weather-related problems, governmental regulation, terrorism, strikes, lockouts, third-party actions or\nother events could impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability. In addition,\ntransportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of delivery is a\ncritical factor in a customer’s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs, including increases resulting from\nemission control requirements and fluctuations in the price of locomotive diesel fuel and demurrage, could make our\ncoal less competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants, could impair\nour ability to supply coal to prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several major pieces of mining equipment to produce and transport our coal, including, but not\nlimited to, underground continuous mining units and coal conveying systems, surface mining equipment such as\nhighwall miners, front-end loaders and coal overburden haul trucks, preparation plants and related facilities, conveyors\nand transloading facilities. If any of these pieces of equipment or facilities suffered major damage or were destroyed by\nfire, abnormal wear, flooding, incorrect operation or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair them in a timely\nmanner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and transport coal and materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the MSHA and other\nregulatory agencies sometimes make changes with regards to requirements for pieces of equipment. Such changes could\n31\nTable of Contents\ncause delays if manufacturers and suppliers are unable to make the required changes in compliance with mandated\ndeadlines.\nIf either our preparation plants, or train loadout facilities, or those of a third party processing or loading our\ncoal, suffer extended downtime, including from major damage, or is destroyed, our ability to process and deliver coal to\nprospective customers would be materially impacted, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. For example, in late-2018,\nwe experienced a partial structural failure at one of the raw coal storage silos that feeds our Elk Creek plant in West\nVirginia, which idled our Elk Creek preparation plant for approximately one month. We also experienced a methane\nignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine in the third quarter of 2022, which required the mine to be idled until production was\nrestarted in the first quarter of 2023.\nIf customers do not enter into, extend or honor contracts with us, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nCoal mined from our operations is subject to testing by prospective customers for its ability to meet various\nspecifications and to work satisfactorily in their ovens and other facilities prior to entering into contracts for purchase\n(which are typically short-term orders having terms of one year or less). If we are unable to successfully test our coals or\nenter into new contracts for the sale of our coal, our ability to achieve profitability would be materially adversely\naffected. Once we enter into contracts, if a substantial portion of our sales contracts are modified or terminated and we\nare unable to replace the contracts (or if new contracts are priced at lower levels), our results of operations would be\nadversely affected, perhaps materially. In addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they\nhave a contractual obligation, our revenues could be substantially affected and we may have to reduce production at our\nmines until the customer’s contractual obligations are honored. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the\npayments we receive which could affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\nCertain provisions in typical long-term sales contracts provide limited protection during adverse economic conditions,\nwhich may eventually result in economic penalties to us or permit the customer to terminate the contract.\nFurthermore, our ability to collect payments from prospective customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness\ndeclines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.\nWe do not expect to enter into significant long-term sales contracts, but if we do, price adjustment, “price\nreopener” and other similar provisions typical in long-term sales contracts may reduce protection from short-term coal\nprice volatility traditionally provided by such contracts. Price reopener provisions may be included in our future sales\ncontracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in\nsome instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. Any adjustment\nor renegotiations leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect our profitability. Some annual\nmetallurgical coal contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and many include prices determined by averaging the\nleading spot indexes reported in the market, exposing us further to risks related to pricing volatility.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued solvency and\ncreditworthiness of prospective customers. The number of domestic steel producers is small, and they compete globally\nfor steel production. If their business or creditworthiness suffers, we may bear an increased risk with respect to payment\ndefault. Competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could\nincrease the risk we bear with respect to payment default. We could also enter into agreements to supply coal to energy\ntrading and brokering customers under which a customer sells coal to end-users. If the creditworthiness of any\nprospective energy trading and brokering customer declines, we may not be able to collect payment for all coal sold and\ndelivered to or on behalf of this customer.\nIn addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal that they have a contractual obligation to\npurchase, our revenues will decrease, and we may have to reduce production at our mines until prospective customers’\ncontractual obligations are honored. Our inability to collect payment from counterparties to our sales contracts may\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay\ndividends to our stockholders.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of any future acquisitions, including acquisitions involving\nnew lines of business, with our existing operations, and in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any\nsuch acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing\nassets and business, such as the mineral lease with the McDonald Land Company for coal reserves adjacent to our Elk\nCreek mine complex near Logan, West Virginia. The assets and businesses we acquire may be dissimilar from our initial\nlines of business. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. Our\ncapitalization and results of operations may change significantly as a result of future acquisitions. We may also add new\nlines of business to our existing operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or\nmanagement are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Entry\ninto certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to\nincreased litigation and regulatory risk. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities\nassociated with the acquired business or assets for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification\nprovisions. If an acquired business or new line of business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to\nefficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nTo maintain and grow our business, we will be required to make substantial capital expenditures. If we are unable to\nobtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, we may have to curtail our operations and delay our\nconstruction and growth plans, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we will need to make substantial capital expenditures associated\nwith our mines and the construction of coal preparation facilities which have not yet been constructed. Constructing,\nmaintaining, repairing and expanding mines and infrastructure, including coal preparation and loading facilities, is\ncapital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of coal reserves, and the maintenance of\nmachinery, equipment and facilities, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require substantial capital\nexpenditures. While we funded a significant amount of the capital expenditures needed to build out our mining and\npreparation infrastructure at our Elk Creek property with cash on hand, we must continue to invest capital to maintain or\nto increase our production and to develop any future acquired properties. Decisions to increase our production levels\ncould also affect our capital needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels or\ngenerate sufficient cash flow, or that we will have access to sufficient financing to continue our production, exploration,\npermitting and development activities, and we may be required to defer all or a portion of our capital expenditures.\nIf we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to develop and grow our\nbusiness. To fund our projected capital expenditures, we will be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or\nissue additional common stock or other equity securities. Using cash from our operations will reduce cash available for\nmaintaining or increasing our operating activities and paying dividends to our stockholders. Our ability to obtain bank\nfinancing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial\ncondition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our future debt agreements, as well as by\ngeneral economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19\npandemic.\nIn addition, incurring debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing\nadditional equity securities may result in significant stockholder dilution.\nWe may not be able to obtain equipment, parts and supplies in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at\nreasonable costs to support our coal mining and transportation operations.\nCoal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel, copper, rubber products and liquid fuels\nand requires the use of capital equipment. Some commodities, such as steel, are needed to comply with roof control\n33\nTable of Contents\nplans required by regulation. The prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the\nglobal market. A rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment we use in our operations\ncould impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices and, in some\ncases, may not have a ready substitute.\nWe use equipment in our coal mining and transportation operations such as continuous mining units, conveyors,\nshuttle cars, rail cars, locomotives, and roof bolters. We procure this equipment from a concentrated group of suppliers,\nand obtaining this equipment often involves long lead times. Occasionally, demand for such equipment by mining\ncompanies can be high and some types of equipment may be in short supply. Delays in receiving or shortages of this\nequipment, as well as the raw materials used in the manufacturing of supplies and mining equipment, which, in some\ncases, do not have ready substitutes, or the cancellation of any future supply contracts under which we obtain equipment\nand other consumables, could limit our ability to obtain these supplies or equipment. In addition, if any of our suppliers\nexperiences an adverse event, or decides to no longer do business with us, we may be unable to obtain sufficient\nequipment and raw materials in a timely manner or at a reasonable price to allow us to meet our production goals and\nour revenues may be adversely impacted. We use considerable quantities of steel in the mining process. If the price of\nsteel or other materials increases substantially or if the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies\nwith respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses could increase. Any of the foregoing\nevents could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe experienced rail-related constraints in 2022, which led to higher coal inventory levels at December 31,\n2022.\nWe are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to\nsatisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments.\nWe are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating\nassets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay our\nobligations and to make dividend payments, depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to\nus. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third-party,\nincluding a creditor, or by the law of their respective jurisdictions of formation which regulates the payment of\ndividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to declare or pay dividends.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if the costs of\nfinancial assurance increase materially.\nFederal and state laws require financial assurance to secure our permit obligations including to reclaim lands\nused for mining, to pay federal and state workers’ compensation and black lung benefits, and to satisfy other\nmiscellaneous obligations. The changes in the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to\nbankruptcies involving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their\nresponsibilities under the SMCRA permits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE\nissued a Policy Advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that was intended to discourage authorized states from\napproving self-bonding arrangements. Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, certain states,\nincluding Virginia, had previously announced that it would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation\nobligations under the state mining laws. Individually and collectively, these and future revised financial assurance\nrequirements may lead to increased demand for other forms of financial assurance, which may strain capacity for those\ninstruments and increase our costs of obtaining and maintaining the amounts of financial assurance needed for our\noperations, which may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining this financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and\nbusiness activities. If, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure\nletters of credit indefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, we may not be able to\nobtain permits and production on our properties could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOur mines are located in areas containing oil and natural gas operations, which may require us to coordinate our\noperations with those of oil and natural gas drillers.\nOur coal reserves are in areas containing developed or undeveloped oil and natural gas deposits and reservoirs,\nincluding the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and our Virginia reserves are currently the subject of substantial oil and\nnatural gas exploration and production activities, including by horizontal drilling. If we have received a permit for our\nmining activities, then, while we will have to coordinate our mining with such oil and natural gas drillers, our mining\nactivities are expected to have priority over any oil and natural gas drillers with respect to the land covered by our\npermit. For reserves outside of our permits, we expect to engage in discussions with drilling companies on potential\nareas on which they can drill that may have a minimal effect on our mine plan. Depending on priority of interests, our\noperations may have to avoid existing oil and gas wells or expend sums to plug oil and gas wells.\nIf a well is in the path of our mining for coal on land that has not yet been permitted for our mining activities,\nwe may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase it. The cost of purchasing a producing horizontal or\nvertical well could be substantial. Horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger\noil and natural gas reserves than a vertical well, which would typically result in a higher cost to acquire. The cost\nassociated with purchasing oil and natural gas wells that are in the path of our coal mining activities may make mining\nthrough those wells uneconomical, thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to\npay dividends to our stockholders.\nDefects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct mining operations\non these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of\nany lease upon expiration of its term, upon a default or otherwise, could adversely affect our ability to mine the\nassociated reserves and/or process the coal we mine. Title to most of our owned or leased properties and mineral rights is\nnot usually verified until we make a commitment to develop a property, which may not occur until after we have\nobtained necessary permits and completed exploration of the property. In some cases, we rely on title information or\nrepresentations and warranties provided by our lessors or grantors. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be\nadversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist or if a lease expires. Any challenge to our title or leasehold\ninterests could delay the exploration and development of the property and could ultimately result in the loss of some or\nall of our interest in the property and, accordingly, require us to reduce our estimated coal reserves. Mining operations\nfrom time to time may rely on an expired lease that we are unable to renew. If we were to be in default with respect to\nleases for properties on which we have mining operations, we may have to close down or significantly alter the sequence\nof such mining operations, which may adversely affect our future coal production and future revenues. If we mine on\nproperty that we do not own or lease, we could incur liability for such mining.\nIn any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management’s time from our\nbusiness and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, if we lose any leasehold interests\nrelating to any preparation plants, we may need to find an alternative location to process our coal and load it for delivery\nto customers, which could result in significant unanticipated costs.\nIn order to obtain leases or mining contracts to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects\nexist, we may in the future have to incur unanticipated costs. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate\nnew leases or mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interests in\nproperties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease. Some leases have minimum\nproduction requirements. Failure to meet those requirements could result in losses of prepaid royalties and, in some rare\ncases, could result in a loss of the lease itself.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWhile none of our employees who conduct mining operations are currently members of unions, our business could be\nadversely affected by union activities.\nWe are not subject to any collective bargaining or union agreement with respect to properties we currently\ncontrol. However, it is possible that future employees, or those of our contract miners, who conduct mining operations\nmay join or seek recognition to form a labor union or may be required to become labor agreement signatories. If some or\nall of the employees who conduct mining operations were to become unionized, it could adversely affect productivity,\nincrease labor costs and increase the risk of work stoppages at our mines. If a work stoppage were to occur, it could\ninterfere with operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nA shortage of skilled labor in the mining industry could pose a risk to achieving improved labor productivity, which\ncould adversely affect our profitability.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with at least\na year of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks. The demand for skilled employees sometimes causes a\nsignificant constriction of the labor supply resulting in higher labor costs. When met coal producers compete for skilled\nminers, recruiting challenges can occur and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating\nefficiency and costs. In the event there is a shortage of experienced labor, it could have an adverse impact on our labor\nproductivity and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our coal.\nWe may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\nAccess to international markets may be subject to ongoing interruptions and trade barriers due to policies and\ntariffs of individual countries, and the actions of certain interest groups to restrict the import or export of certain\ncommodities. There can be no assurance that our access to these markets will not be restricted in the future. An inability\nfor U.S. metallurgical coal suppliers to access international markets would likely result in an oversupply of metallurgical\ncoal in the domestic market, resulting in a decrease in prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\nUnder the SMCRA and its state law counterparts, all coal mining applications must include mandatory\n“ownership and control” information, which generally includes listing the names of our officers and directors, and our\nprincipal stockholders owning 10 percent or more of our voting shares, among others. Ownership and control reporting\nrequirements are designed to allow regulatory review of any entities or persons deemed to have ownership or control of a\ncoal mine, and bars the granting of a coal mining permit to any such entity or person (including any “owner and\ncontroller”) who has had a mining permit revoked or suspended, or a bond or similar security forfeited within the five-\nyear period preceding a permit application or application for a permit revision. Regulatory agencies also block the\nissuance of permits to an applicant who, or whose owner and controller, has permit violations outstanding that have not\nbeen timely abated.\nA federal database, known as the Applicant Violator System, is maintained for this purpose. Certain\nrelationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including the following: being an officer or director of an\nentity; being the operator of the coal mining operation; having the ability to commit the financial or real property assets\nor working resources of the permittee or operator; based on the instruments of ownership or the voting securities of a\ncorporate entity, owning of record 10% or more of the mining operator, among others. This presumption, in most cases,\ncan be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or\nindirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted. An ownership and control\nnotice must be filed by us each time an entity obtains a 10% or greater interest in us. If we have unabated violations of\nthe SMCRA or its state law counterparts, have a coal mining permit suspended or revoked, or forfeit a reclamation bond,\nwe and our “owners and controllers,” as discussed above, may be prohibited from obtaining new coal mining permits, or\namendments to existing permits, until such violations of law are corrected. This is known as being “permit-blocked.”\nAdditionally, Yorktown and Mr. Atkins are each currently deemed an “owner or controller” of a number of other mining\n36\nTable of Contents\ncompanies; as such, we could be permit-blocked based upon the violations of or permit-blocked status of an “owner or\ncontroller” of us. This could adversely affect production from our properties.\nWe may be subject to additional limitations on our ability to conduct mining operations due to federal jurisdiction.\nWe may conduct some underground mining activities on properties that are within the designated boundary of\nfederally protected lands or national forests where the above-mentioned restrictions within the meaning of the SMCRA\ncould apply. Federal court decisions could pose a potential restriction on underground mining within 100 feet of a public\nroad as well as other restrictions. If these SMCRA restrictions ultimately apply to underground mining, considerable\nuncertainty would exist about the nature and extent of this restriction. While it could remain possible to obtain permits\nfor underground mining operations in these areas even where this 100-foot restriction was applied, the time and expense\nof that permitting process would be likely to increase significantly, and the restrictions placed on the mining of those\nproperties could adversely affect our costs.\nOur lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours, depriving us of\nthe ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments.\nMineral supply contracts generally do not require operators to satisfy their obligations to their customers with\nresources mined from specific locations. Several factors may influence a lessee’s decision to supply its customers with\nminerals mined from properties we do not own or lease, including the royalty rates under the lessee’s lease with us,\nmining conditions, mine operating costs, cost and availability of transportation, and customer specifications. In addition,\nlessees move on and off of our properties over the course of any given year in accordance with their mine plans. If a\nlessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with minerals from properties we do not own or lease, production on our\nproperties will decrease, and we will receive lower royalty revenues.\nA lessee may incorrectly report royalty revenues, which might not be identified by our lessee audit process or our\nmine inspection process or, if identified, might be identified in a subsequent period.\nWe depend on our lessees to correctly report production and royalty revenues on a monthly basis. Our regular\nlessee audits and mine inspections may not discover any irregularities in these reports or, if we do discover errors, we\nmight not identify them in the reporting period in which they occurred. Any undiscovered reporting errors could result in\na loss of royalty revenues and errors identified in subsequent periods could lead to accounting disputes as well as\ndisputes with our lessees.\nBecause of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in technology development, we face a risk of not being\nable to capitalize on our license or ownership of intellectual property.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by companies developing new\ntechnology and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of our successful ability to commercialize\nintellectual property we own or license must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications\nand delays encountered in connection with the development of new technology with limited personnel and financial\nmeans. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical problems that extend the time\nand cost of product development or unanticipated problems with the operation of the technology.\nTechnology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nThe development of technology associated with our licensed or owned intellectual property will be costly,\ncomplex and time-consuming. Any investment into technology development and commercialization often involves a\nlong wait until a return, if any, is achieved on such investment. We plan to make investments in research and\ndevelopment relating to our owned and licensed intellectual property and technology. Investments in new technology\nand processes are inherently speculative.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSuccessful technical development of technologies associated with intellectual property does not guarantee successful\ncommercialization.\nWe may successfully complete the technical development of technologies associated with our owned or\nlicensed intellectual property, but we may still fail to commercialize that technology at scale or at a cost attractive to the\ntarget industries. Our success will depend largely on our ability to prove the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of the\ndeveloped technology. Upon demonstration, the technology may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or\nthat we believed they would have, or they may be more expensive than anticipated. Furthermore, even if we do\nsuccessfully demonstrate the technology’s capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business\nwith a larger, more established, more proven company than us. Moreover, competing technologies may prevent us from\ngaining wide market acceptance of the technology. Significant revenue from new technology investments may not be\nachieved for a number of years, if at all.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the market.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and for the\nsuccess of our products and our business. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical\nknowledge or other trade secrets by employees or competitors. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop\ntechnologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies and/or products, which could\nresult in decreased revenues. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to\nthe same extent as the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights\nwhich could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of management attention. If we do not adequately\nprotect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our\nbrand and other intangible assets.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and\nharm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe that we infringe the proprietary rights of any third party, but claims of infringement are\nbecoming increasingly common, and third parties may assert infringement claims against us. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual\nproperty rights of a third party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in\nlitigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are required to\nobtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any\nprofit on our products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to our ability to generate\nrevenue or enter into new market opportunities. If any of our products were found to infringe other parties’ proprietary\nrights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our\nproducts to make them non-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\nThe current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that could adversely\naffect our mining operations or cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with\na new “nationally determined contribution” for U.S. GHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least\n50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. participated in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th\nConference of the Parties (“COP26”) held in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, advancing a Global Methane Pledge\nalong with the European Union, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels,\nincluding “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Since its formal launch at COP26, over 100 countries\nrepresenting almost 70% of global GDP have signed. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties (“COP27”),\n38\nTable of Contents\nPresident Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas\nsources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop\nstandards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas.\nVarious state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. The $1\ntrillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of climate-focused\nspending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme weather events, and\nclean energy and transportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 into law. The Inflation Reduction Act provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of\nlow-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. In\naddition, the Biden Administration has taken measures to unwind a number of regulatory rollbacks enacted or proposed\nby the Trump administration, including, among others, the ACE Rule, the NWPR, and the proposed NEPA overhaul. In\naddition, the Biden administration rolled back certain changes to the CCR made by the Trump administration. In January\n2022, the EPA announced several actions with respect to the coal combustion residuals rules, including reiterating that\nsurface impoundments cannot be closed with coal ash in contact with groundwater (in connection with the proposed\ndenial of closure deadline extensions due to failure of a permittee to demonstrate compliance with coal combustion\nresiduals rules – the EPA took final action to deny the request in November 2022) and establishing a federal permitting\nscheme for the disposal of coal ash and establish regulations for legacy coal ash surface impoundments. New, more\nstringent legislation or regulations related to the protection of the environment, health and safety or the reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, as well as changes in the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may\nrequire us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nmining operations, cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal. Such changes could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations restricting or encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty\nconcerning such regulations and increasing public attention toward climate change could adversely impact the\nmarket for coal, increase our operating costs, and reduce the value of our coal assets and our stock price.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There is widespread concern\nabout the contributions of human activity to such changes, especially through the emission of GHGs. Numerous reports,\nsuch as Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have further raised concern about\nthe impacts of fossil fuel combustion on global climate issues. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with\nthe coal industry. First, the end use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is\na source of GHGs. Second, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our\ncustomers is a source of GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent\nGHG than carbon dioxide, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and\nproduction are subject to pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been adopted, made and are likely to continue to be made at the\ninternational, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs, including\nalternative energy requirements, measures promoting renewable energy development, and energy conservation and\nemissions reductions measures, among others. Collectively, these initiatives could result in higher electricity costs to our\ncustomers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel generation, which could in turn adversely impact our\nbusiness. Such initiatives, as well as increasing public attention to climate change more generally, could also result in\ndirect regulation of the GHGs produced by our operations or increase the potential for governmental investigations or\nlitigation. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters—Global Climate Change.”\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with\nthe production of power generation. However, we may seek to sell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation\nmarket in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their\noperations. The extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new\ncoal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the\namount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions,\nincluding any reductions resulting from power plants ceasing operations or switching to fuels that produce fewer GHG\n39\nTable of Contents\nemissions, could decrease demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our\nbusiness and results of operations. We or prospective customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and\nstorage technologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards, and new legislation,\nregulations or international agreements in the future could otherwise result in increased costs to operate and maintain our\nor our customers’ facilities, capital expenditures to install other emission controls at our or our customers’ facilities, and\ncosts to administer and manage any potential climate-related reporting or greenhouse gas emissions trading or tax\nprograms. These costs and capital expenditures could be material and could increase the cost of and reduce demand for\nour products. Relatedly, to the extent others use or develop new technological advances in coal production in response to\nmarket or regulatory pressures to reduce their impact on the environment, we may be placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement new technologies at substantial costs. We may not\nbe able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable\ncost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. See also “—Product alternatives or other\ntechnologies may reduce demand for our products.”\nCurrent and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and\nnatural resources may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our coal operations.\nWe and our potential customers are subject to stringent and complex laws, regulations and other legal\nrequirements enacted by federal, state and local authorities relating to occupational health and safety and protection of\nthe environment and natural resources. These include those legal requirements that govern discharges or emissions of\nmaterials into the environment, the management and disposal of substances and wastes, including hazardous wastes, the\ncleanup of contaminated sites, threatened and endangered plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of\nmining properties after mining is completed, mitigation and restoration of streams or other waters, the protection of\ndrinking water, assessment of the environmental impacts of mining, monitoring and reporting requirements, the\ninstallation of various safety equipment in our mines, remediation of impacts of surface subsidence from underground\nmining, and work practices related to employee health and safety. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory\nMatters.” Examples include laws and regulations relating to:\n• occupational health and safety;\n• emissions to air and discharges to water;\n• plant and wildlife protection, including endangered species protections;\n• the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or other activity has been completed;\n• limitations on land use;\n• mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n• the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n• air quality standards;\n• water pollution;\n• protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered and threatened species, and\nbiodiversity;\n• protection of wetlands;\n• the discharge of materials into the environment;\n• remediation of contaminated soil, surface and groundwater; and\n• the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nComplying with these environmental and employee health and safety requirements, including the terms of our\npermits, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our costs of operations. In addition, there is the\npossibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of environmental laws, judicial interpretations of\nor rulings on environmental laws or permits, or in connection with the investigation and remediation of environmental\ncontamination. For example, the EPA and several of the states where we operate have, or intend to, propose revised\nrecommended aquatic life criteria for discharges of selenium regulated under the CWA, which may be more stringent\nthan current criteria. The comment period for the EPA’s draft Selenium Technical Support Materials, intended to\nprovide implementation support for states for the recommend selenium aquatic life criterion for freshwater ended on\n40\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 3, 2022. Any additional laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and\nlocal authorities, or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of\nthe environment, including those related to discharges of selenium, could further affect our costs or limit our operations.\nSee “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have\nenvironmental contamination, which could expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time\nto time. Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a\ncondition referred to as “acid mine drainage,” or may include other pollutants requiring treatment. We could become\nsubject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-\nup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites\nthat we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability\nfor such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the\ncontamination or other damages, or for the entire share.\nWe maintain coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments as necessary. Such areas and impoundments are\nsubject to extensive regulation. Structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive\ndamage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability\nfor related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. If an impoundment were to fail, we could be\nsubject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.\nOur coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed, constructed, and inspected by our company and by\nregulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards.\nWe must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations, which can be a\ncostly and time-consuming process and result in restrictions on our operations.\nNumerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Our operations are\nprincipally regulated under permits issued pursuant to the SMCRA and the federal CWA. State and federal regulatory\nauthorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these\nauthorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of\nexploration or production operations. In addition, we may be required to prepare and present to permitting or other\nregulatory authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal might\nhave on the environment.\nOur coal production is dependent upon our ability to obtain various federal and state permits and approvals to\nmine our coal reserves. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and\nare often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or\nimpractical, and which may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing mine development or operations or the\ndevelopment of future mining operations. The pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations\nand for ongoing operations to continue mining, particularly CWA permits, can be time-consuming and subject to delays\nand denials. These delays or denials of environmental permits needed for mining could reduce our production and\nmaterially adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants to waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a NPDES\npermit from the appropriate state or federal permitting authority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for\ndischarged pollutants and other terms and conditions, including required monitoring of discharges. Changes and\nproposed changes in state and federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification\nof permits with new or more stringent effluent limits or terms and conditions. See “Business—Environmental and Other\nRegulatory Matters—Clean Water Act.”\nFurther, the public has certain statutory rights to comment on and submit objections to requested permits and\nenvironmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in\n41\nTable of Contents\nthe permitting process, including bringing citizens’ claims to challenge the issuance or renewal of permits, the validity of\nenvironmental impact statements or performance of mining activities. As a result of challenges like these, the permits we\nneed may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or issued or renewed at all, or permits issued or renewed may not\nbe maintained, may be challenged or may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and\neconomically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow, and\nprofitability.\nPermitting rules may also require, under certain circumstances, that we obtain surface-owner consent if the\nsurface estate has been severed from the mineral estate. This could require us to negotiate with third parties for surface\naccess that overlies coal we acquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting\nyears in some instances, which can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate\nfor land access, we could be denied a permit to mine coal we already own.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently\nclosed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’\ndemands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health\nand safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may\nbe required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our\nmines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to\ndeliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If\nthese challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these\nobligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may\ninclude price reductions, the reduction of commitments, the extension of time for delivery or the termination of\ncustomers’ contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are subject to extensive existing and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to\nprotection of the environment, which could negatively impact our business and the market for our products.\nCoal contains impurities, including sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which\nare released into the air when coal is burned. Complying with regulations to address these emissions can be costly for\nour customers. For example, in order to meet the CAA limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants,\ncoal users must install costly pollution control devices, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some of which they may\npurchase), or switch to other fuels. More costly and stringent environmental regulations could adversely impact the\noperations of our customers, which could in turn adversely impact our business. A number of coal-fired power plants,\nparticularly smaller and older plants, already have retired or announced that they will retire rather than retrofit to meet\nthe obligations of these rules.\nIn addition, considerable uncertainty is associated with new air emissions initiatives that may require significant\nemissions control expenditures for many coal-fired power plants. As a result, some of our prospective customers may\nswitch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment\nthat reduces the need for low-sulfur coal. Any further switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-\nfired power plants, or reduced construction of new coal-fired power plants could have a material adverse effect on\ndemand for, and prices received for, our coal. In addition, our coke plant and steelmaking customers may face increased\noperational costs as a result of higher electric costs. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nApart from actual and potential regulation of air emissions and solid wastes from coal-fired plants, state and\nfederal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for\nour coal. Many states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity\nsuppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Possible advances in technologies\nand incentives, such as under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, to enhance the economics of renewable energy\nsources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by\nelectric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities, or current or new\n42\nTable of Contents\nincentives to switch to renewable fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal, thereby\nreducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business, cash flows, results of operations and our ability to pay\ndividends to our stockholders.\nNegative sentiment with regard to our business or our industry as well as activism, consumer preferences, and\ninitiatives aimed at limiting climate change or a reduction of air pollutants could interfere with our business\nactivities, operations and ability to access capital sources, result in reduced demand for our products, and negatively\nimpact our stock price.\nPublic perception of our industry’s contribution to climate change or detractions from the transition to a lower-\ncarbon economy has generated negative sentiment toward our industry and could result in reputational harm to our\nbusiness, lower demand for our products, and increased demand for alternatives to our products. Numerous activist\ngroups are devoting resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the production of or use of coal as a source\nof electricity generation, domestically and internationally. Participants in the coal mining industry are frequently targeted\nby activist groups that openly attempt to disrupt the industry. For example, Greenpeace International filed a letter with\nthe SEC alleging that one coal mining company’s filings relating to a proposed public offering of securities may contain\nincomplete and misleading disclosures regarding the risks of investing in the coal market. On another occasion, the\nSierra Club sent a letter to the SEC stating that it believed a coal mining company may be giving potential investors false\nimpressions regarding risks to its business. Other groups have objected to our RAM No. 1 mine permit application in\nPennsylvania. It is possible that we could continue to be the target of similar actions in the future, including when we\nattempt to grow our business through acquisitions or commence new mining operations. Activist groups have also\nbrought lawsuits challenging the issuance of individual coal leases, historical and pending regulatory approvals, permits\nand processes that are necessary to conduct coal mining operations or to operate coal-fueled power plants. Negative\npublic perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by\nrequirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number\nof government entities and private individuals have sought to bring suit against fossil fuel companies, alleging, among\nother things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or\nalleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to\nadequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers. Private individuals or public entities may also seek to\nenforce laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities in relation\nto climate change or other ESG matters. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could have an adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition. Any such activism could therefore materially and adversely impact our ability to operate our\nbusiness or raise capital.\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including\ninvestment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the\ndivestment of fossil fuel equities; encouraging the consideration of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\npractices and ESG ratings of companies in a manner that may negatively affect coal companies, including increased\nnegative investor sentiment, divestment of securities issued by coal companies and the diversion of investment to other\nindustries; and also pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. For\nexample, certain financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, have taken actions to limit available\nfinancing, insurance and other services to entities that produce or use fossil fuels. Several large investment banks have\nadopted climate change guidelines for lenders. The guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of\nelectric power generation plants, which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal-fired plants.\nThe impact of such efforts and developments may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us,\nadversely impact our access to the capital and financial markets, increase the cost of borrowing, cause a decline in our\ncredit rating, increase the cost or reduce the availability of third-party insurance, increase our retention of risk through\nself-insurance, and limit our flexibility and ability to conduct business development activities. Further, in California,\nlegislation was signed into law in September 2015 to require the state’s pension funds to divest investments in\ncompanies that generate 50% or more of their revenue from coal mining by July 2017. Additionally, Maine passed a law\nin June 2021 requiring the state pension system to divest holdings in coal, petroleum, natural gas and related products by\n2026, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund has and is continuing to divest from coal assets. These efforts\nand developments, as well as concerted conservation and efficiency efforts, could also cause coal prices and sales of our\ncoal to materially decline and could cause our costs to increase.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOther activist campaigns have urged companies to cease financing coal-driven businesses. A number of\ninvestors and asset managers have enacted such policies as a result, including by beginning to exit investments that\npresent high sustainability-related risks, such as thermal coal producers. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect\nthe demand for and price of securities issued by us and impact our access to the capital and financial markets. In\naddition, several well-funded non-governmental organizations have explicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or\neliminate mining and the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. The net effect of these developments is to\nmake it more costly and difficult to maintain our business and to continue to depress the market for coal.\nOur mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at\nactive operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation. In addition, government inspectors in\ncertain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations.\nThe MINE Act and MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health\nand safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the MINE Act and the MINER\nAct are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining\nprocedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control,\ncommunications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. MSHA regularly inspects mines to ensure\ncompliance with regulations promulgated under the MINE Act and MINER Act. In addition, Pennsylvania, West\nVirginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement.\nThe various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations may place restrictions\non our methods of operation and potentially result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or\ncriminal liability for the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity. In\naddition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on safety\nconsiderations under certain circumstances, such as imminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and\nunwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory\nMatters—Mine Safety and Health.”\nThe regulations enacted under the MINE Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely\nexpanded, raising compliance costs and increasing potential liability. These existing and other future mine safety rules\ncould potentially result in or require significant expenditures, as well as additional safety training and planning,\nenhanced safety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter enforcement practices and enhanced reporting\nrequirements. At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and\npolicies will have on our operating costs, but any expansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more\nstringent may have a negative impact on the profitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine\nsafety and health regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely impact our\noperations, financial results and liquidity.\nWe must also compensate employees for work-related injuries. State workers’ compensation acts typically\nprovide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil lawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional\ntorts. In such situations, an injured worker would be able to bring suit against his or her employer for damages in excess\nof workers’ compensation benefits. In addition, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act provides a much broader\nexception to workers’ compensation immunity, allowing an injured employee to recover against his or her employer if\nhe or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which the employer was aware and that was a\nviolation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of lawsuits are not uncommon and\ncould have a significant effect on our operating costs.\nWe have obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes\ncoverage for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of\n1969 and the MINE Act. We perform periodic evaluations of our black lung liability, using assumptions regarding rates\nof successful claims, discount factors, benefit increases and mortality rates, among others. Of note, the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 significantly amended the black lung provisions of the MINE Act by reenacting two\nprovisions, which had been eliminated in 1981. Under the amendments, a miner with at least fifteen years of\n44\nTable of Contents\nunderground coal mine employment (or surface mine employment with similar dust exposure) who can prove that he\nsuffers from a totally disabling respiratory condition is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that his disability is caused\nby black lung. The other amendment provides that the surviving spouse of a miner who was collecting federal black lung\nbenefits at the time of his death is entitled to a continuation of those benefits. These changes could have a material\nimpact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.\nWe have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the assumptions\nunderlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations. The\nSMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of\nand following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the OSMRE or,\nwhere state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under the SMCRA, the appropriate state\nregulatory authority. Our operations are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of\nthe SMCRA through approved state programs. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nIn addition, the SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are\ndeposited in the AML Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The\ncurrent per ton fee is $0.224 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.096 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees\nare currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2034, and on November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure\nInvestment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), which included the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Amendments of 2021,\nextended OSMRE’s statutory authority to collect reclamation fees for an additional 13 years and to reduce the fee rates.\nWe accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating\nmine water discharge where necessary. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the\nestimated future closure costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the\nassumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is\ngreater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected. We are also required to post\nbonds for the cost of a coal mine as a condition of our mining activities.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock may be limited by the\namount of cash we generate from operations following the payment of fees and expenses, by restrictions in debt\ninstruments and by additional factors unrelated to our profitability.\nWe have paid quarterly dividends in the past and may pay additional special and regular quarterly dividends in\nthe future. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the requirements of\napplicable law. The timing and amount of dividends declared will depend on, among other things: (a) our earnings,\nearnings outlook, financial condition, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow, cash\nrequirements and our outlook on current and future market conditions, (b) our liquidity, including our ability to obtain\ndebt and equity financing on acceptable terms, (c) restrictive covenants in our Credit and Security Agreement (the\n“Credit Agreement”) with KeyBank National Association, as the administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto,\nand any future debt instruments and (d) provisions of applicable law governing the payment of dividends.\nThe metallurgical coal industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash, if\nany, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period. Also, there may be a high degree of variability\nfrom period to period in the amount of cash, if any, that is available for the payment of dividends. The amount of cash\nwe generate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will have available for dividends will vary based upon,\namong other things:\n• risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, such as the scope and duration of the\noutbreak, the health and safety of our employees, government actions and restrictive measures\n45\nTable of Contents\nimplemented in response, delays and cancellations of customer sales, supply chain disruptions and\nother impacts to the business, or our ability to execute our business continuity plans;\n• the development of our properties into producing coal mines;\n• the ability to begin generating significant revenues and operating cash flows;\n• the market price for coal;\n• overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic\nand foreign coal, coke and steel;\n• unexpected operational events or geological conditions;\n• cost overruns;\n• our ability to enter into agreements governing the sale of coal, which are generally short-term in nature\nand subject to fluctuations in market pricing;\n• the level of our operating costs;\n• prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions;\n• changes in interest rates;\n• the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and\nclimate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal mining industry;\n• delays in the receipt of, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental\npermits;\n• modification or revocation of our dividend policy by our board of directors; and\n• the amount of any cash reserves established by our board of directors.\nThe amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our net income or loss for the\nperiod, which will be affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities that could reduce or\neliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends.\nIn addition, financing agreements may prohibit the payment of dividends if an event of default has occurred and\nis continuing or would occur as a result of the payment of such dividends.\nIn addition, Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) allows our board of directors\nto declare and pay dividends on the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock either (i) out of our\nsurplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with the DGCL or (ii) in case there shall be no such surplus, out of\nour net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. We may not have\nsufficient surplus or net profits in the future to pay dividends, and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds, surplus\nor net profits to make distributions to us. As a result of these and the other factors mentioned above, we can give no\nassurance that dividends will be paid in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we ceased being an emerging growth company and, as a result, we have incurred and\nexpect to continue to incur significant additional legal and financial compliance costs by complying with increased\ndisclosure and governance requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, as a result of our market capitalization as of June 30, 2022, we became an\naccelerated filer and ceased being an emerging growth company. Therefore, we are subject to certain requirements that\napply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company.\nThese requirements include:\n• the provisions of Section 404 requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an\nattestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n• the requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports\nfiled under the Exchange Act; and\n• the “say on pay” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain\nexecutive officers) and the “say on golden parachute” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote\n46\nTable of Contents\nto approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and\ncertain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\nor the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWe have already incurred significant additional legal and financial compliance costs in connection with our loss\nof emerging growth company status. We expect that our compliance with these additional requirements, including the\nprovisions of Section 404, will continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make\nsome activities more time consuming and costly.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market\ntransactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers\nand employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIt is anticipated that the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company will grant additional\nequity awards to Company employees and directors, from time to time, under the Company’s compensation and\nemployee benefit plans. These additional awards will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, which\ncould adversely affect the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIn addition, our Charter authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or\nseries of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other\nspecial rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of\ndirectors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting\npower or reduce the value of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. For example, we could grant the\nholders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified\nevents or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we\ncould assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete\nwith us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in\nallocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Yorktown-affiliated\nentities) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring coal reserves. The existing positions held by these directors\nmay give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become\naware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which\nthey are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential\nbusiness opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest.\nThey may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and\nas a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur Charter and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or\nmerger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock.\nOur Charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board\nof directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. In addition, some\nprovisions of our Charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the\nchange of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n47\nTable of Contents\n• limitations on the removal of directors;\n• limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n• establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the\nboard of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n• providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws;\nand\n• establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our\nboard of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder\nmeetings.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain\ntypes of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability\nto obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum\nfor (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary\nduty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a\nclaim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim\nagainst us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having\npersonal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision does\nnot apply to a cause of action brought under federal or state securities laws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise\nacquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of\nour Charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to\nbring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or\nagents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these\nprovisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or\nproceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our systems and procedures\nfor internal control over financial reporting and the disclosure controls related to them have, and may have in the\nfuture, material weaknesses, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for maintaining systems and documentation necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns. As\ndescribed in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” in this Annual Report, we have determined that certain of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting have material weaknesses. If we are unable to correct those issues in a timely\nfashion, or if other internal control issues arise, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows, and investors could lose confidence in our reported results, thus affecting our ability\nto finance our business. To maintain and improve our controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may\nbe required to hire additional staff and will need to continue to provide effective management oversight, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The material\nweaknesses will not be considered remediated until enhanced controls are implemented and operate for a sufficient period\nof time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. We can give no assurance\nthat the measures we take to remediate the material weaknesses will be effective.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\nHolders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are subject to risks\nassociated with an investment in the Company as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of Class A common\nstock.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe retain legal title to all of our assets and our tracking stock capitalization does not limit our legal\nresponsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders\nof Class B common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to CORE and, in any\nliquidation, holders of Class B common stock and Class A common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of\nour available net assets based on their respective numbers of shares.\nOur Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between the Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of a class of common stock based on past\nperformance.\nOur Board currently expects to attribute 100% of the costs associated with the CORE Assets to Ramaco\nResources and zero such costs to CORE; however, our Board is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets\nand liabilities that are attributed to one class of common stock to another class of common stock, without the approval of\nany of our stockholders. Any such reattribution made by our Board, as well as the existence, in and of itself, of the right\nto effect a reattribution may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of the businesses and assets\nattributed to a class of common stock, including liquidity and capital resource needs to pay the projected dividend to\nholders of our Class B common stock, based on past performance. Stockholders may also have difficulty evaluating the\nliquidity and capital resources of the businesses and assets attributed to each class of common stock based on past\nperformance, as our Board may use the liquidity of one class to fund the liquidity of another class and capital\nexpenditure requirements through the use of loans and interests between classes.\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one class of common stock to pay liabilities attributed to another\nclass.\nThe assets attributed to one class are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to another class, even if those\nliabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other class. No provision of our\nSecond Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended Charter”) prevents us from satisfying\nliabilities of one class with assets of another class, and our creditors will not in any way be limited by our tracking stock\ncapitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock\ncapitalization.\nDividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to quarter. We\ncannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends in the future or what the actual dividends will be for any future\nperiods.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board, the requirements of applicable law, any\nstatutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends, any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable\nto any outstanding preferred stock and commercial factors, whether or not attributable to the CORE Assets. We may lack\nsufficient cash to pay dividends to our Class B stockholders due to cash flow shortfalls attributable to a number of\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as increases in corporate level general and administrative\nexpenses, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, tax expenses, working capital requirements and\nanticipated cash needs. The timing and amount of dividends declared in future periods will depend on, among other\nthings, (a) our earnings, earnings outlook, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow,\ncash requirements and our outlook on current and future market conditions, (b) our overall liquidity, (c) the restrictive\ncovenants in the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and any future debt instruments that we\nmay enter into and (d) provisions of applicable law governing the dividends. We have not established a minimum\ndividend payment for any class of our Common Stock, including our Class B common stock. Further our ability to pay\nand the amount of dividends declared in future periods may be harmed by other risk factors described herein and\nincorporated by reference herein. Our ability to pay dividends may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter, and any\nquarterly estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the factors described above and elsewhere herein.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of the Class B common stock may not reflect the performance of CORE attributed to it, as we\nintend.\nWe cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that the market price of the Class B common stock\nrelated to CORE will, in fact, reflect the performance of CORE attributed to it. Holders of Class B common stock are\ncommon stockholders of the Company as a whole and, as such, are subject to all risks associated with an investment in\nthe Company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of Class B common stock may,\nin part, reflect events that are intended to be reflected by the Class A common stock of the Company. In addition,\ninvestors may discount the value of Class B common stock because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-\nalone entity.\nThe market price of the Class B common stock has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially, and could be affected\nby factors that do not affect traditional common stock.\nTo the extent the market price of the Class B common stock tracks the performance of more focused classes of\nbusinesses and assets than our Class A common stock does, the market price of the Class B common stock may be more\nvolatile than the market price of our existing common stock has been historically. The market price of the Class B\ncommon stock may be materially affected by, among other things:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations CORE’s operating results;\n• potential acquisition activity by the Company (regardless of the class to which it is attributed) or the\ncompanies in which we invest;\n• issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by the Company or the companies in which we invest\nand the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the\nclasses;\n• changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding the Class B common stock, the Class A\ncommon stock or CORE attributable to the Class B common stock;\n• the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of our new\ntracking stock, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment\nin our stocks; and\n• general market conditions.\nUntil an orderly trading market develops for the Class B common stock, the trading price of the Class B\ncommon stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the other assets and\nbusinesses of the Company.\nBecause we are the issuer of the Class B common stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to any of\nour assets and businesses, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, acquisitions\nor dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse market reaction in a particular class of\ncommon stock. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. Certain events may also\nhave a greater impact on one class than the same triggering event would have on another class due to the asset\ncomposition of the affected class. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries\non behalf of one class, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in\nbusinesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of\nbusinesses attributable to our other classes or the borrowing costs of the Company as a whole.\n50\nTable of Contents\nWe may not pay dividends equally or at all on our classes of common stock.\nWe have the right to pay dividends on the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in equal\nor unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on one class of common stock and not pay dividends on another class. In\naddition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to a class will reduce our assets legally\navailable to be paid as dividends on another class.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make decisions that could\nadversely affect only the holders of one class of our common stock.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of one class of\ncommon stock might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of another class of common stock. Our\nClass B common stock is not issued by a separate entity and thus holders of Class B common stock do not have the right\nto elect a separate board of directors. As a result, the Company’s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to the\nCompany as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular class of common stock.\nDecisions deemed to be in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of\na particular class of common stock when considered independently. Examples include:\n• decisions as to the terms of any business relationships between classes of common stock;\n• the terms of any reattributions of assets between classes of common stock;\n• decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Class B common stock and Class A\ncommon stock to be received in connection with a merger involving the Company;\n• decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the classes, especially where the\nopportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both classes;\n• decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one class but\nbeneficial to the other;\n• decisions as to the conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock;\n• decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any interest that\none class of common stock may own in the other class of common stock;\n• decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to any of our\nclasses of common stock;\n• decisions as to the dispositions of assets of any of our classes of common stock; and\n• decisions as to the payment of dividends on any of our classes of common stock.\nOur directors’ or officers’ equity ownership may create or appear to create conflicts of interest.\nIf directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in Class A common stock\nor Class B common stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with\ndecisions that could have different implications for the holders of Class A common stock or Class B common stock.\nWe have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests\namong holders of Class A common stock or Class B common stock. Rather than develop additional specific procedures\nin advance, our Board intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best\nto:\n51\nTable of Contents\n• obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\n• determine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n• determine whether a committee of our Board should be appointed to address a specific matter and the\nappropriate members of that committee; and\n• assess what is in the Company’s best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nOur Board believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any\nsuch circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in\nadvance.\nOur Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE Assets.\nThe Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE\nAssets to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationship between the Company’s overall business and\nCORE with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, loans between the two, attribution of assets, financing\nalternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. Such determinations are in the sole discretion of our Board and\nour Board may at any time change or make exceptions to the relationship between CORE and Ramaco Resources. A\ndecision to change, or make exceptions to, these arrangements could disadvantage one class of stockholder while\nadvantaging the other.\nHolders of a class of common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an\nadverse effect on only that class of common stock.\nPrinciples of applicable law and the provisions of our Amended Charter may protect decisions of our Board that\nhave a disparate impact upon a particular class of common stock. Under applicable law, our Board has a duty to act with\ndue care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, regardless of the class of stock, or series, they hold.\nPrinciples of applicable law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock\nprovide that a Board owes an equal duty to all stockholders and does not have separate or additional duties to any subset\nof stockholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or\nofficers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the business judgment rule. In\nsome circumstances, our directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders\nof a particular series of that stock. Under the principles of applicable law and the business judgment rule referred to\nabove, the holders of Class B common stock may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a\ndisparate impact upon the stockholders of one of our classes if a majority of our Board is disinterested and independent\nwith respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the\nhonest belief that our Board is acting in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nStockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving the\nCompany among holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nOur Amended Charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection\nwith a merger or consolidation involving the Company is to be to the holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock, and none of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will have a separate class\nvote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of applicable law, our Board\nwill seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving the Company\namong holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a fair manner. As the different ways our Board\nmay divide the consideration between holders of the different classes of stock might have materially different results, the\nconsideration to be received by holders of Class B common stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially\nless valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or\nconsolidation.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe may dispose of assets of CORE without the approval of the Class B common stockholders.\nApplicable law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the\nassets of the Company taken as a whole, and our Amended Charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a\nsale of a significant amount of assets attributed to any of our classes of common stock. As long as the assets attributed to\na certain class of common stock proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may\napprove sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such class without any stockholder approval.\nOur Board will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would\nresult in the highest value to holders of any particular class of stock.\nHolders of Class B common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that class than\nif that class were a separate company.\nIf CORE was a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of\nthat sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result,\nstockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than\nthe holders of Class B common stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. In\naddition, we cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that in the event of such a sale the per share\nconsideration to be paid to holders of Class B common stock will be equal to or more than the per share value of that\nshare of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. Further, there\nis no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of Class B common stock. Accordingly, if we sell\nall or substantially all of the assets attributed to CORE, our Class B stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their\ninvestment in our Class B common stock.\nIn the event of a liquidation of Ramaco Resources, holders of Class B common stock will not have a priority with\nrespect to the assets attributed to CORE remaining for distribution to stockholders.\nUnder the Amended Charter, upon Ramaco Resources’ liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock,\ntheir proportionate interest in all of Ramaco Resources’ assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common\nstock in proportion to their respective number of shares. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either class of\ncommon stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Ramaco Resources will have nothing to do with the\nvalue of the assets attributed to the class of common stock or to changes in the relative value of the Class B common\nstock over time.\nOur Board may, in its sole discretion, elect to convert the Class B common stock to Class A common stock, thereby\nchanging the nature of an investment in the Class B common stock and possibly diluting the economic interest in the\nCompany of Class B common stock holders, which could result in a loss in value to such holders.\nOur Amended Charter permits our Board, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock into shares of Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing\nVWAP for each class of stock. A conversion would preclude the holders of Class B common stock from retaining their\ninvestment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of CORE. We cannot predict the impact on\nthe market value of our stock of (1) our Board’s ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this\nconversion right by our Board. In addition, our Board may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of\nour different stocks could cause the stockholders of one group to be disadvantaged.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together and have limited separate voting rights.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, except in certain\nlimited circumstances prescribed under applicable law. When holders of Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes will be in a position to control the outcome of\n53\nTable of Contents\nthe vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one class\nthan another.\nTransactions in Class B common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of those stocks.\nSales of, or hedging transactions such as collars relating to, shares of Class B common stock by any of our\ndirectors or executive officers, could cause a perception in the marketplace that the stock price of the Class B common\nstock has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at the Company or with respect to\nthe Class B common stock. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these\ntransactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of the Class B common stock.\nOur capital structure, as well as the fact that CORE is not an independent company, may inhibit or prevent\nacquisition bids for CORE attributed to the Class B common stock and may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIf CORE were a separate independent company, any person interested in acquiring CORE without negotiating\nwith management could seek control of that class by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a\ntender offer or a proxy contest. Although we intend Class B common stock to reflect the separate economic performance\nof CORE, it is not a separate entity, and a person interested in acquiring that class of common stock without negotiation\nwith our management could obtain control of that class only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of\nthe outstanding voting shares of the Company. The existence of different classes of common stock could present\ncomplexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not\npresent in companies that do not have a capital structure similar to ours.\nCertain provisions of our Amended Charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the\nCompany that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nThese provisions include:\n• authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A common stock and Class\nB common stock;\n• classifying our Board with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain\ncontrol of our Board;\n• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of the stockholders;\n• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board or for\nproposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n• requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our aggregate voting power with respect to\ncertain extraordinary matters, such as an amendment to our Amended Charter (excluding amendments to\nSection 4.1 thereof) or bylaws, and the approval by holders of at least 75% of our aggregate voting power\nfor the removal of a director; and\n• the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including “blank check” preferred stock, which could be\nissued by our Board to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity\nof our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain\ncontrol of the Company.\n54\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax legislation could have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nTax legislation enacted in 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included\ncertain other changes that resulted in a significant reduction of our income tax liability. Congress could, in the future,\nrevise or repeal those changes or enact other tax law changes, such as the elimination of tax preferences currently\navailable with respect to coal exploration and development and the percentage depletion allowance. For example,\nPresident Biden has proposed increasing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28%. We are unable to predict whether\nany such changes will ultimately be enacted, but any such changes could have a material impact on our cash tax\nliabilities, results of operations or financial condition.\nDebt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nOur future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n• our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures or\nother purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n• our funds available for operations and future business opportunities will be reduced by that portion of\nour cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt;\n• our ability to pay dividends if an event of default occurs and is continuing or would occur as a result of\npaying such dividend;\n• we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy\ngenerally; and\n• our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating\nperformance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future\nindebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, investments or\ncapital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory\nterms or at all.\nThe terms of the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other\nindebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, and surety bonding obligations impose restrictions that may limit our\noperating and financial flexibility.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including the\nCredit Agreement, and surety bonding obligations contain certain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to\nincur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person and other restrictions, all of\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and\ntherefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese covenants limit, among other things, our ability to:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of stock or make certain other restricted payments,\nsuch as share repurchases;\n• make capital investments;\n• enter into agreements that restrict distributions from certain subsidiaries;\n• sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n• use for general purposes the cash received from certain allowable asset sales or disposals;\n55\nTable of Contents\n• enter into transactions with affiliates;\n• create or incur liens;\n• merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n• receive dividends or other payments from subsidiaries in certain cases.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may need to\nrefinance existing debt in the future. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture together with the expiration of\nany cure period, if applicable, could result in a default under our indenture. If any such default occurs, subject to\napplicable grace periods, the holders of our Senior Note may elect to declare all outstanding Senior Notes, together with\naccrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. If the obligations under our\nSenior Notes were to be accelerated, our financial resources may be insufficient to repay the Senior Notes and any other\nindebtedness becoming due in full.\nIn addition, if we breach the covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes and do not cure such breach\nwithin the applicable time periods specified therein, we would cause an event of default under the indenture governing\nthe Senior Notes and a cross-default to certain of our other indebtedness and the lenders or holders thereunder could\naccelerate their obligations. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow\nsufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable\nterms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these\ncovenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against\ncompanies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe number and quantity of viable financing and insurance alternatives available to us may be significantly impacted\nby unfavorable lending and investment policies by financial institutions and insurance companies associated with\nconcerns about environmental impacts of coal combustion, and negative views around our efforts with respect to\nenvironmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of our company\nby a significant number of investors or result in the exclusion of our securities from consideration by those investors.\nCertain banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing\nand insurance coverage for the development of new coal-fueled power plants and coal producers and utilities that derive\na majority of their revenue from coal, and particularly from thermal coal. This may adversely impact the future global\ndemand for coal. Increasingly, the actions of such financial institutions and insurance companies are informed by non-\nstandardized “sustainability” scores, ratings and benchmarking studies provided by various organizations that assess\nenvironmental, social and governance matters. Further, there have been efforts in recent years by members of the general\nfinancial and investment communities, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds,\nuniversities and other institutional investors, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by\ncompanies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, or that have low ratings or scores in studies and assessments of\nthe type noted above, including coal producers. These entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing\navailable to such companies. These efforts may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to:\n• restricting our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future;\n• reducing the demand and price for our equity securities;\n• increasing the cost of borrowing;\n• causing a decline in our credit ratings;\n• reducing the availability, and/or increasing the cost of, third-party insurance;\n• increasing our retention of risk through self-insurance;\n• making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing;\nand\n• limiting our flexibility in business development activities such as mergers, acquisitions and\ndivestitures.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating\nresults do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or\nsecurities analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company\nor fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our\nstock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade\nour stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe loss of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in our senior management positions. We may not be\nable to locate or employ qualified executives on acceptable terms. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we\nbelieve that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel\nwith coal industry experience. We may not be able to continue to employ key personnel or attract and retain qualified\npersonnel in the future. Our failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\neffectively operate our business.\nWe could fail to retain customers or gain new ones.\nThe failure to obtain additional customers or the loss of all or a portion of the revenues attributable to any\ncustomer as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacement of contracts or\notherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or\nfinancial loss.\nLike most companies, we have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information\nsystems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, process and record financial and\noperating data, communicate with our business partners, analyze mine and mining information, estimate quantities of\ncoal reserves, as well as other activities related to our businesses. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be\nat greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. Deliberate attacks on, or security\nbreaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties, including systems that collect,\norganize, store or use personal data, or cloud-based applications could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data\nand potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions,\nchallenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational\ndisruptions and third-party liability. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks, breaches to our or our service or equipment\nproviders’ systems could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of time. Our insurance may not protect us against such\noccurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, as cyber\nincidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems and the impact of data privacy regulation could\nmaterially affect us.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our\noperations by causing delays or canceling or impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results,\nresulting in the unintentional disclosure of employee, royalty owner, or other third party or our confidential information,\nor damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, new laws\nand regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly\n57\nTable of Contents\ncomplex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations\n(or contractual provisions requiring similar compliance) could result in significant penalties and legal liability, require us\nto change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As\nnoted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a\nviolation of these laws or may result in significant expense.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a\nparticular period, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation that\nmay be filed against us in the future. In addition, such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAs discussed earlier under General Risk Factors, we have become increasingly dependent upon technology,\nincluding information systems as well as infrastructure and cloud applications and services. These technologies are used\nto operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners,\nanalyze mining information, estimate quantities of coal reserves, and perform other activities related to our business.\nRamaco uses third parties to manage its information technology (“IT”) infrastructure. The Company’s process\nfor assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks includes the following activities, all of which are\nperformed or assisted by third parties with considerable experience providing managed IT and security services or IT\nassurance services:\n• Assessment of cybersecurity risks, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology\nCybersecurity Framework as a guide, as part of the overall IT risk assessment performed annually;\n• Network operations center monitoring to establish baseline metrics and assist with anomaly detection;\n• Periodic vulnerability scanning;\n• Configuration of firewall, antivirus, and malware protection as well as alert thresholds;\n• Generation of system audit logs and recovery backups;\n• Preparation of an incident response plan and assignment of team members;\n• Logical access security reviews for applications and data protection; and\n• Awareness training for employees on cybersecurity threats and safe practices.\nThe Company also uses applications hosted by a reputable third party that are critical to managing Ramaco’s\nbusiness and financial records. The process to oversee and identify cyber risks associated with the third-party service\nprovider involves reviewing its annual System and Organization Controls 2 (“SOC 2”), Type 2 Report as well as\nconducting recurring status meetings with the third party.\nThe responsibility for managing and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats lies with the\nCompany’s IT Steering Committee, which is made up of five members of senior management having legal or corporate\nfinance backgrounds. The committee also includes one lead representative of the third-party IT management and security\nservice providers utilized by the Company to mitigate cybersecurity risks as discussed above. The IT Steering\nCommittee met at least on a quarterly basis during 2023 and intends to meet monthly going forward. Information\nregarding cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts is reported periodically by the IT Steering Committee to the\nCompany’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is primarily\nresponsible for the Board of Directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWe have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents to date that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However,\ncybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity\nincident despite our efforts to protect against such risks. A successful cyberattack could lead to theft of sensitive\ninformation, ransomware, destruction of data, or other issues causing financial, legal, or reputational damage. These\nevents are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, should they occur.\nItem 2. Properties\nSummary Overview of Mining Operations\nInformation concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the\nrequirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our\nmineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year both in the aggregate and for each of our\nindividually material mining properties.\nAs used in this Annual Report, the terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral\nresource,” “inferred mineral resource,” “mineral reserve,” “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are\ndefined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral\nresources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that\nthe indicated and measured mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project. You are specifically\ncautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as\ndefined by the SEC. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”\nYou are cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral\nresources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited\ngeological evidence and sampling and have a too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant\ntechnical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation\nof economic viability. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve. It cannot be\nassumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant\namount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded\nto a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource\nexists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nLikewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be\nconverted to mineral reserves. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”\nThe information that follows relating to the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex\nis derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from, the technical report summaries (“TRS”)\nrelating to such properties prepared in compliance with the Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\nPortions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are not fully\ndescribed herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the TRSs, incorporated herein by reference and made a\npart of this Annual Report.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 2 Properties, Figure 1 below shows the location of our mining properties and offices as of December 31,\n2023:\n60\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, we had five mining properties, as summarized in the table below (tons produced in 000s),\nexcluding the Brook Mine property:\nClean Tons Clean Tons Clean Tons\nControlled Produced Produced Produced Processing Facilities -\nLocation Acres Yrs Stage 2021 2022 2023 Mine Type Quality Transportation\nLogan, High\nElk Underground,\nWyoming, and Volatile\nCreek 20,200 20+ Production 1,981 2,033 2,031 Highwall,\nMingo Counties, A, A/B, Elk Creek Preparation\nComplex Surface\nWV B Plant - CSX RR, Truck\nMcDowell\nCounty, WV, Underground, Low and Berwind Preparation\nBerwind\nBuchanan and 62,500 20+ Production 180 416 601 Highwall, Mid Plant - Truck, Norfolk\nComplex\nTazewell Surface Volatile Southern RR\nCounties, VA\nMcDowell\nCounty, WV, Mid and Knox Creek\nKnox Underground,\nBuchanan, High Preparation Plant -\nCreek 64,050 15 Production 45 235 370 Highwall,\nRussell, and Volatile Truck, Norfolk\nComplex Surface\nTazewell A Southern RR\nCounties, VA\nWyoming and Underground, Berwind Preparation\nMaben Low\nRaleigh 28,000 18 Production — — 172 Highwall, Plant - Truck, Norfolk\nComplex Volatile\nCounties, WV Surface Southern RR\nCommercial High\nRAM Washington\n1,567 n/a Development — — — Underground Volatile Truck, Barge\nMine County, PA\nor Other C\nTotal 176,317 2,206 2,684 3,174\nAt December 31, 2023, we owned or controlled, primarily through long-term leases, approximately 174,750\nacres of coal in Virginia and West Virginia and 1,567 acres of coal in Pennsylvania. The aggregate annual production for\nour properties during the three most recently completed fiscal years are as follows: 3.2 million tons for fiscal year 2023,\n2.7 million tons for fiscal year 2022, and 2.2 million tons for fiscal year 2021. Our preparation plants and loadout\nfacilities are located on properties owned by us or held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next 30 years.\nMost of the leases contain options to renew. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a\nspecific price per ton of coal extracted or as a percentage of coal sales revenue. We believe that all of our leases were\nentered into at market terms.\nThe Company leases office space in Lexington, Kentucky that serves as its executive headquarters. In addition,\nthe Company owns office space in Charleston, West Virginia that serves as an operations center. The Company also\nowns offices in Sheridan, Wyoming. See Item 1. “Business - Our Projects” for additional information about our mining\noperations and CORE initiatives.\nWe hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and\napprovals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. With respect to each facility at\nwhich we produce coal, permits, licenses and approvals are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on\nour mine plans and federal, state, and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our\nhistorical permitting experience, we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits and approvals to\nsupport historical rates of production.\nWe are the operators of the mining and processing operations and the mining methods we use consist of\nsurface, underground and highwall mining methods. The mining operations for the Elk Creek, Berwind, and Knox Creek\ncomplexes are material to our business and are further described below.\n61\nTable of Contents\nElk Creek Complex\nThe Elk Creek Complex is located approximately 45 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia, in Logan,\nWyoming, and Mingo Counties at N 37.698718, W 81.778297. The nearest town is Man, West Virginia, which is\napproximately five miles to the northwest of the Elk Creek Complex. The Elk Creek Complex is within the Southern\nWest Virginia coal field of the Central Appalachia Coal Producing Region (the “CAPP Region”) of the United States.\nCompanies that previously mined on the Elk Creek Complex include Island Creek Coal Company (“Island\nCreek”) which started mining in the area in December 1904. Consolidation Coal Company, now known as Consol\nEnergy, Inc. (“Consol”), bought Island Creek in July 1993 and continued operations in and around the area until the late-\n1990s when Consol idled its Elk Creek Mine. Ramaco Coal bought the property from Consol in 2012 and started\nproduction on the Elk Creek Complex in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2012 purchase included acquisition of rail\naccess, permitted impoundment and coal refuse disposal facilities, as well as numerous reclaimed, but permitted deep\nmines. Pittston Coal Company operated mines on the northern Huff Creek portion (McDonald and Baisden properties) of\nthe Elk Creek Complex in the 1970s and 1980s before the company exited the coal mining business in 2001.\nThe Elk Creek Complex consists of approximately 20,200 acres of leased coal holdings. Within the Elk Creek\nComplex controlled coal holdings, 16,000 acres lie in Logan County, 2,800 acres in Wyoming County and 1,400 acres in\nMingo County. The Elk Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has six active mines, three planned and\npermitted mines, one permitted inactive mine, and one planned but not permitted mine. The five planned and/or\npermitted mines include two contour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner, and three underground room\nand pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development. Ramaco began production of metallurgical coal at\nthe complex in 2016. A majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which results in mining recovery\nof greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the\nhighwall mines have an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Elk Creek Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Chilton A, Upper Dorothy,\nUpper Dorothy 2, 3, and 4, Middle Dorothy, Lower Dorothy, Upper Cedar Grove, Lower Cedar Grove A, Lower Cedar\nGrove B, Lower Cedar Grove C, Upper Alma, Lower Alma, Powellton, Eagle, and No. 2 Gas seams, in descending\nstratigraphic order.\nCurrently, there are six active mines within the complex:\n• Ram No. 1 Surface and Highwall Mine;\n• Stonecoal No. 2 Alma Deep Mine;\n• Rockhouse Eagle Deep Mine;\n• No. 2 Gas Deep Mine;\n• Michael Powellton Deep Mine; and\n• Crucible Deep Mine Lower Cedar Grove B and C seams\nThere are three planned and permitted mines within the complex:\n• Ram No. 3 Surface and Highwall Mine, scheduled for 2024 startup\n• Ram No. 2 Surface and Highwall Mine (which is the extension of Ram No. 1 above), scheduled for\nlate 2024 startup; and\n• Glen Alum Tunnel #1 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2027 startup.\nThere are two permitted inactive mines, the Eight-Kay Deep Mine that is projected to start in 2027 as well as\nthe Monarch Deep Mine that is scheduled to start in 2026. The Bens Creek Deep Mine is planned but is not yet\npermitted. The projected startup date for this mine is 2028. It is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as\nnecessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market\nconditions. With the exception of the Ram No. 3 mine, all planned mines are subject to future Board approval.\nThe current Elk Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (“LOM”) Plan projects mining through 2040; an expected mine\nlife for the complex of 17 years.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAll Run-of-Mine (“ROM”) coal is washed at the Elk Creek Preparation Plant. The Elk Creek Preparation Plant,\nbuilt in 2017 by Raw Resources Group located in Princeton, West Virginia, is a well designed and constructed\npreparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 700 tons per hour. During 2022, we began work on a throughput\nupgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. We completed the expansion in 2023, which raised the nameplate processing\ncapacity to 1,050 raw tons per hour and our annual processing capacity from this complex to approximately three million\ntons per year.\nWe also began development work on additional low-cost, high-volatile underground and surface mines at Elk\nCreek. These mines began production during the second quarter of 2022 and reached full levels of productivity during\n2023. Production increased at Elk Creek during 2023 commensurate with the increase in processing capacity discussed\nabove.\nThe gross book value of the Elk Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $269\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Elk Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Elk Creek Complex produces high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for\nmetallurgical coal from the Elk Creek Complex has been domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne\nmetallurgical coal market. Coal produced from the complex is primarily high-volatile A and high-volatile B\nmetallurgical coal. The Elk Creek Complex also produces thermal coal and specialty coals, which represent\napproximately five percent of sales.\nVolatiles refers to the volatile matter contained in the coal. Classification of coal as low, mid or high-volatile\nrefers to the specific volatile content within the coal, with coals of 17% to 22% volatile matter being classified as low-\nvolatile, 23% to 31% as mid-volatile and 32% or greater as high-volatile. The volatile matter in coal impacts coke yield\n(i.e. the amount of coke and coke by-products produced per ton of coal charged). Low-volatile coal contains more\ncarbon, but too much carbon can result in coke oven damage. Too much volatile matter results in less carbon and\nreduces the volume of coke produced. Therefore, coke producers use blends of high-volatile and low-volatile coals for\ncoke production.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Elk Creek Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nBerwind Complex\nThe Berwind Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of\nRoanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at\nN 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and McDowell\nCounty, West Virginia. The Berwind Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal\nfields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Berwind Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by\nunderground mining methods. Mining within the Berwind/Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and\nthere have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\nThe Berwind Property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of leased coal holdings located in McDowell\nCounty, West Virginia and Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia. Ramaco obtained its initial lease for this property\nin 2015 and commenced mine operations in 2017. The Berwind Complex is in the production stage and currently has\nthree active mines. The three mines that were active at December 31, 2023 are underground room and pillar mines,\nwhich use continuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco started operations at the Berwind Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine in 2017 and idled the mine in mid-July\n2022 due to an ignition that an investigation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) suggests was\n63\nTable of Contents\ncaused by lightning that struck a pilot hole for a new shaft. Production at the Berwind No. 1 Deep Mine restarted in the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nA majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of\ngreater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the highwall\nmine has an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Berwind Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Pocahontas 6, Pocahontas 5,\nPocahontas 4 and Pocahontas 3 seams, in descending stratigraphic order.\nActive Mines:\n• Laurel Fork Pocahontas 3 Deep Mine\n• Triad No. 2 Deep Mine\n• Berwind No. 1 Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine\nPermitted Mines:\n• Squire Jim No. 1 Deep Mine, permitted but not planned for startup\nThe current Berwind Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2049, an expected mine life\nfor the complex of 20+ years. However, it is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from\nresource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Berwind Preparation Plant with no planned direct shipment coal.\nThe Berwind Preparation Plant was initially built in 1955 and commissioned in 1957. Ramaco refurbished the\npreparation plant in 2021 and 2022 based on a design by Ramsey Industrial, with a current ROM processing capacity of\n600 tons per hour.\nThe gross book value of the Berwind Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $155\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Berwind Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Berwind Complex produces high-quality, mid and low-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market\nfor metallurgical coal from the Berwind Complex has been for both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the\nglobal seaborne metallurgical coal market.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Berwind Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nKnox Creek Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of two general properties or areas as follows:\n• Big Creek Property; and\n• Knox Creek Property\nThe Knox Creek Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington,\nKentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell Counties,\nVirginia and McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and\nSouthern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Knox Creek Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by\nunderground mining methods. Mining within the Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and there have\nbeen many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of owned and leased coal holdings. Within\nthe Knox Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 5,370 acres lie in McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek\nComplex is in the production stage and currently has two active mines and two planned and permitted mines. There are\nno active or planned West Virginia mines currently within the Knox Creek Complex. The two active mines include one\ncontour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner, and one underground room and pillar mine, which uses\ncontinuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in 2019. The underground mines will implement\nretreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of 50 to 80 percent. At the surface mine, contour mining has\nan average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and highwall mining has an average mining recovery of\napproximately 40 percent.\nThe Knox Creek Complex is mining or plans to mine several seams and seam splits, including the Jawbone,\nKennedy and Tiller seams.\nActive Mines:\n• Big Creek Jawbone No. 1 Deep Mine\n• Big Creek Surface and Highwall Mine\nPlanned and Permitted Mines:\n• Knox Creek Tiller Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\n• Kennedy No. 3 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\nThe current Knox Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2037, an expected mine\nlife for the complex of 15 years. It is anticipated that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from\nresource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. Both\nplanned mines listed above are subject to future Board approval.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Knox Creek Preparation Plant. The Knox Creek Preparation\nPlant, built in 1981 by Powell Construction Company located in Johnson City, Tennessee, is a well designed and\nconstructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 750 tons per hour.\nThe gross book value of the Knox Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $47\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Knox Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Knox Creek Complex produces high-quality, mid and high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the\nmarket for metallurgical coal from the Knox Creek Complex has included both domestic metallurgical coal consumers\nand the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. The Knox Creek Complex also sporadically produces a minimal\nquantity of thermal coal from the surface mine from oxidized zones.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Knox Creek Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nOther Properties\nRefer to the discussion of our Maben Complex and our RAM Mine under Item 1. “Business - Our Projects” for\ninformation about these properties, which are not included in the disclosures of mineral resources and reserves at\nDecember 31, 2023 to follow.

Our coal resource\nand reserve estimates are based on data obtained from our drilling activities and other available geologic data. Acquisitions\nor sales of coal properties will change these estimates. Changes in mining methods or the utilization of new technologies\nmay increase or decrease the recovery basis for a coal seam. The most recent studies of our coal reserves for the Elk Creek\nComplex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex were prepared by an independent engineering firm, Weir\nInternational, Inc. (“Weir”). In periods between third party updates, we update reserves utilizing our internal staff of\nengineers and geologists based on production data. We intend to continue to periodically retain outside experts to assist\nmanagement with the verification of our estimates of our coal reserves going forward.\nWeir prepared our reserve reporting in compliance with the Regulation S-K 1300 requirements. Weir initiated\nthis process with us by completing a historical project review as well as its validation of our complete drill hole database.\nWeir validated that property control is accurately reflected in reserve modeling, verifying the latest property boundaries,\nincluding control by each seam. Weir also examined reserve boundaries to ensure agreement with mining parameters, such\nas minimum thickness, minimum yield and minimum inter-burden between seams. Resource classification is determined\nbased on the expectation of our meeting these mining parameters. Weir also conducted mining integrity checks to ensure\neach reserve area is minable.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn determining whether our reserves meet this standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential\nability to obtain a mining permit, the possible necessity of revising a mining plan, changes in estimated future costs,\nchanges in future cash flows caused by changes in costs required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and\nobtaining or renewing mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their\neffects on selling prices. Further, the economic recoverability of our reserves is based on market conditions including\ncontracted pricing, market pricing and overall demand for our coal. Thus, the actual value at which we no longer consider\nour reserves to be economically recoverable varies depending on the length of time in which the specific market conditions\nare expected to last. We consider our reserves to be economically recoverable at a price in excess of our cash costs to mine\nthe coal and fund our ongoing replacement capital. The reserves in this Annual Report are classified by reliability or\naccuracy in decreasing order of geological assurance as Proven (Measured) and Probable (Indicated).\nSummaries of the mineral resources and mineral reserves as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are\nshown below. Weir served as the QP and prepared the estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Berwind\nComplex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex. Since a material change has not occurred from the last TRS\nfiled for each complex, the previous years’ TRSs have not been updated. Refer to Exhibit 96.1, 96.2, and 96.3 for access\nto the previous TRS for the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex, respectively.\nYear ended De cember 31, Year ended De cember 31,\n2023 2022\nMeasured Proven + Measured Proven +\n+ Probable + Probable\nIndicated Clean Indicated Clean\nIn-Place Recoverable In-Place Recoverable\n(in millions) Resources Reserves Resources Reserves\nArea\nBerwind Complex 629 23 629 24\nKnox Creek Complex 275 8 301 8\nElk Creek Complex 215 28 215 30\nRAM Mine — — 11 —\nTotal 1,119 59 1,156 62\nEstimates of coal reserves and resources are updated annually to reflect changes resulting from active mine\nproduction, mine plan modifications, property acquisitions/sales, impacts of additional exploration drilling, and any\nother changes that impact remaining coal reserve and resource tonnage.\nThe combined proven and probable reserves at the Berwind, Knox Creek and Elk Creek complexes decreased\nby three million tons due to 2023 production. Measured and indicated coal resources decreased by 37 million tons during\n2023, approximately 25 million tons were due to property control changes (assignment of coal leases) at the Knox Creek\nComplex and 11 million tons were due to the permit denial at the RAM mine and our decision not to pursue an appeal.\nKey assumptions and parameters relating to the mineral resources and mineral reserves are discussed in sections\n11 and 12, respectively, of each TRS.\nExploration Target\nBrook Mine is an exploration property that includes three drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core\ndrillholes. Specifically, targeting REEs has been completed within the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results\nof these drilling programs indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical\nelements such as Yttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these\nminerals within the current Brook Mine permit area.\nThere has been insufficient exploration of the Brook Mine to estimate a mineral resource and it is unclear, at\npresent, whether further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource. The exploration target therefore\ndoes not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms\nare used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInternal Controls\nIn our exploration and mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts, we utilize a certified American National\nStandards Institute third-party laboratory, which has in-house quality control and assurance procedures. Once in possession\nof the samples, the laboratory standard sample preparation and security procedures are followed. After the sample has\nbeen tested, reviewed, and accepted, the disposal of the sample is done in accordance with local, state and EPA approved\nmethods.\nWeir has determined the sample preparation, security and analysis procedures used for our drillhole samples meet\ncurrent coal industry standards and practices for quality testing, with laboratory results suitable to use for geological\nmodeling, mineral resource estimation and economic evaluation.\nYear-end reserve estimates are and will continue to be reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior\nmanagement, and revisions are communicated to our board of directors. Inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves\ncould result in decreased profitability from lower-than-expected revenue or higher-than-expected costs. Actual production\nrecovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenue and expenditures associated with our mining\noperations, may vary materially from estimates.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nDue to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to\ndisputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation,\ndisputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\ncash flows or results of operations. For a description of our legal proceedings, see “Commitments and Contingencies,”\nNote 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters\nOn June 12, 2023, an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by\nshareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, and create a separate Class B common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing\nholders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received\n0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date.\nMarket Information. Our Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market\nunder the symbols “METC” and “METCB,” respectively, and our Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket under the symbol “METCL.”\nHolders. As of the close of business on February 29, 2024, there were 87 holders of record of our Class A\ncommon stock and 76 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Because many of our common shares are held\nby brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders\nrepresented by these holders of record.\nDividends. In addition to the stock dividend discussed above, the Company declared $27.5 million of total cash\ndividends during 2023, which includes $5.6 million under the Company’s single class structure, $17.0 million to Class\nA shareholders, and $3.6 million to Class B shareholders as well as $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the\nvesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units.\nFor holders of Class A common stock, including common stock reclassified to Class A common stock, cash\ndividends were declared quarterly in the amount of $0.125 per share with the exception of the final quarterly dividend,\nwhich was declared in the amount of $0.1375 per share. The Company anticipates declaring cash dividends on a\nquarterly basis at the newly approved amount; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to Board of\nDirectors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nFor holders of Class B common stock, cash dividends were declared in the amount of $0.165 per share and\n$0.249 per share in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. In addition, the Company declared another quarterly cash\ndividend in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the financial statements, in the amount of $0.242 per share of Class\nB common stock. All cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty\nand infrastructure fees for the previous quarter. The Company anticipates continuing to declare quarterly cash dividends\nbased on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add\nexpense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any\ntime without shareholder approval.\nIn regard to stock dividends, such as the initial non-cash distribution of Class B common stock discussed above,\nthere are currently no plans to declare additional dividends payable in stock.\nEquity Compensation Plans. The Company does not have any non-stockholder approved equity compensation\nplans. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 9 for the Company’s equity compensation plan information.\nStock repurchases. The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock that would be\nissuable upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards to pay estimated taxes. The value of common\nstock surrendered by employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of\nrelinquishment. There were no repurchases of common shares during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2023.\n70\nTable of Contents\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present\nfinancial condition and contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected\nperformance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside\nour control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors,” all of which are\ndifficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not\noccur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise\nrequired by applicable law.\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company\nwith 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal.\nOur plan is to continue development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to\napproximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional\ncapital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus\non advantaged geology and lower costs.\nThe overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing,\nregulatory uncertainties and global economic conditions. Coal consumption and production in the U.S. is driven by\nseveral market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar’s strength relative to other\ncurrencies and accelerating production cuts. In addition, blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S.\ncompared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and economic growth remains uncertain in some regions of the world,\nsupply constraints continue to support the global metallurgical coal market overall. Ongoing bans on the import of\nRussian coal have affected the availability of supply to certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in\nprices.\nMetallurgical coal benchmark prices increased significantly in early 2022, but then fell throughout the rest of\nthe year. Market pricing for 2023 was generally down from 2022 levels but remains favorable versus long-term\naverages. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term. In addition, we anticipate that inflation\nmay remain high in the near term for steel prices, freight rates, labor, and materials, which would continue to negatively\naffect our profitability.\nDuring 2023, we sold 3.5 million tons of coal. North American markets made up 33% of our 2023 revenues and\nexport markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 67% of our 2023 revenues. The Company is responsible for rail and\nloadout costs for coal sold into export markets. During 2022, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal. North American markets\nmade up 58% of our 2022 revenues and export markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 42% of our 2022 revenues. We\npurchase coal from third parties for sale for our own account from time to time; however, sales of Company-produced\ncoal made up 95% and 98% of total sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe annual contracting season with North American steel producers generally occurs in late-summer through\nthe fall. As of December 31, 2023, we had entered into forward sales contracts with certain North American customers\non a fixed price basis for 1.4 million tons of coal at an average realizable price of $166 per ton, excluding freight. This\nlevel of pricing in 2023 is lower than the average price of $198 per ton that was obtained during the previous contracting\nseason for North America. This is due to a combination of factors, including changes in demand, variations in the types\nof coal qualities being purchased, fluctuations in steel prices, and other macroeconomic trends. The Company shifted to\n71\nTable of Contents\nmore export sales in the Company’s mix of revenues during 2023, which will likely continue into 2024. Export sales\noften contain index-based pricing and, therefore, greater volatility in pricing and revenues.\nIn 2023, our capital expenditures were $82.9 million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.1 million. In 2022, our\ncapital expenditures were $123.0 million, excluding cash paid for the acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal\nassets which totaled $23.6 million as well as capitalized interest of $1.1 million. The decrease in capital expenditures\nwas due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and Berwind mining complexes.\nWe completed the expansion of processing capacity at the Elk Creek preparation plant in 2023, which now has an\nannualized processing and shipping capacity of approximately three million tons per year.\nOn July 10, 2022, we experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of the active\nmines at our Berwind mining complex. There were no personnel in the mine at the time of the incident and no injuries or\nfatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine costs of $9.5\nmillion recognized during the year. The Company subsequently recognized other income of $8.1 million in 2023 related\nto insurance proceeds received for the event. Production from the Berwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of\n2023.\nAs a result of the increase in capacity at the Elk Creek plant, the re-opening of the Berwind No. 1 mine\ndescribed above, and the start of production at the Maben mine during 2023, the Company was producing just under an\nannualized four million tons per year run rate at the later part of 2023. The Company expects to produce between 4.0\nmillion and 4.4 million tons in 2024 depending on market conditions.\nOn June 21, 2023, the Company distributed Class B common stock, a tracking stock, to provide existing holders\nof the Company’s common stock an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s\nCORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were\nacquired initially by the Company as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the\nCompany’s current expectations:\n• Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we\nbelieve approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox\nCreek,\n• Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of\nloaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n• Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\nThe Company anticipates paying a quarterly cash dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any\ndividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Dividends\npaid on the tracking stock allow the Company to return to Class B common stockholders a portion of the savings from\nroyalties and infrastructure usage fees resulting from the acquisition of Ramaco Coal. In addition, the tracking stock\nprovides an opportunity for Class B common stockholders to participate directly in the potential revenue growth\nassociated with the development of carbon products and rare earth elements. The Company paid cash dividends on Class\nB common stock during the third and fourth quarter of 2023.\nSeparate financial statements for CORE have not been included as exhibits to this filing since CORE’s financial\nperformance and dividends will be evaluated based on non-cost-bearing revenue streams, at least initially, and other\npotential forms of passive income rather than reduced by allocated costs and expenses.\nThe Company continues to assess its potential REEs deposit in Wyoming. To date, the results of drilling\nprograms indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical elements such as\nYttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. The exploration target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, a\nmineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. The Company also\ncontinues its work to advance new carbon product technologies with the goal of commercializing products that use coal\nin both an improved economic and environmental manner.\n72\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYears en d ed Decem b er 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) 493,793 332,960 195,412\nAsset retirement obligations accretion 1,403 1,115 615\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 48,831 40,032 21,629\nTotal costs and expenses 598,279 415,301 243,861\nOperating income 95,245 150,387 39,533\nOther income (expense), net 18,321 2,637 7,429\nInterest expense, net (8,903) (6,829) (2,556)\nIncome before tax 104,663 146,195 44,406\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nEarnings per common share\nBasic - Single class (through 6/20/2023) $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.06 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.77 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.42 $ — $ —\nDiluted - Single class (through 6/20/23) $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.03 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.73 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.40 $ — $ —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNet income and Adjusted EBITDA were lower in 2023 compared to 2022, despite the increase in sales volume,\ndue to lower sales pricing and higher cost per ton sold in 2023. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 benefitted\nfrom $15.9 million of pre-tax income for proceeds received from insurance claims related to the 2022 Berwind ignition\nevent and 2018 silo failure. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for an explanation of the Company’s\ncalculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue. Our revenue includes sales to customers of Company-produced coal as well as smaller amounts of\ncoal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for transportation to our customers within revenue\nand transportation costs incurred within cost of sales.\n73\nTable of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had revenue of $693.5 million from the sale of 3.5 million tons of\ncoal. During 2022, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal for total revenue of $565.7 million.\nCoal sales information is summarized below:\nYea r e nd ed Decemb er 31 ,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 Increase\nRevenue:\nCompany Produced\nCoal sales revenue $ 657,090 $ 553,830 $ 103,260\nTons sold 3,299 2,396 903\nCompany-produced revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 199 $ 231 $ (32)\nPurchased from Third Parties\nCoal sales revenue $ 36,434 $ 11,858 $ 24,576\nTons sold 156 54 102\nPurchased coal revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 234 $ 220 $ 14\nTotals\nCoal sales revenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 127,836\nTons sold 3,455 2,450 1,005\nTotal revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 201 $ 231 $ (30)\nCost of Sales:\nCompany Produced\nCost of sales $ 468,992 $ 323,550 $ 145,442\nTons sold 3,299 2,396 903\nCompany-produced cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 142 $ 135 $ 7\nPurchased from Third Parties\nCost of sales $ 24,801 $ 9,410 $ 15,391\nTons sold 156 54 102\nPurchased coal cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 159 $ 174 $ (15)\nTotals\nCost of sales $ 493,793 $ 332,960 $ 160,833\nTons sold 3,455 2,450 1,005\nTotal cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 143 $ 136 $ 7\nRefer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for supplemental calculations of\nrevenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine)\nCoal sales revenue for 2023 increased 23% from 2022, which was driven by the 41% increase in tons sold. The\nincrease in sales volume was due to greater export sales and was aided by the Company’s increased capacity for\nproduction achieved during 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13% from $231 per ton in 2022 to $201 per ton in\n2023. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage,\ndecreased 18% from $207 per ton in 2022 to $170 per ton in 2023 including company-produced coal and purchased coal.\nThe decrease in both revenue per ton sold measures in 2023 was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for\nexport sales.\nRefer to Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Concentrations and Note 11—Revenues in\nItem 8, Part II for additional information regarding sales to customers.\nCost of sales. Our cost of sales increased 48% from 2022, which was driven by the increase in tons sold\ndiscussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold increased 5% from $136 per ton in 2022 to $143 per ton in 2023. Cash cost\nper ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs and idle mine costs, increased 3%\nfrom $108 per ton in 2022 to $111 per ton in 2023, including company-produced coal and purchased coal. The increase\nin both cost per ton sold measures in 2023 was primarily due to inflationary pressures on labor and supplies.\n74\nTable of Contents\nAsset retirement obligation accretion. ARO accretion was $1.4 million for 2023 and $1.1 million for 2022. The\nhigher level of accretion in 2023 was driven primarily by changes in estimates of future cash flows.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $54.3\nmillion in 2023 compared to $41.2 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 occurred across all asset classes consistent with\nthe Company’s initiative to grow production.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $48.8 million\nfor 2023 compared to $40.0 million for 2022. The 22% increase in 2023 was primarily due to greater compensation-\nrelated expenses and headcount as well as increased spending for professional services consistent with the Company’s\ngrowth efforts.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $18.3 million in 2023 compared to $2.6 million in 2022.\nThe activity in 2023 was related mostly to insurance proceeds received in 2023 related to the 2022 Berwind ignition\nevent that occurred in 2022 and the silo failure that occurred in 2018. The Company received proceeds of $17.0 million\nduring 2023 and had accrued a recovery asset of $1.1 million in the previous period; thus, a gain of $15.9 million was\nrecognized in 2023. This activity is not indicative of expected future results. The activity in 2022 was driven by the gain\nof $2.1 million recognized on the sale of mineral rights.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was approximately $8.9 million in 2023 as compared to $6.8 million\nin 2022. The increase in net interest expense in 2023 was primarily due to increased use of the revolving credit facility\nduring 2023.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized income tax expense of $22.4 million and $30.2 million in 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The lower amount in 2023 was largely due to the decrease in income before taxes. Refer to Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of\ndifferences versus the statutory rate of 21%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nPlease see Part I, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\" in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operation for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management\nand external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We\nbelieve Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation; depreciation,\ndepletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; certain non-operating expenses (charitable contributions); and\naccretion of asset retirement obligations. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below.\n75\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be\ncomparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nYears en d ed Decemb er 3 1,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nInterest expense, net 8,903 6,829 2,556\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nEBITDA 167,818 194,218 73,167\nStock-based compensation 12,905 8,222 5,260\nOther non-operating expenses — 1,000 —\nAccretion of asset retirement obligation 1,403 1,115 615\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNon-GAAP revenue per ton sold. Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales\nrevenue less transportation revenues and demurrage, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine)\nprovides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar\nmeasures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period\nto period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at\nthese measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance.

The Company expects to satisfy\napproximately 88% of these commitments in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. Sales commitments of another 0.4 million\ntons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023 for delivery in 2024. We expect the shift to more export sales in\nthe Company’s mix of revenue that occurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues\ndue to index-based pricing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash is proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers. Our primary uses of\ncash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, acquisitions, royalty payments, and other operating\nexpenditures.\nCash flow information is as follows:\nYea rs en ded Decemb er 3 1,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nConsolidated statement of cash flow data:\nCash flows provided by operating activities $ 161,036 $ 187,870 $ 53,340\nCash flows used for investing activities (72,211) (145,708) (59,613)\nCash flows (used for) provided by financing activities (82,517) (28,495) 22,369\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 6,308 $ 13,667 $ 16,096\nCash flows provided by operating activities during 2023 decreased $26.8 million versus the prior year driven by\nlower cash earnings. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable versus the prior year due to a variety of\nfactors, most notably, variations in income tax payments as the Company received an $11.8 million refund in 2023.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2023 decreased $73.5 million versus the prior year primarily due to\nlower capital expenditures and acquisition-related activity of $40.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively. The decrease\nin capital expenditures was due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and\nBerwind mining complexes. The strategic acquisitions Maben Coal and Ramaco Coal, as well as the concurrent sale of\nmineral rights, took place in 2022 and no such transactions occurred in 2023. In addition, the Company received $11.2\nmillion of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to property, plant, and equipment claims from the 2022 Berwind\nignition event and 2018 silo failure.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used for financing activities was $54.0 million higher in 2023 versus 2022, which was driven by\ngreater repayment of debts and similar financings including $25.0 million and $9.6 million related to the Ramaco Coal\nand Maben Coal asset acquisitions, respectively. In addition, the Company also paid $5.8 million more cash dividends\nduring 2023, which was largely due to $3.6 million of cash dividends paid on Class B common stock that was initially\ndistributed in 2023, as part of the Company’s strategy to increase value for its shareholders. The Company declared an\nadditional quarterly cash dividend for holders of Class B common stock in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the\nfinancial statements, in the amount of $0.242 per share of Class B common stock.\nAll cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and\ninfrastructure fees for the previous quarter as shown below.\nThree months ended Three months ended T hree months ended\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30,\n(In thousands) 2023 2023 2023\nRoyalties\nRamaco Coal $ 3,276 $ 3,572 $ 1,351\nAmonate Assets 722 614 752\nOther 14 13 —\nTotal Royalties $ 4,012 $ 4,199 $ 2,103\nInfrastructure Fees\nPreparation Plants (Processing at $5.00/ton) $ 4,432 $ 4,521 $ 3,433\nRail Load-outs (Loading at $2.50/ton) 2,198 2,202 1,726\nTotal Infrastructure Fees (at $7.50/ton) $ 6,630 $ 6,723 $ 5,159\nCORE Royalty and Infrastructure Fees $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\nTotal Cash Available for Dividend for Class B\nCommon Stock $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\n20% of Cash Available for Dividend for Class B\nCommon Stock $ 2,128 $ 2,184 $ 1,452\nRestricted cash balances at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.8 million and $0.9 million,\nrespectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims.

Our indebtedness was comprised of $42.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, $34.5 million of Senior Notes ($33.3 million net of unamortized discounts and issuance\ncosts), $11.4 million of unpaid financing related to the Maben Coal assets acquisition, and $3.0 of various equipment\nloans. Of these amounts, $56.5 million is expected to be repaid in 2024, including $42.5 million of revolver borrowings\nthat were repaid shortly after the balance sheet date using funds from current operations and $11.4 million of acquisition\nfinancing that is contractually due in 2024. The remaining amount of $34.9 million, or $33.7 net of unamortized\ndiscounts and issuance costs, is mostly comprised of the Senior Notes due in 2026.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s outstanding debt decreased approximately $37.0 million in 2023 and was due primarily to the\nrepayment of financing associated with the previous acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal in the amount of\n$40.0 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility increased $17.5 million compared to 2022.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal helps to reduce royalty expenses associated with the Company’s metallurgical\noperations in the Appalachian basin and, along with the acquisition of Maben Coal, complement our existing low-vol\nportfolio, both of which help achieve the Company’s objective of remaining among the lowest cost producers of\nmetallurgical coal in the U.S. In addition, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal includes potential concentrations of rare earth\nelements and is being used to support the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and commercialization of\nadvanced carbon products and materials from coal, both of which provide additional growth opportunities in the future.\nThe financing associated with the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, which was provided by a related party, was repaid in full\nduring 2023.\nRevolver borrowings are typically used for the management of our normal operating cash position. Revolver\nborrowings that were outstanding at December 31, 2023 were repaid in full during January 2024.\nIn addition to the debts discussed above, the Company finances the payment of premiums associated with\nvarious insurance policies. The Company’s liability at December 31, 2023 was $4.0 million, which must be repaid in\n2024.\nThe Company also has various finance leases for mining equipment, which generally include terms from three\nto five years. The Company’s total liability for finance leases at December 31, 2023 was $10.4 million, which includes\n$5.5 million due in 2024 and $4.9 million due thereafter.\nRefer to Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for additional information on indebtedness and leases.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, our available liquidity was $90.6 million, comprised of $42.0 million of cash and\ncash equivalents and $48.6 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. Total\ncurrent assets were in excess of total current liabilities, which included $42.5 million of revolver borrowings repaid in\nJanuary 2024, by $19.7 million. The Company is party to an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash\nequivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard\nagainst potential losses in the financial sector. The Revolving Credit facility, which includes multiple lending parties and\nhas a maturity date of February 15, 2026, provides added flexibility to the Company to pursue our strategic growth\ninitiatives and manage our normal operating cash position as well as withstand potential changes in macroeconomic\nconditions.\nThe terms of the Revolving Credit facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur\nadditional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes,\nmake restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company\nto maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the\nCompany. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $5 million, as determined on a\nmonthly basis, in a dedicated account as well as an additional $1 million in a separate dedicated account to assure future\ncredit availability. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nOur primary use of cash includes capital expenditures for mine development, infrastructure, and equipment as\nwell as ongoing operating expenses and repayment of financing associated with previous acquisitions. As of the date of\nthis Annual Report, we expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the\nreasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and projected cash\n79\nTable of Contents\nflows from operations. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital\nexpenditure program include the following:\n• Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers;\n• Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;\n• Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans;\n• Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities,\nwhich would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from operations; and\n• Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations.\nIf future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new\nmine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new\ndebt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an\naggregate initial offering price of up to $400.0 million, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023. However,\nthe Company has no specific plans to raise capital at this time and no securities may be sold until a prospectus\nsupplement describing the method and terms of any future offering is delivered.\nIn March 2024, Ramaco initiated actions to extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing\nRevolver facility. The Company is targeting a $200 million facility with a $75 million accordion feature and a maturity\ndate of five years from the closing date. The Company hopes to achieve a successful syndication of the new facility\nduring the second quarter of 2024, which would strengthen our liquidity and provide additional flexibility in support of\nthe Company’s strategic initiatives and operations.\nWorking Capital\nAccounts receivable were $96.9 million at December 31, 2023, which increased $55.7 million versus December\n31, 2022 driven by the $67.5 million increase in fourth quarter revenues. Inventories were $37.2 million at December 31,\n2023, which decreased $7.8 million versus December 31, 2022 driven by the logistical and rail challenges we\nexperienced in 2022. Accounts payable were $51.6 million at December 31, 2023, up from December 31, 2022 due to\nincreased spending.\nCapital Requirements\nDuring 2022 we spent $123.0 million for capital additions, over 75% of which related to ongoing growth\nprojects, including the increase in capacity to accommodate higher production levels at the Elk Creek and Berwind\nmining complexes. During 2023 the Company spent $82.9 million on capital additions, a significantly lower amount\nversus 2022, as the Company has made substantial progress in achieving its growth initiatives.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $53-63 million in 2024, which will likely be weighted\nmore toward maintenance capital than growth capital and development projects. The shift toward maintenance capital is\ndue to the Company’s substantial investments in growth projects in previous periods and its progress to date regarding\nthese initiatives. Despite this shift, it should be noted that the Company entered into an agreement during February 2024\nto purchase preparation plant assets for the Maben Complex at a price of $3 million. The Company anticipates spending\nan additional $8 million in capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These assets will be relocated to the Maben\nComplex and reassembled there for future use with the purpose of reducing the cost of transporting current raw coal\nproduction. These assets will also provide the Company with a preparation facility to handle additional future production\nfrom a deep mine complex at Maben should the Company decide in the future to pursue such development.\n80\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2023:\nPaym e n ts due by p er io d\n2 – 3 4 – 5 More than 5\n(In thousands) Total 1 year years years years\nMinimum coal lease and royalty obligations $ 27,195 $ 3,358 $ 6,486 $ 6,316 $ 11,035\nDebt, excluding interest 91,383 56,534 34,849 — —\nInsurance financing 4,037 4,037 — — —\nLeases 11,940 6,075 3,953 1,912 —\nTake-or-pay obligations 20,237 5,612 9,000 5,625 —\nTotal $ 154,792 $ 75,616 $ 54,288 $ 13,853 $ 11,035\nMinimum royalties represent the contractual minimum amounts to be paid monthly, quarterly or annually for\nthe right to access mineral properties and mine certain reserves and resources. The amounts are generally recoupable\nagainst future production royalties to be paid.\nRefer to the previous discussion of Indebtedness above for additional information regarding the Company’s\noutstanding debt, insurance financing, and finance leases. Leases payments in the table above include payments for both\nfinancing and operating leases.\nTake-or-pay obligations represent those liquidated damage obligations as determined by contract volume\nminimums for transportation of coal at the representative rates of transportation or a portion thereof. Additional take-or-\npay commitments for the next annual period were renewed after the balance sheet date and have been excluded from the\ntable above. These commitments are estimated at approximately $14 million based on last year’s average rate.\nAsset retirement obligations have been excluded from the table above. Accounting for asset retirement\nobligations requires a number of estimates, including the amount and timing of payments to satisfy the obligation. The\ntotal liability recognized on the Company’s balance sheet for asset retirement obligations was $29.0 million at December\n31, 2023. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nEstimated payments related to worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations have also been\nexcluded from the table above. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information\nrelated to these obligations. Refer also to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, such as bank letters\nof credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in consolidated\nbalance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, or\ncash flows to result from these arrangements. We primarily use surety bonds to secure our financial obligations related to\nreclamation and other matters. Total surety bonds at December 31, 2023, were $27.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses\nreported for the period then ended.\n81\nTable of Contents\nCoal Reserves. Our coal reserves and resources are generally updated on an annual basis. There are numerous\nuncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of coal reserves and resources, including many factors beyond\nour control. As a result, estimates of coal reserves and resources are by their nature uncertain. Information about our\nreserves and resources consists of estimates based on engineering, economic, and geological data assembled by third-\nparty qualified persons. Information used to determine recoverable reserves and resources include geological conditions,\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, assumed effects of regulations\nand taxes by governmental agencies, assumptions governing future prices, and future operating costs. Each of these may\nin fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves and resources. For these reasons, estimates of\neconomically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classification of these\nreserves and resources based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual\nproduction, revenues, and expenditures with respect to reserves and resources will likely vary from estimates and these\nvariances may be material. Variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures, valuation of coal\nreserves and resources, and amortization and depletion of mine development costs and mineral rights.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We initially recognize as a liability an asset retirement obligation, or ARO,\nassociated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset in the period in which it is incurred or a reasonable estimate\nof fair value can be made, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The initially\nrecognized asset retirement cost is amortized using the same method and useful life as the long-lived asset to which it\nrelates. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.\nThe liability is reduced as the reclamation work is performed and the related costs are applied.\nEstimating the ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a\nliability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions\nand judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and the timing of the related\ncash flows. On at least an annual basis, we review our ARO liabilities and make necessary adjustments for significant\nincreases in disturbed acreage, mining permit changes, significant mine plan revisions, and changes in cost estimates or\ntiming of performance. To the extent future revisions are made to the ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made\nto the related asset.\nOur ARO liabilities at December 31, 2023 were nearly flat versus December 31, 2022 as the accretion of the\nliability during the year and the downward revision to estimates were mostly offsetting. We lowered our inflation per\nyear assumption from 3.75% used in 2022 to 3% in 2023 based on macroeconomic trends. If our assumptions differ from\nactual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we\nincur could be materially different than currently estimated.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational\nillness (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Mine Act.\nThe occupational illness benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such\nbenefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating the future occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits requires management to make estimates\nand judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what\nconstitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the\nultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. These estimates are subject to\nuncertainty due to a variety of factors, including limited Ramaco-specific claim volume and future cost trends. As a\nresult, volatility in future estimates may occur and actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We review our held-and-used long-lived assets for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nAssets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other groups of assets, which is generally at the mine level or at the mining complex level for mines that share\ninfrastructure and/or developed access. Additional judgment may be required for development properties.\n82\nTable of Contents\nEvents and circumstances that may trigger a recoverability assessment include, but are not limited to, a current\nexpectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life,\na significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in the\nphysical condition of the asset(s), and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected.\nWe generally do not view short-term declines in metallurgical coal prices as a triggering event for conducting\nimpairment tests because of historic price volatility. In addition, a temporary idling of operations at a particular mine or\ncomplex may or may not be viewed as a triggering event depending on the remaining life of the mine, the length of time\nthe mine is expected to be idle, and the amount of incremental costs expected to resume operations.\nWhen events or changes in circumstances occur that trigger a recoverability test, the test is performed by\ncomparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its\ncarrying amount. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is\nrecorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, if any.\nWe make various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future cash flows in our assessments of long-\nlived assets for impairment. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the current and long-\nterm business plans related to the long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes. We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the\ndeferred income tax liabilities and assets for future consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial\nstatements or tax returns for each tax paying jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires management to\nmake judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of various agreements and transactions.\nWe initially recognize the effects of a tax position when it is more than 50% likely, based on the technical merits that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination. Our determination of whether or not a tax position has met the recognition\nthreshold depends on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.\nWe provide for deferred income taxes for temporary differences arising from differences between the financial\nstatement and tax basis of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates. A valuation\nallowance may be recorded to reflect the amount of future tax benefits that management believes are not likely to be\nrealized. The assessment takes into account expectations of future taxable income or loss, available tax planning\nstrategies and the reversal of temporary differences. The development of these expectations involves the use of estimates\nsuch as production levels, operating profitability, timing of development activities and the cost and timing of reclamation\nwork. If actual outcomes differ from our expectations, we may record an additional valuation allowance through income\ntax expense in the period such determination is made. The Company had no valuation allowance at December 31, 2023.\nActual income taxes could vary from the estimates and judgments above due to future changes in income tax\nlaw, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income,\nor unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities. These changes could\nhave a significant impact on our financial position.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks.\nThe following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks related to changes in commodity\nprices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\nCommodity Price Risk. Our primary product is metallurgical coal, which is in itself a commodity. Sales\ncommitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature. The Company’s domestic sales\ncontracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and\npricing is often derived from an index. As such, we are exposed to changes in the international price of metallurgical\ncoal.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOur sales commitments as of February 29, 2024 are as follows:\n20 24\nVolume Average Price\nNorth America, fixed priced 1.5 $ 167\nSeaborne, fixed priced 0.2 $ 159\nTotal, fixed priced 1.7 $ 166\nIndex priced 2.2\nTotal committed tons 3.9\nSales commitments of 0.4 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023, which are included in\nthe table above.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and, therefore, we are\nsubject to fluctuations in market pricing. We expect the shift to more export sales in the Company’s mix of revenue that\noccurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues due to index-based pricing. The\nCompany does not currently manage this risk through the use of derivative instruments. We also have exposure to price\nrisk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel, explosives,\nand other items. The Company manages its risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities\nwith our suppliers.\nInterest Rate Risk. We are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates; however, based on the current levels\nof debt and leases, the Company does not attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. we are not overly\nexposed to interest rate risk. The Company has senior unsecured notes with a face value of $34.5 million that mature on\nJuly 30, 2026, unless redeemed prior to maturity, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9% per annum and paid quarterly.\nSome of the Company’s debts may be affected by changes in benchmark interest rates, such as the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maturity\ndate of February 15, 2026, bear interest at either a base rate plus 1.5% or the applicable SOFR plus 2%. The base rate\nequals the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or 3%. The\nCompany’s outstanding financing related to the Maben coal acquisition, which had a balance of $11.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and is due in full in 2024, bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 3% compounded monthly.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk. International sales of coal are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result,\nwe do not have direct exposure to currency valuation exchange rate fluctuations. However, because our coal is sold\ninternationally, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currency of a customer or potential\ncustomer, we may find our coal at a price disadvantage as compared with other non-U.S. suppliers. This could lead to\nour receiving lower prices or being unable to compete for that specific customer’s business. Consequently, currency\nfluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.\n84\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 677) 86\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 92\nConsolidated Statements of Operations 93\nConsolidated Statements of Equity 94\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 96\n85\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash\nflows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 14, 2024,\nexpressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in\nany way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\nCritical Audit Matter – Asset Retirement Obligation Description\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company's asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") liabilities totaled $29.0 million.\nAs discussed in Note 2 and Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company estimates its ARO liabilities for\nfinal reclamation based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash\nspending for a third party to perform the required work. The Company records an ARO asset associated with\nthe discounted liability for final reclamation. The obligation and corresponding asset are recognized in the period\n86\nTable of Contents\nin which the liability is incurred. As changes in estimates occur, the revisions to the obligation and asset are\nrecognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free rate.\nWe identified the valuation of the asset retirement obligation as a critical audit matter because the estimate\ninvolves a high degree of subjectivity and auditing the significant assumptions utilized by management in\nestimating the amount of the liability requires judgment. In particular, the obligation is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow technique and is based upon mining permit requirements and various assumptions\nincluding discount rates, inflation rate, estimates of disturbed acreage and reclamation activities, timing of\nreclamation activities, and third-party reclamation costs.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We evaluated the methodology used, and tested the significant assumptions discussed above and the\nunderlying data used by the Company in its estimate.\n• We compared assumptions including the credit-adjusted risk-free rate and inflation rate to current market\ndata. In addition, to assess the estimates of disturbed acreage, timing of reclamation activities, and\nreclamation costs, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate.\n• We utilized an external specialist to assist in our assessment of the Company's ARO liability. As part of\nthis effort, the specialist performed a selected observation of mine site operations, interviewed\nmanagement’s engineering specialist, assessed the completeness of the mine reclamation estimate with\nrespect to meeting mine closure and post closure plan regulatory requirements by comparing costs to\npermits on selected sites, and evaluated the reasonableness of the engineering estimates and\nassumptions.\nCritical Audit Matter – Class B Common Stock Distribution Description\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company created a separate Class B common stock as\ndiscussed in Note 9 of the financial statements. An initial distribution of this Class B common stock occurred\non June 21, 2023, via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. At the date of\ndistribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share\nof existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of\noutstanding stock-based awards. The holders of the Class B shares have different dividend expectations that\nare subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Also, the Class B shares do not\nrepresent a direct interest in a separate legal entity or direct interest in specific assets.\nThe accounting for this distribution and its effect on other areas of financial reporting involved complex\naccounting considerations including interpretive guidance. The magnitude of the transaction and uniqueness\nof the characteristics of the Class B shares required significant research and judgment regarding accounting\nand disclosure conclusions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We read the related agreements and analyzed the terms of the Class B equity transaction.\n• We evaluated management’s interpretation and application of the relevant accounting guidance in\nrelation to the facts and circumstances involved and the conclusions reached regarding the accounting\ntreatment for this transaction.\n• We evaluated the disclosures surrounding the Class B shares and rights, earnings per share, and fair\nvalue, to ensure these were disclosed in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\n87\nTable of Contents\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022 (such date takes into account the acquisition of\nMCM CPAs & Advisors LLP by Cherry Bekaert LLP effective October 31, 2023)\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ramaco Resources, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because\nof the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives\nof the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or\ninterim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness\nhas been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management identified a material weakness\nrelated to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This\nlack of sufficient documentation does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key\ncontrols to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. This material weakness was considered in\ndetermining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 financial statements,\nand this report does not affect our report dated March 14, 2024, on those financial statements.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of\noperations, equity, and cash flows of the Company, and our report dated March 14, 2024, expressed an\nunqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A–Controls\nand Procedures in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\n89\nTable of Contents\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n90\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and the Board of Directors of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows of Ramaco Resources,\nInc. (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial\nstatements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s\noperations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

(the “Company,” “Ramaco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation formed in\nOctober 2016. Our principal corporate and executive offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices\nin Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost\nmetallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. We believe each of these properties possesses\ngeologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our\ndomestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international\nmetallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s\ninitiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-\ncarbon-based products and materials.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and global economic growth remains uncertain, supply constraints support\nthe global metallurgical coal market. Ongoing bans on the import of Russian coal have affected the availability of supply\nto certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in coal prices.\nNOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)\nand U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated\nbasis for all periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have\nbeen adjusted to conform to current presentation.\nUse of estimates—The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant\nestimates are related to the quantity and value of coal inventories, stock-based compensation, asset retirement\nobligations, occupational disease obligations, evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, quantities and values of\ncoal reserves, depletion and amortization, useful lives, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition—Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of coal through contracts with steel\nproducers usually having durations of less than one year. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the\nterms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. This occurs when control of the coal is transferred to our customers.\nFor coal shipments to domestic customers via rail, control is generally transferred when the railcar is loaded. Control is\ntransferred for export coal shipments to customers via ocean vessel when the vessel is loaded at the port.\nOur coal sales generally include up to 90-day payment terms following the transfer of control of the goods to\nour customer. In the case of some of our foreign customers, our contracts also require that letters of credit are posted to\nsecure payment of any outstanding receivable. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts. Our\ncontracts with customers typically provide for minimum specifications or qualities of the coal we deliver. Variances\nfrom these specifications or qualities are settled by means of price adjustments. Generally, these price adjustments are\nsettled within 30 days of delivery and are insignificant.\nCertain of our contracts with customers include provisions in which the price is derived from an index. If\ncontrol of the goods transfers to the customer in the period before the final price is determined, revenue is recorded\nbased on the estimated consideration to be received. The Company estimates the amount to which it expects to receive\nby reference to forward curve data, if available, and generally does not constrain such estimates for accounting purposes\n96\nTable of Contents\ndue to the short period of time over which the uncertainty is resolved. However, certain estimates of provisional pricing\nfor which no forward curve data was available were constrained at December 31, 2023 due to index volatility.\nFreight Revenue and Expense—Costs incurred to transport coal to the point of sale at the port facility are\nincluded in cost of sales and the gross amounts billed to customers to cover shipping to and handling of the coal at the\nport are included in revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents—We classify all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of\nthree months or less as cash equivalents. Restricted cash balances at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were\n$0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’\ncompensation claims. Restricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the balance sheet. The Company\npools individual bank accounts with the same institution for the purpose of assessing if a bank overdraft exists based on\nthe contractual terms of the arrangement.\nInventories— Coal is reported as inventory at the point in time it is extracted from the mine. Coal inventories\nare valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out inventory\nvaluation method. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment costs, freight, operating overhead,\ndepreciation and amortization. Coal inventory quantities are adjusted periodically based on aerial surveys of coal\nstockpiles. Lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments were not material. Supply inventories are valued at average\ncost. Inventories consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) D ecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRaw coal $ 20,122 $ 22,414\nSaleable coal 12,013 18,223\nSupplies 5,028 4,336\nTotal inventories $ 37,163 $ 44,973\nProperty, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures which extend\nthe useful lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized. Planned major maintenance costs which do not extend\nthe useful lives of existing plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed,\nthe related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on\ndisposition is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCoal exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Coal exploration costs include those incurred to ascertain\nexistence, location, extent or quality of ore or minerals before beginning the development stage of the mine.\nMining property and mineral rights costs represent the costs incurred to acquire the rights to access and mine\ncertain coal property either through deeds, leases, or other conveyance agreements. These costs include the costs of\nacquiring, and accessing mineral reserves, resources and surface areas for mining activities.\nMine development begins when the facts and circumstances clearly establish the presence of a commercial\nmineralized deposit. Capitalized mine development costs represent the costs incurred to prepare mine sites and/or seams\nof coal for future mining. These costs include costs of acquiring, permitting, planning, research, and developing\naccess to identified mineral reserves and other preparations for commercial production as necessary to develop and\npermit the properties for mining activities. When components of capitalized mine development costs are replaced with\nnew components, the Company capitalizes the replacement as a separate component and charges off the net book value\nof the component that was replaced at the cease-use date.\nIf it is determined that an undeveloped mineral interest cannot be economically converted into proven and\nprobable reserves, capitalized costs are assessed for impairment and future development costs are expensed as incurred.\n97\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenditures, including certain professional fees and overhead costs, are not capitalized but are expensed as\nincurred.\nMineral rights and capitalized mine development costs are depleted and amortized on a units-of-production\nbasis as mining of that mine’s assigned reserves takes place. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the\nstraight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to thirty years.\nAdvanced Coal Royalties—In most cases, we acquire the right to mine coal reserves under leases which call for\nthe payment of royalties on coal as it is mined and sold. In many cases, these mineral leases require the payment of\nadvance or minimum coal royalties to lessors that are recoupable against future production royalties. These advance\npayments are deferred and charged to operations as the coal reserves are mined.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets—We review and evaluate held-and-used long-lived assets, including property,\nplant and equipment and mine development costs, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe asset or asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of the asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset\nor asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows,\nan impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, if any. We may, under\nlimited circumstances, idle mining operations in response to certain events or conditions. Because an idling is not a\npermanent closure, it is not considered an automatic indicator of impairment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations—Legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are initially\nrecognized at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to capitalized development costs, at the time they\nare incurred. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming metallurgical\ncoal land and support facilities in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit.\nSpending estimates are adjusted for inflation and then discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. We record the fair\nvalue of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in\nthe carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value over time and the\ncapitalized cost is amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves upon\ncommencement of mining. We review our asset retirement obligations on at least an annual basis for significant changes\nin the estimated timing or amount of cash flows.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational\ndisease (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Federal\nMine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present\nvalue of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating our occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits obligation requires management to make\nestimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing\nwhat constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments\nincluding the ultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. Adjustments to\nestimated liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded immediately in earnings in the period in which\nthe change in estimate occurs.\nOther Income—We recognized $5.4 million associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic\nSecurity Act Employee Retention Tax Credit as other income within the consolidated statements of operations for 2021.\nLeases—We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception, and lease classification is\ndetermined at the commencement date. Leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and\nlease liabilities except for leases with a term of 12 months or less.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term. The\n98\nTable of Contents\nCompany does not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases as permitted under the accounting guidance for\nleases. As most of our leases do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease\npayments at commencement date. The operating and finance lease ROU assets also include lease prepayments made by\nthe Company and are reduced by any lease incentives received by the Company prior to commencement. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. For\noperating leases, lease expense is recorded in the income statement based on a straight-line recognition of the total fixed\npayments over the lease term. For finance leases, accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense and the ROU\nasset is amortized separately on a straight-line basis similar to the depreciation of equipment owned by the Company.\nLeases of mineral reserves and the related land leases are exempted under U.S. GAAP from recognition on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value Measurements— Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the\ninputs utilized in the valuation. The levels of the hierarchy include: Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices in active markets\nfor the identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or\nindirectly observable through market-corroborated inputs; and Level 3 - inputs are unobservable, or observable but\ncannot be market-corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable\napproximate their carrying amounts at each reporting date. The Company’s Senior Notes had an estimated fair value of\n$35.5 million and $36.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair values of the Company’s Senior\nNotes were based on observable market prices and were considered a Level 2 measurement at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the\nCompany’s remaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing\nmarket terms available to the Company. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding debt.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements of the Company include asset retirement obligations and estimated\nvalues used to allocate the acquisition cost of long-lived assets to individual assets, neither of which are subject to the\nfair value disclosure requirements.\nThe fair value of asset retirement obligations is determined as the present value of estimated cash flows related\nto reclamation obligations, which would likely be a Level 3 measurement due to the use of unobservable inputs such as\nestimates regarding the amount and timing of costs to be incurred, inflation rates, and the Company’s credit-adjusted\ndiscount rate.\nThe consideration for the Company’s prior year acquisitions was allocated based on the relative fair values of\nthe assets acquired, the primary asset of which was mineral rights. The fair values of mineral rights were determined\nbased on Level 3 inputs, which are generally unobservable, requiring the Company to make assumptions about future\ncoal prices, capital expenditures, future coal production, costs of production, and an appropriate rate at which to discount\nthe future cash flows.\nIncome Taxes—Income tax expense (benefit) includes Federal and state income taxes. Certain income and\nexpenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary\ndifferences is reported as deferred income taxes. We account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in\neffect at the reporting date of the balance sheet. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the\nrelated tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, we consider the projected\nrealization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company had no valuation allowances on the balance sheet as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n99\nTable of Contents\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We had no uncertain tax positions\nrequiring liability recognition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in various\nstate and local jurisdictions which may be routinely examined by tax authorities. The statute of limitations for\nexamination of the Company’s tax filings by taxing authorities is currently open for tax returns filed for the year 2020\nand thereafter.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest related to income tax matters in interest expense, net, separately from\nthe tax provision recorded in income tax expense on the income statement.\nSegment Reporting—Our properties located in West Virginia and Virginia each consist of mineral reserves for\nproduction of metallurgical coal from both underground and surface mines. These operations are within the Appalachian\nbasin. Geology, coal transportation routes to customers, regulatory environments and coal quality or type are\ncharacteristic to a basin. For financial reporting purposes, these operations represent a single segment because each\npossesses similar production methods, distribution methods, and customer quality and consumption characteristics,\nresulting in similar long-term expected financial performance.\nThe Ramaco Coal acquisition in 2022, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4, provides the Company with\nroyalty savings and controlled mineral rights near Sheridan, Wyoming. This property includes a thermal coal deposit and\npermit and is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling to assess potential concentrations of rare earth\nelements. The property also includes a research and pilot facility related to the Company’s possible expansion into the\nmanufacturing and commercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal. Research and development\nexpenses related to advanced carbon products and materials are not yet material for separate disclosure. Ramaco is also a\nparty to certain collaborative arrangements with government researchers and other organizations, which involve\nproviding in-kind contributions such as ores, samples, feedstock, and services.\nThe activities at the Sheridan property represent a separate operating segment and have economic and\ngeographic differences compared to the Company’s metallurgical operations in the Appalachian basin. Nonetheless,\nthese activities do not meet the significance tests for separate disclosure as a reportable segment at this time.\nThe chief operating decision maker does not regularly review segment asset information for the purpose of\nassessing performance and making resource allocation decisions.\nStock-Based Compensation—Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the grant-date fair value of the\naward and is recognized over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair values of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards having only a service condition were\ndetermined using the publicly-traded price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock\nunits, which vest based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return goals, was determined on the date of grant\nbased on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of stock option awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables\nused in the calculation, including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and service\nperiod.\nConcentrations—Our current operations are all related to metallurgical coal within the mining industry. A\nreduction in metallurgical coal prices or other disturbances in the metallurgical coal markets could have an adverse effect\non our financial results. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 33%, 58%, and 51%, respectively, of our revenue was\nderived from coal shipments to customers in North American markets. The decrease in North American revenue in 2023\nwas due to sales within the United States.\nDuring 2023, sales to three customers accounted for 15%, 13%, and 13% of our revenues, or collectively 41%\nof total revenue. During 2022, sales to two customers accounted for 21% and 17% of our revenues, or collectively 38%\nof total revenue. During 2021, sales to three customers accounted for 30%, 15%, and 13% of our revenues, or\n100\nTable of Contents\ncollectively 58% of total revenue. The number of customers comprising the concentrations above is based on a threshold\nof 10% or more of total revenues.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of\ncash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We monitor the credit ratings and concentration of\nrisk with financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard our cash deposits. In addition, the Company is party to\nan arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no\ngreater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard against potential losses in the financial sector.\nWe have a limited number of customers. Contracts with these customers provide for billings principally upon\nshipment and compliance with payment terms is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding receivables beyond\npayment terms are promptly investigated and discussed with the specific customer. We estimate an allowance for credit\nlosses by taking into consideration the age of past due accounts and an assessment of our customers’ ability to pay. An\nallowance for credit losses was not necessary as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThree customers accounted for 22%, 19%, and 15%, of our trade receivables, or collectively 56% of the\nCompany’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2023. The number of customers comprising the concentrations\nabove is based on a threshold of 10% or more of total accounts receivable.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update\nand Simplification Initiative (“ASU 2023-06”). The amendments in ASU 2023-06 clarify or improve disclosure and\npresentation requirements for a variety of topics, including debt and earnings per share. The effective date for each\namendment in ASU 2023-06 will be the effective date of the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from existing SEC\nregulations, and each amendment should be applied prospectively after its effective date. A material impact to our\ndisclosures is not expected at this time since the Company is already subject to existing SEC disclosure requirements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require incremental disclosures\nrelated to a public entity’s reportable segments and increase the frequency with which most segment disclosures are\nmade. Incremental disclosures required by the ASU include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the segment’s measure of profit or loss, the title and position\nof the CODM and an explanation how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss to assess\nperformance and allocate resources, and the amount and composition of other segment items necessary to reconcile\nsegment revenue, significant expenses, and the reported measure of profit or loss. The ASU also expands interim\ndisclosure requirements such that nearly all annual quantitative segment disclosures will be made on an interim basis and\nrequires that entities with a single reportable segment provide all segment disclosures that are not evident from the\nprimary financial statements, including significant segment expenses, consistent with the approach used by management\nto evaluate performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2024 annual financial statements and on a\nquarterly basis thereafter. Retrospective application is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely occur upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require reporting entities to disclose annual income\ntaxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated\ninformation for individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of total income taxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09\nalso requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign\nincome taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories if the\nquantitative threshold is met. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts and percentages in the annual rate\nreconciliation table, rather than amounts or percentages, and will eliminate certain existing disclosure requirements\nrelated to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective starting with\nRamaco’s 2025 annual financial statements and may be applied prospectively to only the income tax disclosures\n101\nTable of Contents\nprovided for 2025 or retrospectively by providing revised disclosures for all periods presented. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely be\nprovided on a prospective basis in the Company’s 2025 annual financial statements upon adoption.\nNOTE 3—PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant, and equipment consisted of the following:\nDecem be r 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nPlant and equipment $ 290,060 $ 232,885\nMining property and mineral rights 120,532 120,760\nConstruction in process 13,984 34,698\nCapitalized mine development costs 174,260 153,436\nLess: accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (139,745) (111,937)\nTotal property, plant, and equipment, net $ 459,091 $ 429,842\nCapitalized amounts related to coal reserves at properties where we are not currently engaged in mining\noperations totaled $17.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and $33.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\nOn July 10, 2022, the Company experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of\nthe active mines at our Berwind mining complex. The other mines resumed production while the Berwind No. 1 mine\nwas idled until a full investigation could be conducted. There were no personnel in the mine at the time of the incident\nand no injuries or fatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine\ncosts of $9.5 million recognized during the year. Production from the Berwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of\n2023. The Company received $9.2 million of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to this matter, which have been\nreported as part of Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment in the investing activities section of the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and recognized a gain of $8.1 million in Other income (expense), net on the\nConsolidated Statement of Operations in 2023 as the Company had previously accrued a $1.1 million recovery asset at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nMining property and mineral rights are made up primarily of significant asset acquisitions that occurred in 2022\nand 2021. Refer to Note 4 for more information.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization included:\nYear ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nDepreciation of plant and equipment $ 30,913 $ 24,132 $ 17,945\nAmortization of right-of-use assets (finance leases) 8,547 4,846 1,109\nAmortization and depletion of capitalized\nmine development costs and mineral rights 14,792 12,216 7,151\nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 54,252 $ 41,194 $ 26,205\nNOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS\nRamaco Coal\nOn April 29, 2022, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, an entity owned by an investment fund managed by\nYorktown Partners and certain members of the Company's management, was completed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale\nAgreement, dated February 23, 2022. The purchase price was approximately $65 million, consisting of an initial\npayment of $10 million paid at closing and a deferred purchase price of $55 million paid during the remainder of 2022 in\n102\nTable of Contents\n$5 million ratable quarterly installments, and $10 million ratable quarterly installments paid in 2023 plus interest at a\nrate of 9%.\nRamaco Coal controls certain coal mineral interests of principally metallurgical coal properties which are\nowned in fee or leased under long-term leases that are, in turn, leased or subleased to the Company and various third\nparties. Such lessees pay a royalty based on the amount of metallurgical coal mined and the realized price per ton.\nRamaco Coal also controls a large thermal coal deposit and permit near Sheridan, Wyoming covering\napproximately 16 thousand acres, including a research and development facility and associated equipment and has a goal\nof converting coal to carbon products, such as graphene, graphite and carbon fiber.\nConcurrent with this acquisition, the Company and Ramaco Coal each sold certain mineral rights located in\nWest Virginia (the “Split Ridge Arrangement”). To compensate for the sale of these rights, we received an overriding\nroyalty arrangement which included $2 million up front and $125 thousand quarterly minimum royalty payment\nbeginning in January 2024 until December 2028. The fair value of this arrangement was $3.7 million, of which, $1.6\nmillion was treated as an allocation of the fair value of this disposed component of Ramaco Coal and, separately, a $2.1\nmillion gain on the sale of the Company’s mineral rights included in Other income (expense), net on the 2022\nConsolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair\nvalue being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to metallurgical coal deposits. The consideration paid in connection\nwith the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, including $1.6 million in closing costs, relinquishment of $1.6 million of prepaid\nroyalties and $0.1 million paid to a mineral owner as part of the acquisition, was approximately $68.3 million and was\nallocated based on fair values to mining property and mineral rights ($65.1 million), buildings ($2.6 million) and\nequipment ($0.6 million). Refer to Note 7 for a description of the acquisition financing.\nMaben Coal\nOn September 23, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Maben\nCoal, LLC (“Maben Coal”) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 8, 2022, with Appleton Coal,\nLLC. The purchase price was approximately $30.0 million, consisting of an initial payment of $9.0 million and proceeds\nfrom a new two-year loan in the amount of $21.0 million. The Company also paid approximately $1.7 million of\ntransaction costs and recognized liabilities of $1.3 million on the closing date, primarily related to $1.2 million of cash\nbond replacement obligations incurred by the Company as part of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the\nCompany paid off the $1.2 million cash bond replacement obligation to Appleton Coal, LLC, which was included in the\ninvesting activities section of the statement of cash flows. The $1.2 million bond replacement payment was subsequently\nrecovered in 2023, which reduced the cash investment related to this transaction to $10.7 million.\nWe acquired a large coal deposit on approximately 28 thousand leased acres located in Wyoming County and\nRaleigh County, West Virginia. We assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of\nEnvironmental Protection, which authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by\nunderground methods. The property also has issued permits covering an existing haul road, as well as an active refuse\ndisposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the\nclosing date.\nThe acquisition of Maben Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair\nvalue being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to leased metallurgical coal deposits. The total consideration of\napproximately $33.0 million was allocated to mining property and mineral rights ($30.6 million), capitalized mine\ndevelopment costs ($1.0 million), receivable for the right to recover cash bond replacement payments made by the\nCompany as discussed above ($1.2 million, which was received in 2023), and recoupable royalties ($0.2 million). Refer\nto Note 7 for information regarding the acquisition financing.\n103\nTable of Contents\nAmonate Assets\nIn December 2021, we acquired what are referred to as the “Amonate Assets” from Coronado, pursuant to an\nasset purchase agreement. The acquisition, for a total cash consideration of $30 million, included a mine complex\nlocated in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia adjacent and contiguous to the Company’s\nexisting Berwind Complex. The acquisition primarily consists of high-quality, low and mid-vol metallurgical coal\nreserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s Berwind Complex. Also purchased were\nseveral additional permitted mines and a currently idled 1.3-million-ton per annum capacity coal preparation plant. The\nCompany paid an additional $0.6 million in 2023 for transaction-related costs, which was also included in investing\nactivities since the delay in payment was due to administrative reasons rather than financing.\nNOTE 5—ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nWe estimate asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) for final reclamation based upon detailed engineering\ncalculations of the amount and timing of the future cash spending for a third party to perform the required work.\nAmounts recorded related to asset retirement obligations were as follows:\nDecem be r 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of year $ 28,885 $ 22,549\nAdditional asset retirement obligations acquired/incurred 542 1,440\nExpenditures made — —\nAccretion expense 1,403 1,115\nRevisions to estimates (1,870) 3,781\nBalance at end of year $ 28,960 $ 28,885\nNOTE 6—ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nAccrued liabilities at December 31, 2023 consisted of accrued compensation of $14.6 million and various other\nliabilities. Accrued expenses at December 31, 2022 consisted of accrued compensation of $12.1 million and various\nother liabilities. The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to assist eligible employees in providing for their\nfuture retirement needs. Contribution expenses related to the plan totaled $3.1 million, $2.3 million, and $1.2 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOther long-term liabilities were comprised primarily of worker’s compensation and occupational disease\nobligations discussed below.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Obligations\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease\nobligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. Starting in 2023, the Company also\nelected to self-insure employee medical expenses. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant\nlevels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured\nclaims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions. The occupational disease\nbenefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the\nemployees’ applicable years of service. The occupational disease benefit liability was calculated using a discount rate of\n5.3% and 5.6% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate liability for uninsured claims totaled $5.2 million, including\n$2.3 million of occupational disease obligations. Of the aggregate liability, $3.1 million was included in Other long-term\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated aggregate liability for uninsured\nclaims totaled $3.6 million, including $1.5 million of occupational disease obligations.

We are authorized to issue up to a total of 225,000,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock and 35,000,000 shares of Class B common stock as well as 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each\nhaving a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing\nholders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received\n0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar\nactions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards.\nThe distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with\nan opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis,\nseparate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the\nCompany’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets\nconsists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:\n• Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we\nbelieve approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox\nCreek,\n• Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of\nloaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n• Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe Company expects to pay a dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts\ndeclared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to\nCORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without\nshareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and\nif declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and\nto any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nCORE is not a separate legal entity and holders of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the\nassets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all\nrisks and liabilities of the Company as a whole.\nWith respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a\nsingle class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nClass B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE.\nWith respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available\nfor distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred\nstock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B\ncommon stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation.\nShares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or\nassessment by us. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to Class A common stock. The Board\nof Directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into\nClass A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price for\neach class of stock.\nThe initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated\nto be $11.00 per share based on the closing price of Class B shares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of\nthe equity restructuring was a $102.9 million reduction in retained earnings and an increase of $102.9 million to Class B\ncommon stock and additional paid-in capital during the second quarter of 2023. The Company initially distributed\n8,201,956 shares of Class B common shares as well as additional restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance\nstock units discussed below.\nStock-Based Compensation Awards\nOutstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring\ndiscussed above. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable\nadjustments were made in accordance with such terms, as discussed below, based on the same factor of 0.2 for every\noutstanding award. Since there were no changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award classification, no incremental\ncompensation expense resulted.\nOur Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is currently authorized by shareholders for the issuance of awards of\nup to approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 4.6\nmillion shares of common stock available for grant under the LTIP. The one-time distribution of Class B has no bearing\non the authorization under the LTIP.\nIn general, granted but unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of employment, unless an employee\nenters into another written arrangement. However, exceptions exist for certain executives that are entitled to accelerated\nvesting if terminated without cause. Granted but unvested shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or\notherwise encumbered.\n109\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had four types of stock-based awards outstanding: stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, and performance stock units. Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards totaled\n$12.9 million in 2023, $8.2 million in 2022, and $5.3 million in 2021.\nStock Options—We granted options for the purchase of a total of 937,424 shares of our common stock for $5.34\nper share to two executives on August 31, 2016. The options have a ten-year term from the grant date and are fully\nvested. During the third quarter of 2022, options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock options with an intrinsic\nvalue of $0.124 million were exercised, leaving a balance of options to purchase 917,424 shares of common stock at\nDecember 31, 2022. During 2023, stock options of 183,484 shares of Class B awards were distributed to these\nindividuals under the equitable adjustments discussed above. During the fourth quarter of 2023, options to purchase\n168,712 shares of Class A common stock were exercised and stock options for 33,742 shares of Class B common stock\nwere exercised having a combined intrinsic value of $2.6 million. The remaining options outstanding and unexercised at\nDecember 31, 2023 were 748,712 for Class A common stock and 149,742 for Class B common stock, which were in-\nthe-money at December 31, 2023, having a total intrinsic value of $10.9 million. No compensation expense was\nrecognized for these awards in 2023, 2022, or 2021 as the awards became fully vested in previous years.\nThe following table summarizes the remaining stock-based awards outstanding, as well as activity for the\nperiods:\nRestri c te d Stock Restrict ed S tock Units Performa nc e S tock Units\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Grant Average Grant Average Grant\nFor Class A common stock: Shares D ate Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2021 3,741,770 $ 3.98 — $ — — $ —\nGranted 214,363 14.59 248,706 15.65 248,706 22.21\nVested (809,539) 6.57 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (637) 15.65 — — — —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022 3,145,957 $ 4.04 165,803 $ 15.65 248,706 $ 22.21\nGranted 296,115 10.61 518,348 10.61 518,348 18.09\nVested (1,695,234) 3.37 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (38,484) 11.90 — — — —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023 1,708,354 $ 5.66 601,248 $ 11.30 767,054 $ 19.43\nFor Class B common stock:\nInitial distribution of Class\nB awards - June 21, 2023 680,718 136,819 153,404\nVested (339,035) (16,578) —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023 341,683 120,241 153,404\nThe total fair value of awards vested was $19.7 million during 2023, $11.0 million during 2022, and $5.1\nmillion during 2021.\nRestricted Stock—We grant shares of restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees and directors.\nThese shares vest over approximately one to three and a half years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the\nparticipants have voting rights and may receive dividends. Upon vesting, the restricted stock becomes unrestricted\ncommon shares. The fair value of the restricted stock on the date of the grant is amortized ratably over the service\nperiod. At December 31, 2023, there was $3.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\nrestricted stock to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. The fair value of restricted stock awards\nthat vested during 2023 was $14.6 million for Class A awards and $3.6 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the\noutstanding restricted stock awards was $29.3 million for Class A awards and $4.5 million for Class B awards based on\nthe year-end 2023 closing stock prices.\n110\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units—We grant shares of restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key\nemployees. These share units vest ratably over approximately three years from the date of grant. During the vesting\nperiod, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive\ndividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the\nunits vest. Upon vesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will receive one share of common stock for each\nstock unit.\nThe grant date fair values of restricted stock units are recognized ratably over the service period. At December\n31, 2023, there was $5.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units to be\nrecognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested\nduring 2023 was $1.3 million for Class A awards and $0.2 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding\nrestricted stock unit awards was $10.3 million for Class A awards and $1.6 million for Class B awards based on the year-\nend 2023 closing stock prices.\nPerformance Stock Units—We grant shares of performance stock units to certain senior executives and key\nemployees. These share units cliff-vest approximately three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of\ntargeted performance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock\nunits have the potential to be earned from 0% to 200% of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period,\nthe participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend\nequivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest.\nUpon vesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will receive one share of common stock for each stock unit.\nThe Company’s performance stock units were valued relative to the stock price performance of a peer group of\ncompanies, which was based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the performance stock units on the date of\nthe grant is recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2023, there was $8.9 million of total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance stock units to be recognized over the weighted average\nperiod of 1.7 years. The combined intrinsic value of the outstanding performance stock units for both classes, at target,\nwas $15.2 million at December 31, 2023. The value of these awards if the performance period had ended on December\n31, 2023 is estimated at approximately $27 million.\nIn addition, performance stock units granted in 2022 were modified during the first quarter of 2023.\nModifications to these awards were made up primarily of changes in the composition of the peer group as well as\nchanges in the way relative total shareholder return is evaluated against the updated peer group. The modification\nresulted in incremental fair value of $1.2 million, which is recognized as expense over 2023 and 2024.\nPerformance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total\nshareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.\nTaxes Related to Stock Awards—The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock to pay\nestimated taxes upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The value of common stock tendered\nby employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of relinquishment. There\nwere no other repurchases of common shares.\nDividends\nDividends in the amount of $16.6 million, or approximately $0.375 per share on an aggregated basis ($0.125\nper share for three quarterly dividends), were declared and paid to holders of common stock or Class A common stock\nduring 2023. On December 6, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on\nClass A common stock of $0.1375 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024.\nDividends of $6.0 million were accrued in December 2023 for the cash dividend to be paid in March 2024.\n111\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also paid dividends to holders of Class B common stock during 2023 based on 20% of CORE\nroyalty and infrastructure fees. Dividends in the amount of $1.5 million, or approximately $0.165 per share of Class B\ncommon stock, were paid on September 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 1, 2023. Dividends in the\namount of $2.2 million, or $0.249 per share of Class B common stock, were paid on December 15, 2023 to shareholders\nof record on December 1, 2023. Refer to Note 15 for information regarding dividends declared for holders of Class B\ncommon stock subsequent to the date of the financial statements.\nFor the full year 2023, the Company recognized $27.5 million of cash dividends declared against retained\nearnings for all classes of common stock, including $6.0 million of dividends declared in December 2023 to be paid in\nMarch 2024 and $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the vesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock\nunits and performance stock units. For the full year 2023, the Company paid $25.8 million of cash dividends for both\nclasses of common stock, including $5.5 million that were accrued at December 31, 2022.\nFor 2022, the Company recognized $23.1 million of cash dividends declared against retained earnings, or\napproximately $0.52 per share, including $5.5 million that were unpaid as of December 31, 2022. For the full year 2022,\nthe Company paid $20.0 million of dividends, including $2.5 million that were accrued at December 31, 2021.\nNOTE 10—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations,\nexisting technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Generally, such recognition would coincide with a commitment\nto a formal plan of action. No amounts have been recognized for environmental liabilities.\nSurety Bond—In accordance with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that\nreclamation work is completed. We also have a small amount of surety bonds that secure performance obligations.\nBonds outstanding at December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $27.2 million.\nCoal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments—We lease coal reserves under agreements that require\nroyalties to be paid as the coal is mined and sold. Many of these agreements require minimum annual royalties to be paid\nregardless of the amount of coal mined and sold. Total royalty expenses were $35.0 million, $34.2 million, and $18.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These agreements generally have terms\nrunning through exhaustion of all the mineable and merchantable coal covered by the respective lease. Royalties or\nthroughput payments are based on a percentage of the gross selling price received for the coal we mine. Minimum\nroyalty obligations under coal leases total $27.2 million and are broken down as follows: $3.3 million for 2024, $3.3\nmillion for 2025, $3.2 million for 2026, $3.2 million for 2027, $3.2 million for 2028, and $11.0 million thereafter. Refer\nto Note 12 for information regarding related party transactions.\nContingent Transportation Purchase Commitments—We secure the ability to transport coal through rail\ncontracts and export terminals that are sometimes funded through take-or-pay arrangements. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company’s remaining commitments under take-or-pay arrangements totaled $20.2 million, most of which relates to a\nfive-year contract that was entered into during 2023 with a total remaining commitment of $20.0 million. The five-year\ncontract, which runs from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028, includes an annual minimum commitment of $4.5\nmillion. The level of these commitments will be reduced at a per ton rate as such rail and export terminal services are\nutilized against the required minimum tonnage amounts over the contract term stipulated in such rail and export terminal\ncontracts. We recognized $0.8 million of contingent liabilities at December 31, 2023 related to the probable shortfall\nassociated with our annual minimum commitment.\nLitigation—From time to time, we are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of\nbusiness. No amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to any matters.\n112\nTable of Contents\nOn November 5, 2018, one of our three raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial\nstructural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in late-November 2018 restored approximately 80% of our\nplant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing\ncapacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based on\ncertain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed suit against Federal Insurance\nCompany and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the partial silo collapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants\nremoved the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we\nsubstituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the\nmatter commenced on June 29, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia.\nOn July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in our favor for $7.7 million in contract damages and on July 16,\n2021, made an additional award of $25.0 million for damages for wrongful denial of the claim under Hayseeds, Inc. v.\nState Farm Fire & Cas., 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On\nAugust 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or\namend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum opinion and order on the\nmotion reducing the jury award to a total of $1.8 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set aside,\nin its entirety, the jury award of Hayseeds damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the\nmemorandum opinion and order.\nOn April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20,\n2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury’s $7.7 million contract damages verdict. The court further\ndetermined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an amount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that\nwe are entitled to Hayseeds damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded for a new trial on the amount of\nsuch damages after affirming that the original $25 million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023, the Defendants-\nAppellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order\ndated August 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined on\nremand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-\njudgment interest on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the\nFourth Circuit thereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. The matter is now pending before the District Court for\na new trial on damages for inconvenience and aggravation as well as the court’s determination and award of attorney’s\nfees.\nThe defendants fully paid the portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court’s\norder and that portion of the matter is considered closed. The Company recognized a $7.8 million gain during 2023,\nwhich was recorded in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of this amount, $2.0\nmillion was included in Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment as part of investing activities on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the remaining amount was included in operating activities.\nNOTE 11—REVENUES\nOur revenue is derived from contracts for the sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations\nunder the contracts are satisfied, which is at the point in time control is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic\nsales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts,\nand pricing can be either a fixed price or a price derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. Sales completed with\n113\nTable of Contents\ndelivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue. Disaggregated information about our revenue is presented\nbelow:\nYe ar en ded December 31 ,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCoal Sales\nNorth American revenue $ 227,484 $ 328,322 $ 143,946\nExport revenue, excluding Canada 466,040 237,366 139,448\nTotal revenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nFourth quarter 2023 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $1.3 million\nupward adjustment to revenue related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the previous quarter. Fourth\nquarter 2022 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $2.8 million downward\nadjustment to revenue related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the previous quarter. These adjustments\nwere due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.4 million\ntons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $166 per ton and 2.1 million additional tons for contracts with index-\nbased pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy approximately 88% of the committed tons in 2024 and the\nremainder in 2025. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of\ndisclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the revenue recognition guidance when variable\nconsideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\nSales into individual foreign countries equaling or exceeding 10% of our total revenues included Germany and\nCanada, each of which represented 14% of 2023 revenues, as well as Brazil, which represented 10% of 2023 revenues.\nSales into Canada and South Africa were 12% and 10%, respectively, of 2022 revenues.

Therefore, EPS is presented\nfor the Company’s single class of common stock up to the time the tracking stock was issued. EPS is presented\nprospectively under the two-class method starting on the date of initial distribution of the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9\nfor information related to the Company’s tracking stock.\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS is shown on the following page:\n116\nTable of Contents\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Years en de d December 3 1 ,\n2023 2022 2021\nEarnings attribution\nSingle class of common stock (through 6/20/2023) * $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nClass A common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 44,663 — —\nClass A restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 1,897 — —\nClass B common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 3,498 — —\nClass B restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 144 — —\nForfeitable dividends declared on unvested stock-based\nawards 729 — —\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\n* Common stock and restricted stock participated in earnings 1:1\nand are shown on a combined basis through 6/20/2023 consistent\nwith historical presentation\nJan. 1 - June 20, Years ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nEPS data for single class of common stock through\n6/20/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings\nper share * 44,344 44,164 43,964\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 381 532 293\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units — 6 —\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 27 — —\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted\nearnings per share 44,752 44,702 44,257\nEarnings per common share (single class of common\nstock)\nBasic $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nDiluted $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nJune 21, 2023 - December 31, 2023\nClass A Class B\nEPS data for dual-class common stock 6/21/2023 -\n12/31/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 44,663 $ 3,498\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings\nper share ** 42,115 8,428\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 482 111\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units 157 48\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 436 111\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted\nearnings per share 43,190 8,698\nEarnings per common share (dual-class structure)\nBasic $ 1.06 $ 0.42\nDiluted $ 1.03 $ 0.40\n** Does not include unvested restricted stock, which averaged 1.8\nmillion and 0.4 million for Class A and Class B, respectively, for\nthe period June 21, 2023 through December 31, 2023\n117\nTable of Contents\nUnvested restricted stock awards have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as\ncommon shares; therefore, unvested restricted stock is considered a participating security for the purpose of calculating\nEPS. Historically, the Company has shown EPS for its common stock and unvested restricted stock on a combined basis\nsince both instruments participate in net earnings on the same basis and the resulting EPS is typically the same. Starting\nunder the two-class method, the Company reports separately the net earnings allocated away from holders of Class A\nand Class B common stock to holders of unvested restricted stock awards.\nUnvested restricted stock units and performance stock units include forfeitable dividend rights that are subject\nto the vesting conditions of the underlying awards; therefore, these awards are not considered participating securities and\nshould not be allocated undistributed earnings for the purpose of calculating EPS. However, dividends or dividend\nequivalents declared and charged to retained earnings for these awards reduce the amount of net earnings available for\ndistribution to common stockholders and should be reflected as such under the two-class method.\nFor accounting purposes, Class B’s participation rights are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors to add or modify expense allocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine\nCORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the\nCompany’s net earnings shall be allocated to Class B for the purpose of calculating EPS other than actual dividends\ndeclared during the period for the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9 for information regarding dividends declared on Class\nB common stock.\nDiluted EPS was calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For\nperformance stock units, the awards were first evaluated under the contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires\na determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency\nperiod. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method was then\napplied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered potential\ncommon shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and were included in diluted EPS using the\nmore dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a 1:1 basis\nwith common shares, applying the treasury stock method would be antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation\nthat allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class method discussed previously.\nDiluted EPS for the period from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, the period for which a single class of\ncommon stock existed, excluded all outstanding restricted stock units, or 684,151 units in total, because the effect would\nhave been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. In addition, diluted EPS for the same period excluded\noutstanding performance stock units originally granted in 2022, or 248,706 units at target, based on the guidance for\ncontingently issuable shares, which requires exclusion when shares would not be issuable if the end of the reporting\nperiod were the end of the contingency period.\nFor the period from June 21,2023 through December 31, 2023, the Company’s ability to convert Class B\ncommon shares into Class A common shares, as discussed previously in Note 9, is a contingency that will not be\nreflected in the diluted EPS for Class A under the if-converted method until such time that the required Board resolutions\noccur, if ever.\nDiluted EPS for 2022 excluded 248,706 of target performance stock units based on the guidance for\ncontingently issuable shares discussed earlier.\nNOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn February 1, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.2416\nper share of Class B common stock, which will be payable on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1,\n2024.\nIn February 2024, the Company completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be\nrelocated to the Company’s Maben Complex. The purchase price of the plant is $3 million. The Company anticipates\n118\nTable of Contents\nspending an additional $8 million in initial development capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These costs\nwould include amounts related to the relocation, reassembly, and expansion of the facility at Maben.\n* * * * *\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of December 31, 2023, our management,\nunder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules. Based on this\nevaluation, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 were\nnot effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting disclosed below. The Company’s remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting is also discussed below.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management used the criteria described in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, management identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of\nsufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient documentation does not\nallow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating\neffectiveness. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that its internal control over\nfinancial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nCherry Bekaert, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nRemediation Plan. We are currently developing a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which\nwill include assessing, redesigning, and implementing modifications of our internal controls. We will not be able to fully\nremediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and subsequent validation and testing of these\ninternal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles.\nOnce the remediation plan is fully developed, we will be implementing process, control, and documentation improvements\nto address the above material weakness that include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing specific\nmanagement review procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial and non-financial data utilized in\nour business; and implementing improved policies, procedures, and control activities over key financial data to ensure\naccuracy and completeness of this data as used in the aforementioned management review procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except for the material weakness and remediation actions\ndescribed above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter\nthat materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n119\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted, modified, or\nterminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of\nRegulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), except as follows:\nOn December 12, 2023, Jason Fannin, the Company’s chief commercial officer, adopted a trading plan intended\nto satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c).
