The amendment extends the term of the facility by three years to November 2027, as well as simplifying and reducing the interest rates, and providing flexibility for Lifecore as it relates to certain covenants and reporting requirements.\n\n“BMO is a highly regarded global provider of corporate banking services and has been a trusted partner to Lifecore for more than 10 years. The willingness of the BMO team to extend and amend our existing revolving credit facility with advantageous terms demonstrates the bank’s confidence in our current business, as well as our ability to execute on our go-forward growth strategy,” said Ryan Lake, chief financial officer of Lifecore. “This ABL amendment is the latest positive strategic financial action executed by Lifecore, following our recent successful raising of $24.3 million in a private placement of Lifecore common stock. Together, these activities have significantly improved our balance sheet and overall financial position, providing a strong foundation for future growth.”\n\nIn recent months, Lifecore has also successfully executed a variety of operational and new business initiatives designed to reshape the company and best position it for continued growth in the rapidly expanding CDMO market. These have included key management team appointments, including CEO and CFO, expansion of manufacturing capabilities and capacity through the installation and qualification of its high-speed, multi-purpose 5-head isolator filler, and the signing of several new customers, highlighted by its high-profile agreement with Lindy Biosciences. **About Lifecore Biomedical**\n\nLifecore Biomedical, Inc.
