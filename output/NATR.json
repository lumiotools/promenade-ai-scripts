(Nasdaq: NATR) (\"Nature’s Sunshine\"), a leading natural health and wellness company offering high-quality herbal and nutritional products, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales were up 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million (up 4% in constant currency).\n  * GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $4.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter delivered the highest sales volume this year, with $114.6 million in sales, up 4% versus prior year on a local currency basis. The strong performance was driven by robust customer growth in Japan and Taiwan, continued progress in Korea, and strong execution and customer activation in Central Europe.” said Terrence Moorehead, CEO of Nature’s Sunshine. “The positive momentum was somewhat offset by the macroeconomic headwinds in China.”\n\n“We are excited about the actions we’ve taken to advance our strategic agenda and remain confident that our approach will allow us to attract and retain more customers, drive profitable growth, and build shareholder value.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n**Net Sales by Operating Segment**(Amounts in Thousands)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2023** |  **Percent****Change** |  **Impact of****Currency****Exchange** |  **Percent****Change****Excluding****Impact of****Currency**  \nAsia | **$** | **55,293** | $ | 52,218 | 5.9 | % | $ | (1,418 | ) | 8.6 | %  \nEurope | **19,615** | 18,769 | 4.5 | 302 | 2.9  \nNorth America | **33,631** | 34,792 | (3.3 | ) | (46 | ) | (3.2 | )  \nLatin America and Other | **6,076** | 5,423 | 12.0 | (136 | ) | 14.5  \n**$** | **114,615** | $ | 111,202 | 3.1 | % | $ | (1,298 | ) | 4.2 | %  \n  \nNet sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nGross profit margin in the third quarter decreased to 71.3% compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by higher inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange which offset our savings initiatives.\n\nVolume incentives as a percentage of net sales were 31.0% compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the timing of promotional incentives and changes in market mix.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") in the third quarter were $41.0 million compared to $41.3 million in the year‐ago quarter. The decrease was primarily related to the streamlining of our global expenses and reduced service fees due to China's lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 35.7% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37.1% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOperating income in the third quarter decreased to $5.3 million, or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $5.8 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOther income, net, in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other income, net, primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains in Asia, partially offset by foreign exchange losses in Latin America, that resulted from net changes in foreign currencies. The provision for income taxes was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million for the year-ago quarter.\n\nGAAP net income attributable to common shareholders increased to $4.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to NSP China decreased to $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned increase in net sales partially offset by the reduction in gross profit margin. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from continuing operations before taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other income (loss) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and certain noted adjustments. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the attached financial tables.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $31.6 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $8.8 million compared to $9.2 million in the comparable period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 509,000 shares at a total cost of $8.4 million or $16.56 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $78.7 million and zero debt.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nNature's Sunshine now expects full year 2024 net sales to range between $443 - $448 million ($436 - $445 million prior) and adjusted EBITDA to range between $40 - $42 million ($39 - $42 million prior).\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third quarter of 2024 results.\n\nDate: Thursday, November 7, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Mountain time) Toll-free dial-in number: 1-800-717-1738 International dial-in number: 1-646-307-1865Conference ID: 03533\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans, strategies and financial results, including expected improvements in gross profit and gross margin. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as “believe,” “hope,” “may,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions, and are based on assumptions and assessments made in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\n  * extensive government regulations to which the Company’s products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject;\n  * registration of products for sale in foreign markets, or difficulty or increased cost of importing products into foreign markets;\n  * legal challenges to the Company’s direct selling program or to the classification of its independent consultants;\n  * laws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in some markets;\n  * liabilities and obligations arising from improper activity by the Company’s independent consultants;\n  * product liability claims;\n  * impact of anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n  * the Company’s ability to attract and retain independent consultants;\n  * the loss of one or more key independent consultants who have a significant sales network;\n  * potential for increased liability and compliance costs relating to the Company’s joint venture for operations in China with Fosun Industrial Co., Ltd.;\n  * the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates;\n  * failure of the Company’s independent consultants to comply with advertising laws;\n  * changes to the Company’s independent consultants' compensation plans;\n  * geopolitical issues and conflicts;\n  * negative consequences resulting from difficult economic conditions, including the availability of liquidity or the willingness of the Company’s customers to purchase products;\n  * risks associated with the manufacturing of the Company’s products;\n  * supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand;\n  * failure to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our independent consultants and customers;\n  * world-wide slowdowns and delays related to supply chain, ingredient shortages and logistical challenges;\n  * uncertainties relating to the application of transfer pricing, duties, value-added taxes, and other tax regulations, and changes thereto;\n  * changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation;\n  * failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting;\n  * cybersecurity threats and exposure to data loss;\n  * the storage, processing, and use of data, some of which contain personal information, are subject to complex and evolving privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n  * reliance on information technology infrastructure; and\n  * the sufficiency of trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\n\n\n\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are more fully detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports filed on Form 10-Q.\n\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in or incorporated by reference into this press release. Except as is required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\n\nWe utilize the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of our operations and believe that these measures are useful indicators of our ability to fund our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\n\nOther companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine Products’ performance in relation to other companies. We have included a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA. We have also included a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted EPS, in the attached financial tables.\n\nNet sales in local currency removes, from net sales in U.S. dollars, the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. This is accomplished by translating the current period's net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period.\n\nWe believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWith respect to our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2024, a quantitative reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP information cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock based compensation.

(Nasdaq: NATR) (\"Nature’s Sunshine\"), a leading natural health and wellness company offering high-quality herbal and nutritional products, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales were up 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million (up 4% in constant currency).\n  * GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $4.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter delivered the highest sales volume this year, with $114.6 million in sales, up 4% versus prior year on a local currency basis. The strong performance was driven by robust customer growth in Japan and Taiwan, continued progress in Korea, and strong execution and customer activation in Central Europe.” said Terrence Moorehead, CEO of Nature’s Sunshine. “The positive momentum was somewhat offset by the macroeconomic headwinds in China.”\n\n“We are excited about the actions we’ve taken to advance our strategic agenda and remain confident that our approach will allow us to attract and retain more customers, drive profitable growth, and build shareholder value.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n**Net Sales by Operating Segment**(Amounts in Thousands)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2023** |  **Percent****Change** |  **Impact of****Currency****Exchange** |  **Percent****Change****Excluding****Impact of****Currency**  \nAsia | **$** | **55,293** | $ | 52,218 | 5.9 | % | $ | (1,418 | ) | 8.6 | %  \nEurope | **19,615** | 18,769 | 4.5 | 302 | 2.9  \nNorth America | **33,631** | 34,792 | (3.3 | ) | (46 | ) | (3.2 | )  \nLatin America and Other | **6,076** | 5,423 | 12.0 | (136 | ) | 14.5  \n**$** | **114,615** | $ | 111,202 | 3.1 | % | $ | (1,298 | ) | 4.2 | %  \n  \nNet sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nGross profit margin in the third quarter decreased to 71.3% compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by higher inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange which offset our savings initiatives.\n\nVolume incentives as a percentage of net sales were 31.0% compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the timing of promotional incentives and changes in market mix.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") in the third quarter were $41.0 million compared to $41.3 million in the year‐ago quarter. The decrease was primarily related to the streamlining of our global expenses and reduced service fees due to China's lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 35.7% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37.1% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOperating income in the third quarter decreased to $5.3 million, or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $5.8 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOther income, net, in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other income, net, primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains in Asia, partially offset by foreign exchange losses in Latin America, that resulted from net changes in foreign currencies. The provision for income taxes was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million for the year-ago quarter.\n\nGAAP net income attributable to common shareholders increased to $4.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to NSP China decreased to $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned increase in net sales partially offset by the reduction in gross profit margin. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from continuing operations before taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other income (loss) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and certain noted adjustments. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the attached financial tables.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $31.6 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $8.8 million compared to $9.2 million in the comparable period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 509,000 shares at a total cost of $8.4 million or $16.56 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $78.7 million and zero debt.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nNature's Sunshine now expects full year 2024 net sales to range between $443 - $448 million ($436 - $445 million prior) and adjusted EBITDA to range between $40 - $42 million ($39 - $42 million prior).\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third quarter of 2024 results.\n\nDate: Thursday, November 7, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Mountain time) Toll-free dial-in number: 1-800-717-1738 International dial-in number: 1-646-307-1865Conference ID: 03533\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

All statements (other than statements of historical fact) that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as “believe,” “hope,” “may,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions, and are based on assumptions and assessments made in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\n  * extensive government regulations to which the Company’s products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject;\n  * registration of products for sale in foreign markets, or difficulty or increased cost of importing products into foreign markets;\n  * legal challenges to the Company’s direct selling program or to the classification of its independent consultants;\n  * laws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in some markets;\n  * liabilities and obligations arising from improper activity by the Company’s independent consultants;\n  * product liability claims;\n  * impact of anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n  * the Company’s ability to attract and retain independent consultants;\n  * the loss of one or more key independent consultants who have a significant sales network;\n  * potential for increased liability and compliance costs relating to the Company’s joint venture for operations in China with Fosun Industrial Co., Ltd.;\n  * the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates;\n  * failure of the Company’s independent consultants to comply with advertising laws;\n  * changes to the Company’s independent consultants' compensation plans;\n  * geopolitical issues and conflicts;\n  * negative consequences resulting from difficult economic conditions, including the availability of liquidity or the willingness of the Company’s customers to purchase products;\n  * risks associated with the manufacturing of the Company’s products;\n  * supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand;\n  * failure to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our independent consultants and customers;\n  * world-wide slowdowns and delays related to supply chain, ingredient shortages and logistical challenges;\n  * uncertainties relating to the application of transfer pricing, duties, value-added taxes, and other tax regulations, and changes thereto;\n  * changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation;\n  * failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting;\n  * cybersecurity threats and exposure to data loss;\n  * the storage, processing, and use of data, some of which contain personal information, are subject to complex and evolving privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n  * reliance on information technology infrastructure; and\n  * the sufficiency of trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\n\n\n\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are more fully detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports filed on Form 10-Q.\n\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in or incorporated by reference into this press release. Except as is required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\n\nWe utilize the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of our operations and believe that these measures are useful indicators of our ability to fund our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\n\nOther companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine Products’ performance in relation to other companies. We have included a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA. We have also included a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted EPS, in the attached financial tables.\n\nNet sales in local currency removes, from net sales in U.S. dollars, the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. This is accomplished by translating the current period's net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period.\n\nWe believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWith respect to our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2024, a quantitative reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP information cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock based compensation. For the same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Investor Relations:**\n\nGateway Group, Inc.Cody Slach1-949-574-3860NATR@gateway-grp.com\n\nNATURE’S SUNSHINE PRODUCTS, INC.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nNature's Sunshine Reports Third Quarter\n2024 Results\nLEHI, Utah, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nature’s Sunshine Products, Inc.\n(Nasdaq: NATR) (\"Nature’s Sunshine\"), a leading natural health and wellness company\noffering high-quality herbal and nutritional products, reported financial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter\nNet sales were up 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million (up 4% in constant\ncurrency).\nGAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $4.3 million, or $0.23 per\ndiluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was up 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million.\nManagement Commentary\n“The third quarter delivered the highest sales volume this year, with $114.6 million in sales,\nup 4% versus prior year on a local currency basis. The strong performance was driven by\nrobust customer growth in Japan and Taiwan, continued progress in Korea, and strong\nexecution and customer activation in Central Europe.” said Terrence Moorehead, CEO of\nNature’s Sunshine. “The positive momentum was somewhat offset by the macroeconomic\nheadwinds in China.”\n“We are excited about the actions we’ve taken to advance our strategic agenda and remain\nconfident that our approach will allow us to attract and retain more customers, drive\nprofitable growth, and build shareholder value.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nNet Sales by Operating Segment(Amounts in Thousands)\nThree Three Percent\nMonths Months Change\nEnded Ended Impact of Excluding\nSeptember September Percent Currency Impact of\n30, 2024 30, 2023 Change Exchange Currency\nAsia $ 55,293 $ 52,218 5.9% $ (1,418) 8.6%\nEurope 19,615 18,769 4.5 302 2.9\nNorth America 33,631 34,792 (3.3) (46) (3.2)\nLatin America and Other 6,076 5,423 12.0 (136) 14.5\n$ 114,615 $ 111,202 3.1% $ (1,298) 4.2%\nNet sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $114.6 million compared to $111.2 million in\nthe same year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, net sales in\nthe third quarter of 2024 increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nGross profit margin in the third quarter decreased to 71.3% compared to 73.1% in the year-\nago quarter. The decrease was driven by higher inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange\nwhich offset our savings initiatives.\nVolume incentives as a percentage of net sales were 31.0% compared to 30.7% in the year-\nago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the timing of promotional incentives and\nchanges in market mix.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") in the third quarter were $41.0 million\ncompared to $41.3 million in the year‐ago quarter. The decrease was primarily related to the\nstreamlining of our global expenses and reduced service fees due to China's lower net\nsales. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 35.7% for the third quarter of\n2024 compared to 37.1% in the year-ago quarter.\nOperating income in the third quarter decreased to $5.3 million, or 4.6% of net sales,\ncompared to $5.8 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in the year-ago quarter.\nOther income, net, in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $0.9\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023. Other income, net, primarily consisted of foreign\nexchange gains in Asia, partially offset by foreign exchange losses in Latin America, that\nresulted from net changes in foreign currencies. The provision for income taxes was $3.3\nmillion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million for the year-ago quarter.\nGAAP net income attributable to common shareholders increased to $4.3 million, or $0.23\nper diluted common share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, in\nthe third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to NSP China decreased to $1.5 million, or\n$0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.6 million, or\n$0.08 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased 5% to $10.7 million compared to $10.3\nmillion in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned\nincrease in net sales partially offset by the reduction in gross profit margin. Adjusted\nEBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from\ncontinuing operations before taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other income (loss)\nadjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and certain noted adjustments. A\nreconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the attached financial tables.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $13.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $31.6 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $8.8 million compared to $9.2\nmillion in the comparable period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the Company repurchased 509,000 shares at a total cost of $8.4 million or $16.56 per\nshare. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $78.7\nmillion and zero debt.\nOutlook\nNature's Sunshine now expects full year 2024 net sales to range between $443 - $448\nmillion ($436 - $445 million prior) and adjusted EBITDA to range between $40 - $42 million\n($39 - $42 million prior).\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third\nquarter of 2024 results.\nDate: Thursday, November 7, 2024\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Mountain time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-800-717-1738\nInternational dial-in number: 1-646-307-1865\nConference ID: 03533\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are\nnot limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans, strategies and financial results,\nincluding expected improvements in gross profit and gross margin. All statements (other\nthan statements of historical fact) that address activities, events or developments that we\nintend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-\nlooking statements. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as\n“believe,” “hope,” “may,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,”\n“project,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions, and are based on assumptions\nand assessments made in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current\nconditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe to be appropriate.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties, including the following:\nextensive government regulations to which the Company’s products, business\npractices and manufacturing activities are subject;\nregistration of products for sale in foreign markets, or difficulty or increased cost of\nimporting products into foreign markets;\nlegal challenges to the Company’s direct selling program or to the classification of its\nindependent consultants;\nlaws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell\nour products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in\nsome markets;\nliabilities and obligations arising from improper activity by the Company’s independent\nconsultants;\nproduct liability claims;\nimpact of anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\nthe Company’s ability to attract and retain independent consultants;\nthe loss of one or more key independent consultants who have a significant sales\nnetwork;\npotential for increased liability and compliance costs relating to the Company’s joint\nventure for operations in China with Fosun Industrial Co., Ltd.;\nthe effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates;\nfailure of the Company’s independent consultants to comply with advertising laws;\nchanges to the Company’s independent consultants' compensation plans;\ngeopolitical issues and conflicts;\nnegative consequences resulting from difficult economic conditions, including the\navailability of liquidity or the willingness of the Company’s customers to purchase\nproducts;\nrisks associated with the manufacturing of the Company’s products;\nsupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to\naccurately forecast customer demand;\nfailure to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers\nand deliver products to our independent consultants and customers;\nworld-wide slowdowns and delays related to supply chain, ingredient shortages and\nlogistical challenges;\nuncertainties relating to the application of transfer pricing, duties, value-added taxes,\nand other tax regulations, and changes thereto;\nchanges in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation;\nfailure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting;\ncybersecurity threats and exposure to data loss;\nthe storage, processing, and use of data, some of which contain personal information,\nare subject to complex and evolving privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\nreliance on information technology infrastructure; and\nthe sufficiency of trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from\npredicted results are more fully detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our reports filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand Quarterly Reports filed on Form 10-Q.\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are\nexpressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in or incorporated\nby reference into this press release. Except as is required by law, the Company expressly\ndisclaims any obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to\nreflect events after the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning non-GAAP net\nincome, adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange\nfluctuations.\nWe utilize the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the\nevaluation of our operations and believe that these measures are useful indicators of our\nability to fund our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered\nas an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator\nof our operating performance.\nOther companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different\nitems, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine\nProducts’ performance in relation to other companies. We have included a reconciliation of\nnet income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA. We have also\nincluded a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP\nadjusted EPS, in the attached financial tables.\nNet sales in local currency removes, from net sales in U.S. dollars, the impact of changes in\nexchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign\nsubsidiaries. This is accomplished by translating the current period's net sales into U.S.\ndollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net\nsales for the previous comparable period.\nWe believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors\nbecause it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from\nperiod to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not\nbe considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that\nreflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and\npresented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWith respect to our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2024, a quantitative\nreconciliation to the corresponding GAAP information cannot be provided without\nunreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the\noccurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such\nreconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably\npredicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock based compensation.
