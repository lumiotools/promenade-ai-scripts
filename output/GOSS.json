To that end, as we come into the home stretch for 2024, our team remains hard at work, diligently focused on completing PROSERA Study enrollment and designing the registrational Phase 3 PH-ILD clinical trial.” \n\n**Seralutinib (GB002): Inhaled PDGFR, CSF1R and c-KIT Inhibitor for PAH and PH-ILD**\n\n  * Enrollment is ongoing in the PROSERA Study, a global registrational Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with WHO Functional Class II and III PAH. The primary endpoint is change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline at week 24. Topline results from the PROSERA Study are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. \n  * In mid-2025, after engaging and discussing with global regulatory authorities, we expect to commence a global registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of seralutinib for the treatment of patients with PH-ILD. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities**: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $327.0 million.
