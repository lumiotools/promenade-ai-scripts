Riley Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: RILY) (\"B. Riley\" or the \"Company\"), a diversified financial services company, today announced it received an additional delinquency notification letter from Nasdaq on November 20, 2024, which indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of the delayed filing of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024.

Riley” or the “Company”), a diversified\nfinancial services platform, today released financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024.\nFirst Quarter 2024 Summary\n• Net loss available to common shareholders of $51 million primarily driven by non-cash, unrealized\ninvestment losses\n• Total revenues of $343 million vs $432 million for the first quarter of 2023\n• Operating revenues(3) of $379 million vs $389 million\n• Operating adjusted EBITDA(4)(5) of $66 million vs $88 million\n• Total cash and cash equivalents of $191 million as of March 31, 2024\n• Total cash and investments(1) of $1.61 billion as of quarter end\n• Retired $115 million of 6.75% 2024 Senior Notes; and repaid $57 million of bank debt facilities and notes\npayable\n• Declared quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share\nBryant Riley, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of B. Riley Financial, commented: “Overall, we had a\nsolid quarter from an operating perspective despite the unusual events our firm has experienced over the last\nseveral months. As we review this quarter, it is worth pointing out a few meaningful changes since last year. Results\nfrom 2023 benefited from $52 million of unrealized gains on investments in addition to increased interest income\nfrom the pool of performing consumer receivables that we acquired in the prior year which is maturing. In contrast,\nthe first quarter of 2024 reflected $30 million of unrealized non-cash investment losses, and incremental costs\nrelated to the filing of our 10-K, internal review and subsequent independent investigation undertaken by our\nBoard’s Audit Committee. Excluding these items, operating income was flat compared to last year based on the\nperformance of our core businesses – B. Riley Securities, Wealth Management, and Financial Consulting, including\nAdvisory Services which reported a record first quarter.”\nTom Kelleher, Co-Chief Executive Officer of B. Riley Financial, added: “As it relates to our operating\nperformance, B. Riley Advisory Services delivered its strongest Q1 results in our firm’s history, driven by increased\ndemand for appraisals and bankruptcy restructuring, litigation consulting and real estate services. B. Riley\nSecurities benefitted from a steady dealmaking environment and generated more in fee income this quarter\ncompared to the same period last year, despite a decrease in overall Capital Markets segment revenues. Wealth\nManagement operating margins have continued to improve over the last two years, and our Communications\nportfolio continued to deliver steady cash flow to our platform during the quarter. While Targus is continuing to work\nthrough macro headwinds, we believe the business is poised to turn as the overall PC market normalizes. Our core\noperating performance remains strong – and that is due in no small part to the continued dedication of our\nemployees across B. Riley.”\nRiley continued: “Consistent with our business model, we have monetized investments since year-end and used\nthe capital to retire bonds, repay $57 million of bank debt and notes payable, and redeploy in attractive new\nopportunities – including Nogin which is a great strategic fit with our brands business. The strategic review process\nfor our Great American Group retail liquidation and appraisal businesses is progressing, and we are pleased with\nthe interest we have seen to date. Throughout all of the distractions we experienced this past quarter, we have kept\nour heads down and focused on running our business in the best interest of our stockholders by addressing the\nneeds of our clients, partners, and employees. To that end, we are pleased to deliver our investors a quarterly\ndividend of $0.50 per share based on our operating performance for the first quarter.”\nwww.brileyfin.com | NASDAQ: RILY 1\nDeclaration of Common Dividend\nThe Company has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share which will be paid on or about June 11,\n2024 to common shareholders of record as of May 27, 2024.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAt March 31, 2024, the Company had $191 million of cash and cash equivalents.

As a result of the changes, the Company has recast the financial data for the\nConsumer Products segment and reporting of the All Other Category for all periods presented.\nThe Company operates in six reportable operating segments: (i) Capital Markets, through which the Company provides investment banking, corporate\nfinance, securities lending, restructuring, research, sales and trading services to corporate and institutional clients; (ii) Wealth Management, through which\nthe Company provides wealth management and tax services to corporate and high-net-worth clients; (iii) Auction and Liquidation, through which the\nCompany provides auction and liquidation services to help clients dispose of assets that include multi-location retail inventory, wholesale inventory, trade\nfixtures, machinery and equipment, intellectual property and real property; (iv) Financial Consulting, through which the Company provides bankruptcy,\nfinancial advisory, forensic accounting, real estate consulting and valuation and appraisal services; (v) Communications, through which the Company\nprovides consumer Internet access and related subscription services, cloud communication services, and mobile phone voice, text, and data services and\ndevices; and (vi) Consumer Products, which generates revenue through sales of laptop and computer accessories.\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n(a) Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of B. Riley Financial, Inc. and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries\nand have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe Company consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest. In addition, the Company performs an analysis to determine\nwhether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”) including ongoing reassessments of\nwhether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. See Note 2(n) for further discussion.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to interim financial reporting guidelines and\nthe rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of the\nCompany’s management, all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position\nand the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 24, 2024. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future periods.\n7\n(b) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and\nexpense during the reporting period. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as valuation of securities, allowance for credit losses, the\nfair value of loans receivables, intangible assets and goodwill, share based arrangements, contingent consideration, accounting for income tax valuation\nallowances, and sales returns and allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes\nare reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.\n(c) Interest Expense — Securities Lending Activities\nInterest expense from securities lending activities is included in operating expenses related to operations in the Capital Markets segment. Interest expense\nfrom securities lending activities is incurred from equity and fixed income securities that are loaned to the Company and totaled $35,383 and $32,424\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(d) Concentration of Risk\nRevenues in the Capital Markets, Financial Consulting, Wealth Management, and Communications segments are primarily generated in the United States.\nRevenues in the Auction and Liquidation segment and Consumer Products segment are primarily generated in the United States, Australia, Canada, and\nEurope.\nThe Company maintains cash in various federally insured banking institutions. The account balances at each institution periodically exceed the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC\ninsurance coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company also has substantial cash balances from proceeds\nreceived from auctions and liquidation engagements that are distributed to parties in accordance with the collaborative arrangements.\nThe Company’s activities in the Auction and Liquidation segment are executed frequently with, and on behalf of, distressed customers and secured\ncreditors. Concentrations of credit risk can be affected by changes in economic, industry, or geographical factors. The Company seeks to control its credit\nrisk and potential risk concentration through risk management activities that limit the Company’s exposure to losses on any one specific liquidation\nservices contract or concentration within any one specific industry. To mitigate the exposure to losses on any one specific liquidations services contract, the\nCompany sometimes conducts operations with third parties through collaborative arrangements.\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company loaned $108,000 to Conn’s Inc. (“Conn’s”) as more fully described in Note 19. On February 14, 2024, the Company\ncollected $15,000 of principal payments which reduced the loan balance to $93,000. This loan combined with two other existing loans receivable with an\noutstanding balance of $58,350 and $62,808 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is collateralized by consumer loan receivables of\ncustomers of the furniture and electronics retailer. These loans have an aggregate fair value of $147,630 and $167,568 or 32.6% and 31.5% of the loan\nportfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are concentrated in the retail industry. In the event there is a recession or\neconomic downturn that would put pressure on the retailer’s customers, this could impact the operations of the retailer and payment patterns of the\ncustomers and the overall performance and collectability of these loans.\nThe Company also has a loan receivable with a principal amount of $200,506 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The loan receivable allows for\ninterest to be paid-in-kind, which is capitalized to the loan receivable balance annually on the loan's anniversary date. The interest receivable on the loan\nwas $14,971 and $8,889 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. The loan receivable is secured by a first priority security interest in Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC (“Freedom VCM”) equity\ninterests owned by Brian Kahn as more fully described in Note 2(h) below. The fair value of the loan receivable was $183,268 and $200,506 or 40.5% and\n37.7% of the total loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deterioration in the collateral, including in the performance of\nFreedom VCM or delays in the execution of its strategies, including the possible disposition of additional businesses and further de-leveraging of its\nbalance sheet, for the loan receivable may impact the ultimate collection of principal and interest.\n8\nThe maximum amount of loss that the Company is exposed to is equivalent to the fair value of these loans which totaled $330,898 and $368,074 as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(e) Advertising Expenses\nThe Company expenses advertising costs, which consist primarily of costs for printed materials, as incurred. Advertising costs totaled $2,410 and $2,937\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising expense was included as a component of selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\n(g) Restricted Cash\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash included $1,889 and $1,875, respectively, primarily consisting of cash collateral for leases.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of the following:\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 190,690 $ 231,964\nRestricted cash 1,889 1,875\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 192,579 $ 233,839\n(h) Loans Receivable\nUnder ASC 825 - Financial Instruments, the Company elected the fair value option for all outstanding loans receivable. Management evaluates the\nperformance of the loan portfolio on a fair value basis. Under the fair value option, loans receivables are measured at each reporting period based upon\ntheir exit value in an orderly transaction and unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\nLoans receivable, at fair value totaled $452,496 and $532,419 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The loans have various\nmaturities through August 2033. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the historical cost of loans receivable accounted for under the fair value\noption was $494,730 and $555,882, respectively, which included principal balances of $499,956 and $563,637 respectively, and unamortized costs,\norigination fees, premiums and discounts, totaling $5,226 and $7,755, respectively. The principal balance of loans receivable exceeded the fair value of\nloans by $42,234 and $23,463 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At the time of origination, the Company's loans are\ncollateralized by the assets of borrowers and other pledged collateral and may have guarantees to provide for protection of the payments due on loans\nreceivable. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded net unrealized losses of $18,771 and net unrealized gains of\n$43,459, respectively, on loans receivable, at fair value, which is included in trading income (loss) and fair value adjustments on loans on the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Loans receivable, at fair value on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was approximately zero as of\nMarch 31, 2024. Loans receivable, at fair value on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was $41,236, which represents approximately 7.7% of total\nloans receivable, at fair value as of December 31, 2023. The principal balance of loans receivable on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was\n$43,326 as of December 31, 2023. Interest income for loans on non-accrual and/or 90 days or greater past due is recognized separately from changes in fair\nvalue in interest income - loans and securities lending on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amount of gains or (losses) included in\nearnings attributable to changes in instrument – specific credit risk was $(11,339) and $37,488 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The gains or losses attributable to changes in instrument – specific risk was determined by management based on an estimate of the fair value\nchange during the period specific to each loan receivable.\n9\nThe Company may periodically provide limited guarantees to third parties for loans that are made to investment banking and lending clients. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, the Company has outstanding limited guarantee arrangements with respect to Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (“B&W”) as further\ndescribed in Note 16(b). In accordance with the credit loss standard, the Company evaluates the need to record an allowance for credit losses for these loan\nguarantees since they have off-balance sheet credit exposures. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has not recorded any provision for credit losses on the\nB&W guarantees since the Company believes that there is sufficient collateral to protect the Company from any credit loss exposure.\nInterest income on loans receivable is recognized based on the stated interest rate of the loan on the unpaid principal balance plus the amortization of any\ncosts, origination fees, premiums and discounts and is included in interest income - loans and securities lending on the condensed consolidated statements\nof operations. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the\nrelated loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.\nOn August 21, 2023, one of the Company’s subsidiaries and Vintage Capital Management, LLC (“VCM”), an affiliate of Brian Kahn, amended and\nrestated a promissory note (the “Amended and Restated Note”), pursuant to which VCM owes the Company's subsidiary the aggregate principal amount of\n$200,506 and bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum payable-in-kind with a maturity date of December 31, 2027. The Amended and Restated Note\nrequires repayments prior to the maturity date from certain proceeds received by VCM, Mr. Kahn or his affiliates from, among other proceeds, distributions\nor dividends paid by Freedom VCM in amount equal to the greater of (i) 80% of the net after-tax proceeds, and (ii) 50% of gross proceeds. The obligations\nunder the Amended and Restated Note are primarily secured by a first priority perfected security interest in Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr.\nKahn, the CEO and a board member of Freedom VCM as of December 31, 2023, and his spouse with a value (based on the transaction price in the FRG\ntake-private transaction) of $227,296 as of August 21, 2023. On January 22, 2024, Mr. Kahn resigned as CEO and a member of the board of directors of\nFreedom VCM. The fair value of the Freedom VCM equity interest owned by Mr. Kahn and his spouse was $197,782 and $232,065 as of March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. Amounts owing under the Amended and Restated Note may be repaid at any time without penalty. On a quarterly\nbasis, the Company will continue to obtain third party appraisals to evaluate the value of the collateral of the loan since the repayment of the loan and\naccrued interest will be paid primarily from the cash distributions from Freedom VCM or foreclosure on the underlying collateral. In light of Mr. Kahn’s\nalleged involvement with the alleged misconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be\nsubject to claims asserting an interest in the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and\nRestated Note. If a claim were successful, it would diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are\nmade, however, the Company believes it has valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Other factors leading to a\ndeterioration in the collateral, including in the performance of Freedom VCM or delays in the execution of its strategies, including the possible disposition\nof additional businesses and further de-leveraging of its balance sheet, for the loan receivable may impact the ultimate collection of principal and interest.\nIn the event the loan balance and accrued interest exceed the underlying collateral value of the loan, this will impact the fair value of the loan and result in\nan unrealized loss being recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable is recognized based on the stated interest rate of the loan on the unpaid principal balance plus the amortization of any\ncosts, origination fees, premiums and discounts and is included in interest income - loans and securities lending on the consolidated statements of\noperations. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the\nrelated loans. Unearned income, discounts, and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.\nAs of March 31, 2024, loans receivable had an aggregate remaining contractual principal balance of $499,956, an aggregate fair value of $452,496, and the\ncontractual principal balance exceeded the fair value by $47,460. As of December 31, 2023, loans receivable had an aggregate remaining contractual\nprincipal balance of $563,637, an aggregate fair value of $532,419, and the contractual principal balance exceeded the fair value by $31,218.\nBadcock Loan Receivable\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“Badcock Receivables I”) with W.S. Badcock Corporation,\na Florida corporation (“WSBC”), which at the time was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Franchise Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FRG”),\nwhich became a subsidiary of Freedom VCM as a result of the transaction on August 21, 2023. The Company paid $400,000 in cash to WSBC for the\npurchase of certain consumer credit receivables of WSBC. On September 23, 2022, the Company's then majority-owned subsidiary, B Riley\n10\nReceivables II, LLC (“BRRII”), a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“Badcock Receivables II”)\nwith WSBC. This purchase of $168,363 consumer credit receivables of WSBC was partially financed by a $148,200 term loan discussed in Note 10.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, BRRII entered into Amendment No. 2 and No. 3 to Badcock Receivables II with WSBC for a total of\n$145,278 in additional consumer credit receivables. The accounting for these transactions resulted in the Company recording a loan receivable from WSBC\nwith the recognition of interest income at an imputed rate based on the cash flows expected to be received from the collection of the consumer receivables\nthat serve as collateral for the loan. These loan receivables are measured at fair value.\nOn August 21, 2023, all of the equity interests of BRRII were sold to Freedom VCM Receivables, Inc. (“Freedom VCM Receivables”), a subsidiary of\nFreedom VCM, which resulted in a loss of $78. In connection with the sale, Freedom VCM Receivables assumed the obligations with respect to the\nPathlight Credit Agreement as more fully discussed in Note 10 and Freedom VCM Receivables entered into a non-recourse promissory note with another\nFreedom VCM affiliate in the amount of $58,872, with a stated interest rate of 19.74% and a maturity date of August 21, 2033 with payments of principal\nand interest on the note limited solely to the performance of certain consumer receivables held by BRRII. This loan receivable is measured at fair value.\nIn connection with these loans, the Company entered into a Servicing Agreement with WSBC pursuant to which WSBC provides to the Company certain\ncustomary servicing and account management services in respect of the receivables purchased by the Company under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition, subject to certain terms and conditions, FRG has agreed to guarantee the performance by WSBC of its obligations under the Master\nReceivables Purchase Agreements and the Servicing Agreement.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Badcock Receivables I loan receivable to WSBC in the Company's condensed consolidated balance\nsheets included loans measured at fair value in the amount of $15,868 and $20,624, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nFreedom VCM Receivables’ loan receivable in connection with the sale of all of the equity interests of BRRII was included in the Company's condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets in loans receivable, at fair value in the amount of $42,482 and $42,183, respectively.\nNogin Loan and Loan Commitment\nOn November 16, 2023, the Company entered into a Chapter 11 Restructuring Support Agreement (as amended, the “RSA”) with Nogin Inc. and certain of\nits subsidiaries (collectively, “Nogin”), and certain holders of Nogin’s convertible notes (the “Consenting Noteholders”). Pursuant to the RSA, the\nCompany funded $17,530 of debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing as of December 31, 2023. The Company funded an additional $15,470 during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024, which increased the DIP financing to $33,000 at March 31, 2024. This loan receivable had a fair value of $32,673 and\n$17,980 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An additional $3,000 of DIP financing was funded in the second quarter of 2024, for a\ntotal DIP financing (inclusive of $1,700 in fees payable in kind) of $37,700. On May 3, 2024, the Company funded an additional $21,300 in cash to\ncomplete the acquisition of Nogin of which $15,500 was a payment to the Consenting Noteholders.\n(i) Securities and Other Investments Owned and Securities Sold Not Yet Purchased\nSecurities owned consist of equity securities including, common and preferred stocks, warrants, and options; corporate bonds; other fixed income securities\nincluding, government and agency bonds; loans receivable valued at fair value; and investments in partnerships. Securities sold, but not yet purchased\nrepresent obligations of the Company to deliver the specified security at the contracted price and thereby create a liability to purchase the security in the\nmarket at prevailing prices. Changes in the value of these securities are reflected currently in the results of operations.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s securities and other investments owned and securities sold not yet purchased at fair value\nconsisted of the following securities:\n11\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSecurities and other investments owned:\nEquity securities $ 869,137 $ 994,634\nCorporate bonds 56,616 59,287\nOther fixed income securities 5,151 2,989\nPartnership interests and other 18,964 35,196\n$ 949,868 $ 1,092,106\nSecurities sold not yet purchased:\nEquity securities $ 2,609 $ 1,037\nCorporate bonds 2,592 5,971\nOther fixed income securities 1,222 1,593\n$ 6,423 $ 8,601\nThe Company owns certain equity securities that are accounted for under the fair value option where the Company would otherwise use the equity method\nof accounting. Investments become subject to the equity method of accounting when the Company possesses the ability to exercise significant influence,\nbut not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the Company\npossesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. However, the Company may have the ability to exercise significant influence over the\ninvestee when the Company owns less than 20% of the voting interests of the investee depending on the facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the\nability to exercise influence is present, such as when the Company has representation on the board of directors of such investee.\nThe Brand Investments\nThe following tables contain summarized financial information with respect to five of the Company's investments in limited liability companies that\nprimarily license brand names and trademarks through licensing agreements. The Company has an ownership interest in each investee between 10% and\n50%. For the 10% ownership interest, the Company is presumed to have the ability to exercise significant influence since the investment is more than\nminor and the limited liability company is required to maintain specific ownership accounts for each member. The Company has significant influence in the\nother four investments due to the ownership interest being greater than 20%. The financial information of these five investments has been aggregated and\nincluded below for purposes of the disclosure a quarter in arrears (balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 correspond to\namounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of the Company; income statement amounts during the three months ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022 correspond to amounts during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of the Company), which is the period in\nwhich the most recent financial information is available:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2023\nCurrent assets $ 47,356 $ 51,588\nNoncurrent assets $ 266,995 $ 269,809\nCurrent liabilities $ 9,524 $ 8,594\nNoncurrent liabilities $ 621 $ 760\nEquity attributable to investee $ 301,380 $ 309,167\nNoncontrolling interest $ 2,826 $ 2,876\n12\nFor the three months ended December 31,\n2023(1) 2022\nRevenues $ 33,966 $ 27,971\nCost of revenues $ 19,069 $ 16,387\nNet income attributable to investees $ 15,152 $ 11,808\n(1) - Financial information for 2023 includes two additional investments as a result of the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in bebe stores, inc\n(“bebe”) in 2023 and an other investment made in 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of these five investments totaled $288,436 and $283,057, respectively, and are included in\nsecurities and other investments owned, at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nFreedom VCM Holdings, LLC Equity Interest and Take-Private Transaction\nOn August 21, 2023, the Company acquired an equity interest in Freedom VCM for $216,500 in cash in connection with the closing of the acquisition of\nFRG, by a buyer group that included members of senior management of FRG, led by Mr. Kahn, FRG’s then Chief Executive Officer (the “FRG take-\nprivate transaction”). In connection with the closing of the FRG take-private transaction, the Company terminated an investment advisory agreement (the\n“Advisory Agreement”) with Mr. Kahn. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, Mr. Kahn, as financial advisor, had the sole power to vote or dispose of\n$64,644 of shares of FRG common stock (based on the value of FRG shares in the FRG take-private transaction as of the closing date of such transaction)\nheld of record by B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“BRS”). Upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement, (i) Mr. Kahn’s right to vote or dispose of such FRG\nshares terminated, (ii) such FRG shares owned by BRS were rolled over into additional equity interests in Freedom VCM in connection with the FRG take-\nprivate transaction, and (iii) Mr. Kahn owed a total of $20,911 to the Company under the Advisory Agreement which amount was added to, and included\nin, the Amended and Restated Note.\nFollowing these transactions, the Company owns an equity interest of $281,144 or 31% of the outstanding equity interests in Freedom VCM. Also in\nconnection with the FRG take-private transaction, on August 21, 2023 all of the equity interests of BRRII, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company,\nwere sold to a Freedom VCM affiliate, which resulted in a loss of $78. In connection with the sale, the Freedom VCM affiliate assumed the obligations\nwith respect to the Pathlight Credit Agreement, as further discussed in Note 10, and the Company entered into a non-recourse promissory note with another\nFreedom VCM affiliate in the amount of $58,872, with a stated interest rate of 19.74% and a maturity date of August 21, 2033 (the “Freedom Receivables\nNote”) with payments of principal and interest on the note limited solely to performance of certain receivables held by BRRII.\nThe Company has elected to account for this 31% equity investment under the fair value option. The following tables contain summarized financial\ninformation with respect to Freedom VCM, included below for purposes of the disclosure a quarter in arrears (balance sheet amounts as of December 31,\n2023 and September 30, 2023 correspond to amounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of the Company; income statement\namounts during the three months ended December 31, 2023 correspond to amounts during the three months ended March 31, 2024 of the Company), which\nis the period in which the most recent financial information is available:\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 961,787 $ 1,219,682\nNoncurrent assets $ 3,131,506 $ 3,142,660\nCurrent liabilities $ 720,510 $ 749,894\nNoncurrent liabilities $ 2,640,805 $ 2,695,445\nEquity attributable to investee $ 731,978 $ 917,003\n13\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\nRevenues $ 806,229\nCost of revenues $ 499,679\nLoss from continuing operations $ (1,175)\nNet loss attributable to investees $ (169,583)\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investment in Freedom VCM totaled $244,638 and $287,043, respectively, and is\nincluded in securities and other investments owned, at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the\nprincipal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. In general, fair values determined by Level\n1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments that are highly liquid, observable, and actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Fair\nvalues determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that\nare not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable and can be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs\nthat are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In certain cases, the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The\nCompany’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific\nto the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s securities and other investments owned and securities sold and not yet purchased are comprised of common and preferred stocks and\nwarrants, corporate bonds, and investments in partnerships. Investments in common stocks that are based on quoted prices in active markets are included in\nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company also holds loans receivable valued at fair value, nonpublic common and preferred stocks and warrants for\nwhich there is little or no public market and fair value is determined by management on a consistent basis. For investments where little or no public market\nexists, management’s determination of fair value is based on the best available information which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and\ninvolves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration various factors including earnings history, financial condition, recent sales prices of the\nissuer’s securities and liquidity risks. These investments are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Investments in partnership interests include\ninvestments in private equity partnerships that primarily invest in equity securities, bonds, and direct lending funds. The Company also invests in priority\ninvestment funds and the underlying securities held by these funds are primarily corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities and restrictions exist\non the redemption of amounts invested by the Company. The Company’s partnership and investment fund interests are valued based on the Company’s\nproportionate share of the net assets of the partnerships and funds; the value for these investments is derived from the most recent statements received\n16\nfrom the general partner or fund administrator. These partnership and investment fund interests are valued at net asset value (“NAV”) and are excluded\nfrom the fair value hierarchy in the table below in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\npartnership and investment fund interests valued at NAV of $18,964 and $35,196, respectively, are included in securities and other investments owned in\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities and other investments owned also include investments in nonpublic entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not report\nNAV per share. These investments are accounted for using a measurement alternative under which they are measured at cost and adjusted for observable\nprice changes and impairments. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the\nreporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. For these transactions to be\nconsidered observable price changes of the same issuer, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights,\ndistribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold. The following table presents, as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying value of equity securities measured under the measurement alternative investments and the related adjustments recorded\nduring the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes:\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSecurities and other investments owned, carrying value $ 68,135 $ 64,455\nUpward carrying value changes 928 100\nDownward carrying value changes/impairment (2) (21,395)\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments when they are deemed to be\nother-than-temporarily impaired, investments adjusted to their fair value by applying the measurement alternative, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in\nan acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held\nfor sale or determined to be impaired. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nin periods subsequent to initial recognition as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n17\nThe following tables present information on the financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a\nRecurring Basis as of March 31, 2024 Using\nQuoted prices in\nactive markets Other observable Significant\nFair value as of for identical asset s inputs unobservable inputs\nMarch 31, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2 ) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nSecurities and other investments owned:\nEquity securities $ 801,002 $ 126,323 $ — $ 674,679\nCorporate bonds 56,616 51,566 5,050 —\nOther fixed income securities 5,151 — 5,151 —\nTotal securities and other investments owned 862,769 177,889 10,201 674,679\nLoans receivable, at fair value 452,496 — — 452,496\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 1,315,265 $ 177,889 $ 10,201 $ 1,127,175\nLiabilities:\nSecurities sold not yet purchased:\nEquity securities $ 2,609 $ 2,609 $ — $ —\nCorporate bonds 2,592 36 2,556 —\nOther fixed income securities 1,222 — 1,222 —\nTotal securities sold not yet purchased 6,423 2,645 3,778 —\nMandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests issued after\nNovember 5, 2003 5,601 — — 5,601\nContingent consideration 29,322 — — 29,322\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 41,346 $ 2,645 $ 3,778 $ 34,923\n18\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a\nRecurring Basis at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted prices in\nactive markets Other observable Significant\nFair value at for identical asset s inputs unobservable inputs\nDecember 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2 ) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nSecurities and other investments owned:\nEquity securities $ 930,179 $ 194,541 $ — $ 735,638\nCorporate bonds 59,287 56,045 3,242 —\nOther fixed income securities 2,989 — 2,989 —\nTotal securities and other investments owned 992,455 250,586 6,231 735,638\nLoans receivable, at fair value 532,419 — — 532,419\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 1,524,874 $ 250,586 $ 6,231 $ 1,268,057\nLiabilities:\nSecurities sold not yet purchased:\nEquity securities $ 1,037 $ 1,037 $ — $ —\nCorporate bonds 5,971 — 5,971 —\nOther fixed income securities 1,593 — 1,593 —\nTotal securities sold not yet purchased 8,601 1,037 7,564 —\nMandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests issued after\nNovember 5, 2003 5,835 — — 5,835\nContingent consideration 27,985 — — 27,985\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 42,421 $ 1,037 $ 7,564 $ 33,820\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial assets measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis and classified within Level 3 were\n$1,127,175 and $1,268,057, respectively, or 22.6% and 20.9%, respectively, of the Company’s total assets.

The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements for\ncash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value based on\nthe short-term maturity of these instruments.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the senior notes payable had a carrying amount of $1,553,616 and $1,668,021, respectively, and fair value\nof $1,038,272 and $1,127,503, respectively. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company's notes payable, revolving credit facility, and term loans of\n$632,784 and $688,343 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximates fair value because the effective yield of such instrument\nis consistent with current market rates of interest for instruments of comparable credit risk.\nThe investments in nonpublic entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes\nrecognized in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These investments are\nevaluated on a nonrecurring basis based on the observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nFurther adjustments are not made until another observable transaction occurs. Therefore, the determination of fair values of these investments in nonpublic\nentities that do not report NAV does not involve significant estimates and assumptions or subjective and complex judgments. Investments in nonpublic\nentities that do not report NAV are subject to a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company is\nrequired to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment charge in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in\nexcess of its estimated fair value.\n22\nThe following table presents information on the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In countries where the functional currency of the underlying operations has been determined\nto be the local country’s currency, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using average\nexchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates.\nThe effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains were $2,268 and losses were $234 during the three months ended March 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. These amounts were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements\nof operations.\n(l) Equity Method Investment\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an equity investment that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting had a carrying value of\n$2,046 and $2,087, respectively, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The\nCompany’s share of earnings or losses from equity method investees included in income (loss) from equity investments was $(4) and $(10) during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nbebe stores, inc.\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company owned a 41.3% ownership interest in bebe. This was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the\nCompany had no income from this equity investment during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On October 6, 2023, the Company purchased an\nadditional 3,700,000 shares of bebe for an aggregate purchase price of $18,500, resulting in an increase in the Company's ownership interest to 76.2%. The\npurchase of these additional shares resulted in the Company having a majority voting interest in bebe and the consolidation of bebe financial results for\nperiods subsequent to October 6, 2023.\n(m) Supplemental Non-cash Disclosures\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, there was non-cash investing activity related to the receipt of a note receivable in the amount of $2,000\nrelated to the sale of certain assets and $42,077 related to a loan receivable, at fair value that converted into equity securities. During the three months\nended March 31, 2023, non-cash investing activities included $15,000 of notes receivable that converted into equity securities; $1,190 of loans receivable,\nat fair value, that was included in consideration paid for the purchase of the Lingo noncontrolling interest; and $2,111 of common stock issued as part of the\npurchase price consideration for a business acquisition. During the three months ended months ended March 31, 2023, non-cash financing activities also\nincluded $7,000 in seller financing related to the purchase of the Lingo noncontrolling interest.\n23\n(n) Variable Interest Entities\nThe Company holds interests in various entities that meet the characteristics of a VIE but are not consolidated as the Company is not the primary\nbeneficiary. Interests in these entities are generally in the form of equity interests, loans receivable, or fee arrangements.\nThe Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a VIE and reconsiders that conclusion at each\nreporting date. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either\ndirectly by the Company or indirectly through related parties.\nThe party with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Company determines whether it\nis the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: (a) which variable interest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; (b) which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE; (c) the VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE\nwas designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders; (d) the terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and (e) related-party relationships with other parties that may also have a variable interest in the VIE.\nOn August 21, 2023, in connection with the FRG take-private transaction, one of the Company's subsidiaries (the “Lender”) and an affiliate of Mr. Kahn\n(the “Borrower”) entered into an amended and restated a promissory note as discussed further in Note 2(h) and 2(i) above. The Company was not involved\nin the design of the Borrower, has no equity financial interest, and has no rights to make decisions or participate in the management of the Borrower that\nsignificantly impact the economics of the Borrower. Since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the Borrower, the Company is\nnot the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate the Borrower. The promissory note is included in loans receivable, at fair value in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and is a variable interest in accordance with the accounting guidance. As of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the maximum amount of loss exposure to the VIE was $215,477 and $209,395, respectively.\nThe Company, has entered into agreements to provide investment banking and advisory services to numerous investment funds (the “Funds”) that are\nconsidered variable interest entities under the accounting guidance.\nThe Company earns fees from the Funds in the form of placement agent fees and carried interest. For placement agent fees, the Company receives a cash\nfee of generally 7% to 10% of the amount of raised capital for the Funds and the fee is recognized at the time the placement services occurred. The\nCompany receives carried interest as a percentage allocation (8% to 15%) of the profits of the Funds as compensation for asset management services\nprovided to the Funds and it is recognized under the ownership model of ASC 323 - Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures as an equity method\ninvestment with changes in allocation recorded currently in the results of operations. As the fee arrangements under such agreements are arm’s length and\ncontain customary terms and conditions and represent compensation that is considered fair value for the services provided, the fee arrangements are not\nconsidered variable interests and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate such VIEs.\nPlacement agent fees attributable to such arrangements were $372 and zero during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\nwere included in services and fees in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe carrying amounts included in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets related to variable interests in VIEs that were not consolidated is\nshown below.\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSecurities and other investments owned, at fair value $ 14,538 $ 28,573\nLoans receivable, at fair value 247,115 250,801\nOther assets 17,594 11,418\nMaximum exposure to loss $ 279,247 $ 290,792\n24\nB. Riley Principal 250 Merger Corporation (“BRPM”)\nIn 2021, the Company along with BRPM 250, a newly formed special purpose acquisition company incorporated as a Delaware corporation, consummated\nthe initial public offering of 17,250,000 units of BRPM 250. Each Unit of BRPM 250 consisted of one share of class A common stock and one-third of one\nredeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of BRPM 250 class A common stock at an exercise price of\n$11.50 per share. The BRPM 250 Units were each sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to BRPM 250 of $172,500. These proceeds\nwere deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the BRPM 250 class A public shareholders and was included in prepaid expenses and other\nassets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These proceeds are invested only in U.S. treasury securities in accordance with the governing\ndocuments of BRPM 250. Under the terms of the BRPM 250 initial public offering, BRPM 250 was required to consummate a business combination\ntransaction within 24 months (or 27 months under certain circumstances) of the completion of its initial public offering.\nIn connection with the completion of the initial public offering of BRPM 250, the Company invested in the private placement units of BRPM 250. BRPM\n250 was determined to be a VIE because it did not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The\nCompany had determined that the class A shareholders of BRPM 250 do not have substantive rights as shareholders of BRPM 250 since these equity\ninterests are determined to be temporary equity. As such, the Company had determined that it is the primary beneficiary of BRPM 250 as it has the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impact BRPM 250’s economic\nperformance. Since the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, BRPM 250 was consolidated into the Company’s financial statements.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Board of Directors of BRPM 250 approved a plan to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of BRPM 250,\neffective as of May 4, 2023. The BRPM 250 Class A public shares were deemed cancelled on May 4, 2023, and the funds held in trust were used to fund\nthe corresponding redemption amounts to the BRPM 250 Class A shareholders and BRPM 250 was no longer a VIE.\n(o) Recent Accounting Standards\nNot yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures. The amendments in this update improve income tax disclosure requirements related to the transparency of rate reconciliation and income\ntaxes paid disclosures and the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit). The\namendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied\non a prospective basis. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its financial\nposition and results of operations.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this update improve reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories included in each reported measure\nof a segment's profit or loss on an interim and annual basis. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied retrospectively\nto all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the effect this new\nstandard will have on its financial position and results of operations.\nNOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS\n2024 Acquisitions\nOn May 3, 2024, one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries completed the acquisition of Nogin for a total purchase consideration of approximately\n$59,000, which consisted of $37,700 in DIP financing (see Note 2(h)) and an additional $21,300 in cash consideration. To fund the $21,300 in cash\nconsideration, contemporaneous with the closing, the acquired company issued $15,000 of convertible debt. The impact of the consolidation of Nogin’s\nfinancial statements is not expected to be material to the Company’s financial position or operating results. Since the controlling interest was acquired\nsubsequent to quarter end, the Company believes the disclosure of pro forma financial information is impracticable because the financial information and\nvaluation reports needed to account for the acquisition and prepare unaudited pro forma financial information has not been made available to the Company\nas of the reporting date.\n25\n2023 Acquisitions\nFreedom VCM Equity Investment Acquisition - Pro Forma Financial Information\nOn August 21, 2023, the Company acquired approximately 31% equity interest in Freedom VCM for total consideration of $281,144.

The pro-forma financial information presented includes the effects of the common stock\noffering in July 2023 and adjustments related to additional interest expense from borrowings that the Company used to finance the acquisition of the equity\ninterest.

Riley Financial, Inc. $ (49,165) $ 17,155\nPreferred stock dividends (2,015) (2,012)\nNet (loss) income available to common shareholders $ (51,180) $ 15,143\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic 29,989,584 28,585,337\nEffect of dilutive potential common shares:\nRestricted stock units and warrants — 928,098\nDiluted 29,989,584 29,513,435\nBasic (loss) income per common share $ (1.71) $ 0.53\nDiluted (loss) income per common share $ (1.71) $ 0.51\n40\nNOTE 16 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n(a) Legal Matters\nThe Company is subject to certain legal and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, the Company and its subsidiaries are\nnamed in and subject to various proceedings and claims arising primarily from the Company’s securities business activities, including lawsuits, arbitration\nclaims, class actions, and regulatory matters. Some of these claims seek substantial compensatory, punitive, or indeterminate damages. The Company and\nits subsidiaries are also involved in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations regarding the\nCompany’s business, which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, and other relief. In addition to such legal and other\nclaims, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of unasserted claims, including, among others, as\nit relates to matters related to Mr. Kahn and our investment in Freedom VCM. For example, in light of Mr. Kahn’s alleged involvement with the alleged\nmisconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be subject to claims asserting an interest\nin the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and Restated Note. If a claim were successful, it\nwould diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are made, however, the Company believes it\nhas valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Notwithstanding the uncertainties described in this paragraph, the\nCompany does not believe that the results of these asserted or unasserted claims are likely to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nOn May 2, 2024, a putative class action was filed by Ted Donaldson in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of\nall persons who acquired the Company’s senior notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 dated January 28, 2021,\nand the prospectuses filed and published on August 4, 2021 and December 2, 2021 (the “Note Offerings”). The action asserts claims under §§ 11, 12, and\n15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against the Company, certain of the Company's officers and directors, and the underwriters of the Note\nOfferings. The complaint alleges that defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including an alleged\nconspiracy to commit fraud. The Company believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend this action.\nOn January 24, 2024, a putative securities class action complaint was filed by Mike Coan in U.S. Federal District Court, Central District of California,\nagainst the Company, Bryant Riley, Tom Kelleher and Phillip Ahn (“Defendants”). The purported class includes persons and entities that purchased shares\nof the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges that (a) the Company failed to disclose to investors\nthat (i) Brian Kahn, had been implicated in a conspiracy to defraud third party investors, and (ii) the Company financed Brian Kahn and others in\nconnection with a going private transaction involving FRG, and (b) as a result of the foregoing, the Company engaged in securities fraud in violation of\nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A second putative class action lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2024 by the KL Kamholz\nJoint Revocable Trust (“Kamholz”). This complaint asserts similar allegations as the Coan complaint and covers an alleged class period between February\n28, 2022 and November 9, 2023. The Kamholz complaint further alleges that Defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in\nillegal activities, including a conspiracy to commit fraud, and nonetheless proceeded with the FRG going-private transaction. The Company cannot\nestimate the amount of potential liability, if any, that could arise from these matters and believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend these\nactions.\nOn September 21, 2023, the Company received a demand alleging that certain payments in the aggregate amount of approximately $32,166 made by\nSorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sorrento”), a chapter 11 debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas, to B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC\n(“BRCC”), pursuant to that certain Bridge Loan Agreement dated September 30, 2022 between Sorrento and BRCC, are avoidable as preferential transfers.\nThe Company believes the Sorrento Unsecured Creditors Committee’s preference claims lack merit, and the Company intends to assert its statutory\ndefenses to defeat the claim.\n(b) Babcock & Wilcox Commitments and Guarantees\nOn January 18, 2024, the Company entered into a guaranty (the “Axos Guaranty”) in favor of (i) Axos Bank, in its capacity as administrative agent (the\n“Administrative Agent”) for the secured parties under that certain credit agreement, dated as of January 18, 2024, among Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises,\nInc.

The Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty is enforceable in certain\ncircumstances, including, among others, certain events of default and the acceleration of B&W’s obligations under a reimbursement agreement with respect\nto such cash collateral. B&W will pay the Company $935 per annum in connection with the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty. B&W has agreed to\nreimburse the Company to the extent the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty is called upon. As of December 31, 2023, the Cash Collateral Provider\nGuaranty was in respect of up to $90,000 of B&W obligations after B&W made paydowns of $10,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty was in respect of up to $67,500 of B&W obligations after B&W made paydowns of $22,500 during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Company entered into a general agreement of indemnity in favor of one of B&W’s sureties. Pursuant to this indemnity\nagreement, the Company agreed to indemnify the surety in connection with a default by B&W under a €30,000 payment and performance bond issued by\nthe surety in connection with a construction project undertaken by B&W. In consideration for providing the indemnity, B&W paid the Company fees in the\namount of $1,694 on January 20, 2022.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company entered into a project specific indemnity rider to a general agreement of indemnity made by B&W in favor of one of its\nsureties. Pursuant to the indemnity rider, the Company agreed to indemnify the surety in connection with a default by B&W under the underlying\nindemnity agreement relating to a $29,970 payment and performance bond issued by the surety in connection with a construction project undertaken by\nB&W. In consideration for providing the indemnity rider, B&W paid the Company fees in the amount of $600 on August 26, 2020. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the indemnity rider was reduced to $5,994.\n(c) FRG Commitments\nOn May 10, 2023, the Company entered into certain agreements pursuant to which the Company had, among other things, agreed to provide certain equity\nfunding and other support in connection with the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Freedom VCM, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent”), of FRG.\nThe Company entered into an Equity Commitment Letter with Freedom VCM (“TopCo”), the parent company of the Parent, and the Parent, pursuant to\nwhich the Company agreed to provide to TopCo, at or prior to the closing of the Acquisition, an amount equal to up to $560,000 in equity financing. The\nCompany and FRG also entered into a Limited Guarantee in favor of FRG, pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee to FRG the due and\npunctual payment, performance and discharge when required by Parent or its subsidiary to FRG of certain liabilities and obligations of the Parent or such\nsubsidiary.

These commitments\nrequire the Company to purchase securities at a specified price or otherwise provide debt or equity financing on specified terms. Securities underwriting\nexposes the Company to market and credit risk, primarily in the event that, for any reason, securities purchased by the Company cannot be distributed at\nthe anticipated price and to balance sheet risk in the event that debt or equity financing commitments cannot be syndicated. With respect to one of the\nCompany’s investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an agreement whereby the subsidiary may be required, commencing in\nAugust 2027 and expiring in August 2028, to purchase additional equity capital at fair value which was originally valued at $15,000.\n42\nNOTE 17 — SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n(a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans\nUnder the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units under the Company’s 2021 Plan was\n$8,374 and $13,312 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

These reportable segments are all distinct\nbusinesses, each with a different marketing strategy and management structure. During the fourth quarter of 2023, management reassessed the Company's\npreviously reported Consumer segment due to organizational changes and financial information provided to the CODM. These changes resulted in Targus’\noperations being reported on a stand alone basis in the Consumer Products segment and the operations related to brand licensing that was previously\nreported in the Consumer segment being reported in the All Other Category that is reported with Corporate and Other.\nAs a result of the changes discussed above in the Consumer segment, the Company has recast the financial data for the Consumer Products segment and\nreporting of the All Other Category for all periods presented. The following is a summary of certain financial data for each of the Company’s reportable\nsegments:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nCapital Markets segment:\nRevenues - Services and fees $ 60,347 $ 57,929\nTrading (loss) income and fair value adjustments on loans (30,468) 50,296\nInterest income - Loans and securities lending 59,944 77,186\nTotal revenues 89,823 185,411\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (53,224) (65,711)\nInterest expense - Securities lending and loan participations sold (35,383) (32,424)\nDepreciation and amortization (771) (1,256)\nSegment income 445 86,020\nWealth Management segment:\nRevenues - Services and fees 51,182 48,542\nTrading income and fair value adjustments on loans 600 1,272\nTotal revenues 51,782 49,814\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (49,048) (47,322)\nRestructuring charge — (33)\nDepreciation and amortization (1,055) (1,086)\nSegment income 1,679 1,373\nAuction and Liquidation segment:\nRevenues - Services and fees 3,560 5,444\nRevenues - Sale of goods 2,220 216\nTotal revenues 5,780 5,660\nDirect cost of services (1,456) (3,128)\nCost of goods sold (788) (52)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (1,508) (2,280)\nSegment income 2,028 200\nFinancial Consulting segment:\nRevenues - Services and fees 35,085 25,010\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (28,860) (21,149)\n47\nDepreciation and amortization (85) (78)\nSegment income 6,140 3,783\nCommunications segment:\nRevenues - Services and fees 81,070 85,052\nRevenues - Sale of goods 1,296 1,867\nTotal revenues 82,366 86,919\nDirect cost of services (48,819) (44,733)\nCost of goods sold (1,359) (2,168)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (17,918) (22,544)\nRestructuring charge (263) (60)\nDepreciation and amortization (5,957) (6,631)\nSegment income 8,050 10,783\nConsumer Products segment:\nRevenues - Sale of goods 51,522 65,694\nCost of goods sold (36,880) (45,406)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (15,525) (19,294)\nDepreciation and amortization (1,997) (2,608)\nRestructuring charge (526) —\nSegment loss (3,406) (1,614)\nConsolidated operating income from reportable segments 14,936 100,545\nAll Other:\nRevenues - Services and fees 26,059 13,582\nRevenues - Sale of goods 615 —\nTotal revenues 26,674 13,582\nDirect cost of services (10,851) (6,536)\nCost of goods sold (588) —\nCorporate and other expenses (33,600) (22,668)\nInterest income 669 2,574\nDividend income 11,815 13,204\nRealized and unrealized losses on investments (29,545) (28,442)\nChange in fair value of financial instruments and other 314 (209)\nLoss on equity investments (4) (10)\nInterest expense (44,864) (47,561)\n(Loss) income before income taxes (65,044) 24,479\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes 17,090 (7,919)\nNet (loss) income (47,954) 16,560\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 1,211 (595)\nNet (loss) income attributable to B.

Riley,” “B. Riley Financial,” “we,” “us” or “our”\nrefer to the combined business of B. Riley Financial, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nDescription of the Company\nB. Riley Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq: RILY) (the “Company”) is a diversified financial services platform that delivers tailored solutions to meet the strategic,\noperational, and capital needs of its clients and partners. We operate through several consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “B. Riley”) that provide\ninvestment banking, brokerage, wealth management, asset management, direct lending, business advisory, valuation, and asset disposition services to a\nbroad client base spanning public and private companies, financial sponsors, investors, financial institutions, legal and professional services firms, and\nindividuals.\n50\nThe Company opportunistically invests in and acquires companies or assets with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles to benefit our shareholders. We own\nand operate several uncorrelated consumer businesses and invest in brands on a principal basis. Our approach is focused on high quality companies and\nassets in industries in which we have extensive knowledge and can benefit from our experience to make operational improvements and maximize free cash\nflow. Our principal investments often leverage the financial, restructuring, and operational expertise of our professionals who work collaboratively across\ndisciplines.\nWe refer to B. Riley as a “platform” because of the unique composition of our business. Our platform has grown considerably and become more diversified\nover the past several years. We have increased our market share and expanded the depth and breadth of our businesses both organically and through\nopportunistic acquisitions. Our increasingly diversified platform enables us to invest opportunistically and to deliver strong long-term investment\nperformance throughout a range of economic cycles.\nWe are headquartered in Los Angeles, California and maintain offices throughout the U.S. including in New York, Chicago, Metro District of Columbia,\nAtlanta, Boston, Dallas, Metro Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Miami, San Francisco, Boca Raton, and West Palm Beach, as well as additional offices located\nin Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nWe report our activities in six reportable business segments: Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Financial Consulting, Auction and Liquidation,\nCommunications, and Consumer Products segment. These reportable segments are all distinct businesses, each with a different marketing strategy and\nmanagement structure. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we reassessed our previously reported Consumer segment due to organizational changes and\nfinancial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). These changes resulted in Targus’ operations being reported on a stand-\nalone basis in the Consumer Products segment and the operations related to brand licensing that was previously reported in the Consumer segment being\nreported in the All Other Category that is reported with Corporate and Other.\nRecent Developments\nGreat American Group Strategic Alternatives Review. On February 29, 2024, we announced that we had retained Moelis & Company LLC as an\nindependent financial advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives for our Appraisal and Valuation Services, and Retail, Wholesale & Industrial\nSolutions businesses (collectively formerly known as “Great American Group”), which could include a potential sale or other transaction. If a potential\ntransaction were to be consummated, we anticipate that proceeds may be used in a variety of ways including de-levering our balance sheet, repurchasing\nshares and bonds in the open market, and investing in the platform and in particular, B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“BRS”). Moelis & Company LLC and the\nCompany have started the strategic review process and began a solicitation of interest process in April 2024. There can be no assurances that we will\ncomplete, or as to the terms of, any such potential transaction.\nAudit Committee Review/Investigation. As previously disclosed, after we learned from news reports in November 2023 that Brian Kahn, the then Chief\nExecutive Officer of Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC (“Freedom VCM”) and the Franchise Group, Inc. (“FRG”), was identified as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in SEC allegations and criminal charges of securities fraud against an executive of an unrelated hedge fund, the Audit Committee of the Board\nretained Sullivan & Cromwell LLP to conduct a thorough, internal review of the transactions among Mr. Kahn (and his affiliates) and the Company (and its\naffiliates). The review confirmed what we previously disclosed: that the Company and its executives, including Bryant Riley, had no involvement with, or\nknowledge of, any of the alleged misconduct concerning Brian Kahn or any of his affiliates. On February 22, 2024, our Board of Directors issued a\nstatement regarding its review of the circumstances associated with our participation in the management-led buyout of FRG and related matters.\nSubsequently, the Audit Committee engaged Winston & Strawn LLP as separate, independent counsel to assist the Audit Committee in conducting an\ninvestigation of these same matters and related allegations. As separately disclosed by us on the date of this Annual Report, following receipt of the results\nof the Audit Committee's independent investigation as assisted by Winston & Strawn LLP, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reconfirmed\nthat the Company and its executives, including Bryant R. Riley, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, had no involvement with, or knowledge of, any\nof the alleged misconduct concerning Brian Kahn or any of his affiliates.\nOur diversified financial platform is affected by a variety of factors including continuing higher inflation, the actions by the Federal Reserve to address\ninflation, the possibility of recession or an economic downturn, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and rising energy prices.\nThese factors create uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and may impact our business in future periods.\nThese developments and the impact on the financial markets and the overall economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If\n51\nthe financial markets and/or the overall economy continue to be impacted, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially\nadversely affected.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities,\nand reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other\nfactors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates represent the areas where\nmore significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical\naccounting estimates, which include fair value measurements, goodwill and other intangible assets, and accounting for income tax valuation allowances can\nbe found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nThe following period to period comparisons of our financial results and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Dollars in thousands)\n52\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change\n2024 2023 Amount %\nRevenues:\nServices and fees $ 257,303 $ 235,559 $ 21,744 9.2 %\nTrading (loss) income and fair value adjustments on loans (29,868) 51,568 (81,436) (157.9)%\nInterest income - Loans and securities lending 59,944 77,186 (17,242) (22.3)%\nSale of goods 55,653 67,777 (12,124) (17.9)%\nTotal revenues 343,032 432,090 (89,058) (20.6)%\nOperating expenses:\nDirect cost of services 61,126 54,397 6,729 12.4 %\nCost of goods sold 39,615 47,626 (8,011) (16.8)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 209,548 212,627 (3,079) (1.4)%\nRestructuring charge 789 93 696 n/m\nInterest expense - Securities lending and loan participations\nsold 35,383 32,424 2,959 9.1 %\nTotal operating expenses 346,461 347,167 (706) (0.2)%\nOperating (loss) income (3,429) 84,923 (88,352) (104.0)%\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income 669 2,574 (1,905) (74.0)%\nDividend income 11,815 13,204 (1,389) (10.5)%\nRealized and unrealized losses on investments (29,545) (28,442) (1,103) 3.9 %\nChange in fair value of financial instruments and other 314 (209) 523 n/m\nLoss from equity investments (4) (10) 6 (60.0)%\nInterest expense (44,864) (47,561) 2,697 (5.7)%\n(Loss) income before income taxes (65,044) 24,479 (89,523) n/m\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes 17,090 (7,919) 25,009 n/m\nNet (loss) income (47,954) 16,560 (64,514) n/m\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,211 (595) 1,806 n/m\nNet (loss) income attributable to B.

The decrease in revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of the\nportfolio of securities and other investments owned and fair value adjustments on loans of $81.4 million, interest income from loans and securities lending\nof $17.2 million, and sale of goods of $12.1 million, partially offset by an increase in revenues from services and fees of $21.7 million. The increase in\nrevenue from services and fees in the three months ended March 31, 2024 consisted of increases in revenue of $12.5 million in All Other, $10.1 million in\nthe Financial Consulting segment, $2.6 million in the Wealth Management segment, and $2.4 million in the Capital Markets segment, partially offset by\ndecreases in revenue of $4.0 million in the Communications segment, and $1.9 million in the Auction and Liquidation segment.\nRevenues from services and fees in the Capital Markets segment increased $2.4 million to $60.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024\nfrom $57.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increases of $11.0 million of corporate\nfinance, consulting, and investment banking fees, $0.5 million of other income, and $0.4 in asset management fees, partially offset by decreases of $6.5\nmillion in dividends and $3.0 million of commission fees.\n54\nRevenues from services and fees in the Wealth Management segment increased $2.6 million to $51.2 million during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 from $48.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $2.7\nmillion from wealth and asset management fees.\nRevenues from services and fees in the Auction and Liquidation segment decreased $1.9 million to $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 from $5.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in\ncommission fees, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in service contract revenues. The decrease in commission fees was related to a decrease in\nthe size of fee engagements.\nRevenues from services and fees in the Financial Consulting segment increased $10.1 million to $35.1 million during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 from $25.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase of $8.5 million within\nour Advisory Services division primarily consisting of $2.9 million due to a full quarter of revenues from acquisitions in the prior year and $5.6 million in\nadvisory services. The remaining increase in revenues was due to an increase of $1.6 million in Appraisal due to an increase in the number of appraisals\nperformed.\nRevenues from services and fees in the Communications segment decreased $4.0 million to $81.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024\nfrom $85.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases in subscription revenue of\n$3.3 million and $0.7 million in advertising, licensing and other revenue. We expect UOL, magicJack, and Marconi subscription revenue to continue to\ndecline year over year.\nRevenues from services and fees in All Other increased $12.5 million to $26.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $13.6 million\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023. These revenues include the licensing of brand trademarks, merchandise rental fees and sales from bebe\nstores, inc.

The note purchase agreements had a repurchase date of June 30, 2023 on which date we repurchased our 6.75% 2024 Notes with an\naggregate principal amount of $58.9 million.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. In countries where the functional currency of the underlying operations has been determined to be the\nlocal country’s currency, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using average exchange\nrates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates. The\neffects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk consists of risk related to changes in interest rates. We utilize borrowings under our senior notes payable and credit\nfacilities to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions and\n65\noperations. Borrowings under our senior notes payable are at fixed interest rates and borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate of\ninterest. In our portfolio of securities owned, we invest in loans receivable that primarily bear interest at a floating rate of interest. If floating rates of\ninterest had increased by 1% during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the rate increase would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of\n$1.7 million.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the\nincome that we receive from investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investments allow us to maintain a portfolio\nof cash equivalents, short-term investments through a variety of securities owned that primarily includes common stocks, loans receivable, and investments\nin partnership interests. Our cash and cash equivalents through March 31, 2024 included amounts in bank checking and liquid money market accounts. We\nmay be exposed to interest rate risk through trading activities in convertible and fixed income securities as well as U.S. Treasury securities, however, based\non our daily monitoring of this risk, we believe we currently have limited exposure to interest rate risk in these activities.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe majority of our operating activities are conducted in U.S. dollars. Revenues generated from our foreign subsidiaries totaled $37.4 million and $30.5\nmillion during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or 10.9% and 7.0% of our total revenues of $343.0 million and $432.1\nmillion. The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, with the exception of revenues, costs, and\nexpenses, which are translated at average rates during the reporting period. We include gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in\nincome, while we exclude those resulting from translation of financial statements from income and include them as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains (losses), which were included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, amounted to a gain\nof $2.3 million and loss of $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We may be exposed to foreign currency risk;\nhowever, our operating results during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, included $37.4 million and $30.5 million of revenues, respectively,\nand $7.8 million and $8.4 million of operating expenses from our foreign subsidiaries, respectively, and a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S.\ndollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million change in our operating income during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted\nan evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Co-\nChief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at\nthe reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as set forth below under “Material Weakness and Remediation,” there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting\nduring the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\nMaterial Weakness and Remediation\nThe Company previously identified in its 2023 Annual Report the following material weaknesses:\n• The Company identified two separate material weaknesses in controls related to information technology general controls (ITGCs) at our Lingo\nManagement, LLC and Tiger US Holdings, Inc. subsidiaries in the areas of user access,\n66\nprogram change management, and information technology (IT) operations over IT systems and the reports generated from these systems used in the\nexecution of controls that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. As a result, business-process automated and manual controls that were\ndependent on the affected ITGCs could have been adversely impacted.\n• The Company identified a separate material weakness relating to ITGC issues in one of our B. Riley Advisory Holdings, LLC subsidiaries\nprimarily related to ineffective controls over user access management over a certain business application. As a result, business-process automated and\nmanual controls that were dependent on the affected ITGCs could have been adversely impacted.\n• The Company was unable to rely on a System and Organization Controls (“SOC”) 1 Type 2 report associated with the utilization of a third-party\nservice organization's hosted IT solution for the processing of customer sales and billing information in our Marconi Wireless subsidiary. As a result,\nthe internal control processes performed by the third-party service organization were not designed or implemented to operate at a sufficient level of\nprecision. As such, the Company could not rely on the information produced by the system. Business-process automated and manual controls that were\ndependent on these controls could have been adversely impacted.\n• The Company identified a material weakness relating to the operating effectiveness of management's review controls over investment valuations\nsuch that management's review procedures were not operating at a level of precision sufficient to prevent or detect a potential material misstatement in\nthe consolidated statements.\n• The Company did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and disclose material related party transactions in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 850, Related Party Disclosures, which resulted in a material weakness.\nManagement continues to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses noted above are\nremediated, such that the controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the enhancement of control\nactivity evidence, improvement of the precision level of management review controls, and enhancement to policies and procedures, and, as to the material\nweakness related to Marconi Wireless, we continue to work with our third-party service organization supporting Marconi Wireless to provide a compliant\nSOC 1 Type 2 report in 2024.\nWhile we continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the\napplicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. We expect that\nthe remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2024.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well- designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of\nfuture events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of\nany evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n67\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is subject to certain legal and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, the Company and its subsidiaries are\nnamed in and subject to various proceedings and claims arising primarily from the Company’s securities business activities, including lawsuits, arbitration\nclaims, class actions, and regulatory matters. Some of these claims seek substantial compensatory, punitive, or indeterminate damages. The Company and\nits subsidiaries are also involved in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations regarding the\nCompany’s business, which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, and other relief. In addition to such legal and other\nclaims, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of unasserted claims, including, among others, as\nit relates to matters related to Mr. Kahn and our investment in Freedom VCM. For example, in light of Mr. Kahn’s alleged involvement with the alleged\nmisconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be subject to claims asserting an interest\nin the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and Restated Note. If a claim were successful, it\nwould diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are made, however, the Company believes it\nhas valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Notwithstanding the uncertainties described in this paragraph, the\nCompany does not believe that the results of these asserted or unasserted claims are likely to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nOn May 2, 2024, a putative class action was filed by Ted Donaldson in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of\nall persons who acquired the Company’s senior notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 dated January 28, 2021,\nand the prospectuses filed and published on August 4, 2021 and December 2, 2021 (the “Note Offerings”). The action asserts claims under §§ 11, 12, and\n15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against the Company, certain of the Company's officers and directors, and the underwriters of the Note\nOfferings. The complaint alleges that defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including an alleged\nconspiracy to commit fraud. The Company believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend this action.\nOn January 24, 2024, a putative securities class action complaint was filed by Mike Coan in U.S. Federal District Court, Central District of California,\nagainst the Company, Bryant Riley, Tom Kelleher and Phillip Ahn (“Defendants”). The purported class includes persons and entities that purchased shares\nof the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges that (a) the Company failed to disclose to investors\nthat (i) Brian Kahn, had been implicated in a conspiracy to defraud third party investors, and (ii) the Company financed Brian Kahn and others in\nconnection with a going private transaction involving FRG, and (b) as a result of the foregoing, the Company engaged in securities fraud in violation of\nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A second putative class action lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2024 by the KL Kamholz\nJoint Revocable Trust (“Kamholz”). This complaint asserts similar allegations as the Coan complaint and covers an alleged class period between February\n28, 2022 and November 9, 2023. The Kamholz complaint further alleges that Defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in\nillegal activities, including a conspiracy to commit fraud, and nonetheless proceeded with the FRG going-private transaction. The Company cannot\nestimate the amount of potential liability, if any, that could arise from these matters and believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend these\nactions.\nOn September 21, 2023, the Company received a demand alleging that certain payments in the aggregate amount of approximately $32,166 made by\nSorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sorrento”), a chapter 11 debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas, to B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC\n(“BRCC”), pursuant to that certain Bridge Loan Agreement dated September 30, 2022 between Sorrento and BRCC, are avoidable as preferential transfers.\nThe Company believes the Sorrento Unsecured Creditors Committee’s preference claims lack merit, and the Company intends to assert its statutory\ndefenses to defeat the claim.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A detailed discussion\nof our risk factors was included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, 2024. These risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in\nconnection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results and the\nactual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made.\n68\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made the following purchases of our equity securities that are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of\nthe Exchange Act.\nApproximate Dollar\nTotal Number of Shares Value of Shares that\nAverage Price Purchased as Part of May Yet Be Purchased\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased(1) Paid Per Publicly Announced Under the Plans or\nPeriod (2) Share Plans or Programs(2) Program\nJanuary 1 through January 31, 2024 7,120 $ 22.08 — $ 34,206\nFebruary 1 through February 29, 2024 1,551 $ 16.00 — $ 34,206\nMarch 1 through March 31, 2024 56,148 $ 17.54 — $ 34,206\nTotal 64,819 $ 18.00 —\n______________________________\n(1) Includes purchases of 64,819 shares made to satisfy the income tax withholding obligations of certain employees upon the vesting and delivery of\nrestricted stock units issued under our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan.\n(2) Includes purchases of zero shares under the Company's annual share repurchase programs. In November 2023, the share repurchase program was\nreauthorized by the Board of Directors for share repurchases up to $50,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares and the reauthorized program\nexpires in October 2024.\nItem 3.

Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a\ncopy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate\nLoans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition\nof “Base Rate”), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to\nsuch day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or\nconversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts\nrequired pursuant to Section 2.20.\nSection II.16 Inability to Determine Interest Rate.

Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion\nto or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be\ndeemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Loan of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and\n(ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest\nPeriod. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional\namounts required pursuant to Section 2.20. Subject to Section 2.06, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be\nconclusive and binding absent manifest error) that “Adjusted Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any\ngiven day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the\ndefinition of “Base Rate” until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.\nSection II.17 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.\n(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise,\nshall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. All payments by the\nBorrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at\nthe Payment Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein.\nAny payment made by the Borrower hereunder that is received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any\nBusiness Day shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to\naccrue. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders by wire transfer promptly upon receipt in like funds as\nreceived. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the SOFR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,\nsuch payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees,\nas the case may be. If any payment on a SOFR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall\nbe extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar\nmonth, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment\nof principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.\n(b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written\nnotice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of such borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such\nLender’s share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in\naccordance with Section 2.02 or Section 2.05, as applicable, and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a\ncorresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative\nAgent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such\ncorresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such\n70\namount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to\nbe made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance\nwith banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate\napplicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an\noverlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such\nperiod. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such\nLender’s Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have\nagainst a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.\n(c) Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have\nreceived written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the\nLenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such\npayment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the\namount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees\nto repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from\nand including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the\nFederal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation.\n(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans and\nto make payments pursuant to Section 9.05(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such\nparticipation or to make any payment under Section 9.05(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its\ncorresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to\npurchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.05(c).\n(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular\nplace or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular\nplace or manner.\n(f) Insufficient Funds. Except in the case of any funds to be applied pursuant to Section 7.03, if at any time insufficient funds\nare received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such\nfunds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in\naccordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal then due hereunder,\nratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.\n71\nSection II.18 Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy.\n(a) If any Change in Law shall:\n(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar\nrequirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;\n(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its Loans, Loan\nprincipal, Commitments or other Obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or\n(iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans\nmade by such Lender;\nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing\nor maintaining any Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of\nprincipal, interest or any other amount) then, upon the request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will promptly pay to such\nLender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the\ncase may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.\n(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such\nLender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on\nsuch Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of\nsuch Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company\nwith respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or\namounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.\n(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company,\nas the case may be, as specified in Section 2.18(a) or Section 2.18(b) and delivered to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative\nAgent), shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate\nwithin 10 days after receipt thereof.\n(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall not constitute a waiver\nof such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to\nthis Section 2.18 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than twelve months prior to the date that such Lender, as the\ncase may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s intention to\nclaim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the\ntwelve-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).\n72\n(e) The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the\npayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.\nSection II.19 Taxes.\n(a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.19, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.\n(b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan\nDocument shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as\ndetermined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such\npayment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall\ntimely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax\nis an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or\nwithholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19) the\napplicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.\n(c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in\naccordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.\n(d) Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10\ndays after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or\nattributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.19) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a\npayment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes\nwere correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or\nliability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or Agent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its\nown behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Agent, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.\n(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after\ndemand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any\nTaxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant\nRegister and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were\ncorrectly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability\ndelivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the\nAdministrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise\npayable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this\nSection 2.19(e).\n73\n(f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority\npursuant to this Section 2.19, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by\nsuch Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment\nreasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.\n(g) Status of Lenders.\n(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made\nunder any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of\nwithholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other\ndocumentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and\nsubmission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.19(g)(ii)(A), Section 2.19(g)(ii)(B) and\nSection 2.19(g)(ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission\nwould subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial\nposition of such Lender.\n(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,\n(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to\nthe date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the\nreasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such\nLender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;\n(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the\nAdministrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such\nForeign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:\n(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United\nStates is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document,\nexecuted copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal\nwithholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;\n74\n(1) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI or W-8EXP;\n(2) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under\nSection 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign\nLender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10-percent shareholder” of the\nBorrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in\nSection 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E;

The\nLenders and any transferees or assignees after the Closing Date will be required to provide to the Administrative Agent or its agents all\ninformation, documentation or certifications reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to permit the Administrative Agent to comply\nwith its tax reporting obligations under applicable laws, including any applicable cost basis reporting obligations.\n(i) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a\nrefund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.19 (including by the payment of additional amounts\npursuant to this Section 2.19), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity\npayments made under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including\nTaxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to\nsuch refund).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\nin this Section 2.19(i) in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section\n2.19(i) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would\nhave been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and\nthe indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 2.19(i) shall not be construed\nto require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to\nthe indemnifying party or any other Person.\n(j) The Borrower shall provide to Administrative Agent, upon reasonable request, an applicable IRS Tax Form W-9 indicating\nits “US person” tax status and any other Tax form or other documentation that will avoid or minimize any withholding Tax upon receipt of\npayments of upon a foreclosure sale or other disposition of, or otherwise with respect to, any Portfolio Assets, or other Collateral.

Each voluntary prepayment by the Borrower of a Class of Term Loans shall\nbe applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Term Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts\nthen due and owing to the Term Lenders of such Class. Each mandatory prepayment by the Borrower of the Term Loans shall be applied pro\nrata in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the outstanding Term Loans of all Classes then held by the Term Lenders (unless\na given Class of Term Loans has elected to receive a lesser allocation). Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower in\nrespect of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the\noutstanding Revolving Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders.\n(c) The application of any payment of Loans under any Credit Facility shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans under such\nCredit Facility and, second, to SOFR Loans under such Credit Facility.

Any payments,\nprepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to\n78\npay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such\nDefaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.\n(iii) Certain Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which\nthat Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been\nrequired to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).\n(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a\nDefaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and\nsubject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the\nother Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by\nthe Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Credit Facility, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting\nLender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the\nBorrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected\nparties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising\nfrom that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.\nSection II.23 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.\n(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office.

The Borrower hereby\nagrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.\n(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.18, or if the Borrower is required to pay any\nIndemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section\n2.19 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.23(a), or if\nany Lender is a Defaulting Lender and failed to cure the circumstances as a result of which it has become a Defaulting Lender within five\nBusiness Days after the Borrower’s request that it cure such circumstances or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole\nexpense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse\n(in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.06), all of its interests, rights (other than\nits existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.18 or Section 2.19) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan\nDocuments to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such\nassignment); provided that any Non-Consenting Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the assignment and delegation of its interests,\nrights and obligations if it does not execute and deliver an\n79\nAssignment and Assumption to the Administrative Agent within one Business Day after having received a request therefor; provided,\nfurther, that:\n(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.06;\n(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued\ninterest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any\namounts under Section 2.09(c) and Section 2.20) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest\nand fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);\n(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.18 or payments required\nto be made pursuant to Section 2.19, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;\n(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and\n(v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee\nshall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.\nA Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or\notherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.\n(c) Termination of Defaulting Lenders. The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of any Revolving\nLender that is a Defaulting Lender upon not less than five Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly\nnotify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.22(a)(ii) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower\nfor the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts);\nprovided that (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or\nrelease of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.\nArticle III.\nREPRESENTATIONS AND W ARRANTIES\nTo induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and the Lenders to make the Loans, each of Ultimate Parent and\nthe Borrower hereby jointly and severally represents and warrants to each Agent and each Lender on the Closing Date and upon each Credit\nExtension thereafter that:\nSection III.1 Existence, Qualification and Power.

Neither any Group Member nor the conduct of the respective businesses of\nsuch Group Member infringes, misappropriates, dilutes or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property of any third party. No proceedings have\nbeen instituted or are pending against any Group Member or, to the knowledge of the Ultimate Parent, are threatened, alleging any such\ninfringement. Each Group Member has taken commercially reasonable actions to protect the confidentiality of all trade secrets used in such\nGroup Member’s business.\n(c) No third party is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned by any of the\nGroup Members.\n(d) No Impairment.

No Group Member has knowledge (or could reasonably have\nknowledge upon due inquiry) of any proposed or pending tax assessments, deficiencies, audits or other proceedings and no proposed or\npending tax assessments, deficiencies, audits or other proceedings have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the\naggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No Group Member has ever “participated” in a “reportable transaction” within the meaning of Treasury\nRegulation Section 1.6011-4. No Group Member is party to any tax sharing or similar agreement. No transaction, stamp, capital, issuance,\nregistration, transfer, withholding or other Taxes are required to be paid by Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with any\ntransfer of Portfolio Assets, or other Collateral to Administrative Agent or such Lender exercising its rights with respect thereto under the\nLoan Documents (including a foreclosure sale or other disposition).\n83\nSection III.11 No Material Misstatements.\n(a) On the Closing Date, all reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished in writing (other than\nforward-looking information, budgets, estimates and information of a general economic or industry-specific nature) by or on behalf of the\nUltimate Parent or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the\nnegotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by other information\nso furnished), when taken as a whole, do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make\nthe statements therein when taken as a whole, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading.\n(b) The forward-looking information, budgets, estimates and information of a general economic or industry-specific nature that\nhave been furnished to the Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date, when taken as a whole, have been prepared in good faith based\nupon assumptions believed by the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made and at the time furnished (it being recognized that such\ninformation is not to be viewed as facts and that no assurance can be given that any particular financial projections will be realized, that\nactual results may differ significantly from projected results and that such projections are not a guarantee of performance).\nSection III.12 Labor Matters.\n(a) There are no strikes, lockouts, stoppages or slowdowns or other labor disputes affecting any Group Member pending or, to\nthe knowledge of the Loan Parties, threatened in writing that have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the\naggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.\n(b) All payments due from any Group Member, or for which any claim may be made against any Group Member, on account of\nwages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of such Group\nMember except to the extent that the failure to do so has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.\n(c) The hours worked by and payments made to employees of any Group Member have not been in violation of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938, as amended.\nSection III.13 ERISA. Each Plan and, with respect to each Plan, each Group Member and their respective ERISA Affiliates are in\ncompliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. Each Plan which is intended to qualify under\nSection 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS indicating that such Plan is so qualified and nothing\nhas occurred subsequent to the issuance of such determination letter which would cause such Plan to lose its qualified status. No liability to\nthe PBGC (other than required premium payments), the IRS, any Plan (other than in the ordinary course) or any trust established under\nTitle IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any Group Member or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates with respect to\nany Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, individually or together with any other ERISA Events, has\nhad or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefit obligations under each Single\nEmployer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Single Employer Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the\ndate on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Single Employer Plan allocable to such\naccrued benefit obligations by a material amount. As of the most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan, the potential liability of\nthe Group Members and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such\n84\nMultiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 or Section 4205 of ERISA), when aggregated with such potential liability for a\ncomplete withdrawal from all Multiemployer Plans, is zero. The Group Members and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates have\ncomplied with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in material “default” (as\ndefined in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan. No Group Member or any of their respective\nERISA Affiliates contributes to, or has any liability with respect to, any Multiemployer Plan or has any contingent liability with respect to\nany post-retirement welfare benefit under a Plan that is subject to ERISA, other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of\nTitle I of ERISA.

At the time of delivery of any Clear Period Notice (as defined in the Guaranty\nand Collateral Agreement) with respect to any Public Equity, no Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof shall be in possession of any Material\nNonpublic Information with respect to such Public Equity or the Issuer thereof.\nSection III.18 Solvency.

For the avoidance\nof doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain\navailable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the\nAdministrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,

or Secured Party under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment\nReturn Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).\n(d) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any\nObligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and

Erroneous Payment.\n(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and\nhereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim\nor counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including waiver of any defense based on\n“discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.\n(f) Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 8.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the\nAdministrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or\nthe repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.\n134\nSection VIII.12Certain ERISA Matters.\n(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the\nevent that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable\nRequirements of Law without compliance with the provisions of this clause (vii), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed\nto be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.\n(2) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.06(c), from and after the\neffective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of\nthe interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the\nassigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations\nunder this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under\nthis Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18, Section 2.19\nand Section 9.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the\nextent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any\nclaim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a\ncopy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the\nCommitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to\ntime (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and\nthe Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all\npurposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by (x) the Borrower and (y) any Lender solely with respect to any\nentry relating to such Lender’s Loans, in each case, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.\n(d) Participations.

The\nBorrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18, Section 2.19 and Section 2.20 (subject to the\nrequirements and limitations therein, including the requirements in Section 2.19(g) (it being understood that the documentation required\nunder Section 2.19(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by\nassignment pursuant to Section 9.06(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.23 as if it were\nan assignee under Section 9.06(b); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.18 or Section 2.19 with\nrespect to any participation than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at\nthe Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.23(a)\nwith respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.07(b) as\nthough it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 9.07(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that\nsells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the\nname and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other\nobligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any\nportion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any\ncommitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such\ndisclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of\n146\ncredit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b)of the United States Treasury\nRegulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest\nerror, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all\npurposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity\nas Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this\nAgreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other\ncentral bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its\nobligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n(f) Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting\nLender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender\nto the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender\nwould otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a\ncommitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of\nsuch Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC\nhereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.\nEach party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all\nliability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement\nshall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding\ncommercial paper or other indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any\nbankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States of America or any state\nthereof.

Any prepayment of any Class of Loan pursuant\nto Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c) and Section 2.10(e) shall be applied as specified by the Borrower in the applicable notice of prepayment;\nprovided that any payment of Revolving Loans shall be made on a pro rata basis as among the various Classes thereof (in accordance with\nthe respective outstanding principal amounts thereof); provided, further, in the event the Borrower fails to specify the Class of Loans to\nwhich any such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied as follows:\nfirst, to repay outstanding Revolving Loans on a pro rata basis as among the various Classes thereof (in accordance with the\nrespective outstanding principal amounts thereof) to the full extent thereof; and\nsecond, to prepay the Term Loans on a pro rata basis as among the various Classes thereof (in accordance with the respective\noutstanding principal amounts thereof), applied to each such Class to reduce the scheduled remaining installments of principal in\ndirect order of maturity.\n(b) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. Any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.10(b), 2.10(g) or 2.10(h)\nshall be applied as follows:\nfirst, ratably in accordance with the principal amount thereof to (i) prepay the Term Loans on a pro rata basis as among the\nvarious Classes thereof (in accordance with the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof), applied to each such Class to\nreduce the scheduled remaining installments of principal in direct order of maturity and (ii) prepay the Revolving Loans solely to the\nextent that the mandatory reduction associated with such repayment of Term Loans results in the Revolving Loans exceeding the\namount of the Total Revolving Commitments (after giving effect to such reduction); and\nsecond, to prepay the Term Loans on a pro rata basis as among the various Classes thereof (in accordance with the respective\noutstanding principal amounts thereof), applied to each such Class to reduce the scheduled remaining installments of principal in\ndirect order of maturity.\n(c) Application of Prepayments of Loans to Base Rate Loans and SOFR Loans. Considering each Class of Loans being\nprepaid separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to SOFR\nLoans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to Section\n2.20.\nSection II.12 Conversion and Continuation Options. Upon the expiration of the then-current Interest Period with respect to any\nLoan, such Loan shall automatically be continued as a SOFR Loan with an Interest Period of three months’ duration; provided that when any\nEvent of Default has occurred and is continuing for a period of 30 days or more or during the continuance of an Event of Default described in\nSection 7.01(f) or Section 7.01(g), (x) no Base Rate Loan may be converted to a\n67\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nSOFR Loan and (y) all Loans shall be immediately converted automatically to Base Rate Loans at such time.\nSection II.13 Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of SOFR Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this\nAgreement, all borrowings, conversions, continuations and optional prepayments of SOFR Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall\nbe in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the SOFR\nLoans comprising each SOFR Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than\n10 SOFR Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.\nSection II.14 Interest Rates and Payment Dates.\n(a) Each SOFR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to\nthe Adjusted Term SOFR determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin in effect for such day.\n(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest for each day on which it is outstanding at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate in\neffect for such day plus the Applicable Margin in effect for such day.\n(c) (i) Automatically, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default described in Section 7.01(a),\nSection 7.01(f) or Section 7.01(g) and\n(i) after notice to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, after the\noccurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default,\nthe Borrower shall pay interest on all amounts (whether or not past due) owing by it hereunder at a rate per annum at all times, after as well\nas before judgment, equal to\n(x) in the case of principal, at the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan pursuant to Section 2.14(a) or Section 2.14(b), as\napplicable, plus 2.00% per annum; and\n(y) in all other cases, at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360\ndays) equal to the rate that would be applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Facility plus 2.00% per annum,\nin each case, from the date of such Event of Default or if later, the date specified in any such notice until such Event of Default is cured or\nwaived.\n(d) Interest shall be due and payable by the Borrower in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that interest accruing\npursuant to Section 2.14(c) shall be due and payable upon demand. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms\nhereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.\n(e) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the “Prime Rate” shall be made on the basis of a\nyear of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of\na 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a\n365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made,\n68\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nand shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is\nrepaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate\nor fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.\n(f) In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make\nBenchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan\nDocument, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further\naction or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the\nBorrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the use or\nadministration of Term SOFR.\nSection II.15 Illegality\n. If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for\nany Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term\nSOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference\nRate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent) (an\n“Illegality Notice”), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to\nconvert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate”, in each case until\neach affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer\nexist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a\ncopy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate\nLoans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition\nof “Base Rate”), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to\nsuch day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or\nconversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts\nrequired pursuant to Section 2.20.\nSection II.16 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. Subject to Section 2.06, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period\nfor any SOFR Loan:\n(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that\n“Adjusted Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or\n(b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto\nor a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not\nadequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice\nof such determination to the Administrative Agent,\n69\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nthen, in each case, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.\nUpon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right\nof the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected\nSOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required\nLenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion\nto or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be\ndeemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Loan of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and\n(ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest\nPeriod. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional\namounts required pursuant to Section 2.20. Subject to Section 2.06, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be\nconclusive and binding absent manifest error) that “Adjusted Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any\ngiven day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the\ndefinition of “Base Rate” until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.\nSection II.17 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.\n(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise,\nshall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. All payments by the\nBorrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at\nthe Payment Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein.\nAny payment made by the Borrower hereunder that is received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any\nBusiness Day shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to\naccrue. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders by wire transfer promptly upon receipt in like funds as\nreceived. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the SOFR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,\nsuch payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees,\nas the case may be. If any payment on a SOFR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall\nbe extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar\nmonth, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment\nof principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.\n(b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written\nnotice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of such borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such\nLender’s share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in\naccordance with Section 2.02 or Section 2.05, as applicable, and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a\ncorresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative\nAgent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such\ncorresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such\n70\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\namount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to\nbe made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance\nwith banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate\napplicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an\noverlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such\nperiod. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such\nLender’s Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have\nagainst a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.\n(c) Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have\nreceived written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the\nLenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such\npayment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the\namount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees\nto repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from\nand including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the\nFederal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation.\n(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans and\nto make payments pursuant to Section 9.05(c) are several and not joint.

No Group Member has ever “participated” in a “reportable transaction” within the meaning of Treasury\nRegulation Section 1.6011-4. No Group Member is party to any tax sharing or similar agreement. No transaction, stamp, capital, issuance,\nregistration, transfer, withholding or other Taxes are required to be paid by Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with any\ntransfer of Portfolio Assets, or other Collateral to Administrative Agent or such Lender exercising its rights with respect thereto under the\nLoan Documents (including a foreclosure sale or other disposition).\n83\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nSection III.11 No Material Misstatements.\n(a) On the Closing Date, all reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished in writing (other than\nforward-looking information, budgets, estimates and information of a general economic or industry-specific nature) by or on behalf of the\nUltimate Parent or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the\nnegotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by other information\nso furnished), when taken as a whole, do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make\nthe statements therein when taken as a whole, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading.\n(b) The forward-looking information, budgets, estimates and information of a general economic or industry-specific nature that\nhave been furnished to the Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date, when taken as a whole, have been prepared in good faith based\nupon assumptions believed by the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made and at the time furnished (it being recognized that such\ninformation is not to be viewed as facts and that no assurance can be given that any particular financial projections will be realized, that\nactual results may differ significantly from projected results and that such projections are not a guarantee of performance).\nSection III.12 Labor Matters.\n(a) There are no strikes, lockouts, stoppages or slowdowns or other labor disputes affecting any Group Member pending or, to\nthe knowledge of the Loan Parties, threatened in writing that have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the\naggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.\n(b) All payments due from any Group Member, or for which any claim may be made against any Group Member, on account of\nwages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of such Group\nMember except to the extent that the failure to do so has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.\n(c) The hours worked by and payments made to employees of any Group Member have not been in violation of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938, as amended.\nSection III.13 ERISA.

Each Plan which is intended to qualify under\nSection 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS indicating that such Plan is so qualified and nothing\nhas occurred subsequent to the issuance of such determination letter which would cause such Plan to lose its qualified status. No liability to\nthe PBGC (other than required premium payments), the IRS, any Plan (other than in the ordinary course) or any trust established under\nTitle IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any Group Member or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates with respect to\nany Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, individually or together with any other ERISA Events, has\nhad or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefit obligations under each Single\nEmployer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Single Employer Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the\ndate on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Single Employer Plan allocable to such\naccrued benefit obligations by a material amount. As of the most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan, the potential liability of\nthe Group Members and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such\n84\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nMultiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 or Section 4205 of ERISA), when aggregated with such potential liability for a\ncomplete withdrawal from all Multiemployer Plans, is zero. The Group Members and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates have\ncomplied with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in material “default” (as\ndefined in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan. No Group Member or any of their respective\nERISA Affiliates contributes to, or has any liability with respect to, any Multiemployer Plan or has any contingent liability with respect to\nany post-retirement welfare benefit under a Plan that is subject to ERISA, other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of\nTitle I of ERISA. No Group Member or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintains or contributes to any employee benefit plan that is\nsubject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States of America.\nSection III.14 Environmental Matters\n.

For the avoidance\nof doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain\navailable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the\nAdministrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and\nirrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to\nall the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or Secured Party under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment\nReturn Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).\n(d) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any\nObligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and

Erroneous Payment.\n(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and\nhereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim\nor counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including waiver of any defense based on\n“discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.\n(f) Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 8.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the\nAdministrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or\nthe repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.\n134\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\nSection VIII.12Certain ERISA Matters.\n(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the\nevent that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable\nRequirements of Law without compliance with the provisions of this clause (vii), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed\nto be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.\n(2) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.06(c), from and after the\neffective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of\nthe interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the\nassigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations\nunder this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under\nthis Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18, Section 2.19\nand Section 9.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the\nextent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any\nclaim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a\ncopy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the\nCommitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to\ntime (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and\nthe Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all\npurposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by (x) the Borrower and (y) any Lender solely with respect to any\nentry relating to such Lender’s Loans, in each case, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.\n(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,\nsell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated\nfor the primary benefit of, a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a\nportion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans\nowing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely\nresponsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and Lenders\nshall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.05(c) with respect to any payments made by such\nLender to its Participants.\nAny agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole\nright to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that\nsuch agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,\nmodification or waiver described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (x) and (xi) of the proviso to Section 9.01(a) that affects such Participant. The\nBorrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18, Section 2.19 and Section 2.20 (subject to the\nrequirements and limitations therein, including the requirements in Section 2.19(g) (it being understood that the documentation required\nunder Section 2.19(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by\nassignment pursuant to Section 9.06(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.23 as if it were\nan assignee under Section 9.06(b); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.18 or Section 2.19 with\nrespect to any participation than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at\nthe Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.23(a)\nwith respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.07(b) as\nthough it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 9.07(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that\nsells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the\nname and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other\nobligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any\nportion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any\ncommitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such\ndisclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of\n146\n4894-9978-4110 v.2\ncredit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b)of the United States Treasury\nRegulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest\nerror, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all\npurposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity\nas Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this\nAgreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other\ncentral bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its\nobligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n(f) Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting\nLender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender\nto the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender\nwould otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a\ncommitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of\nsuch Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.

(the \"Corporation\"), a nominee for director to the Corporation's Board of\nDirectors (the \"Board\") in an uncontested election is elected if he or she receives a majority of\nthe votes cast in the election. The following procedures address the situation in which a nominee\nfor the Corporation's Board of Directors receives more votes \"against\" his or her election than\nvotes \"for\" his or her election (a \"Majority Against Vote\").\nBy accepting a nomination to stand for election or re-election as a director of the\nCorporation or an appointment as director to fill a vacancy or new directorship, each candidate,\nnominee or appointee agrees that if, in an uncontested election of directors, he or she receives a\nMajority Against Vote, the director shall promptly tender a written offer of resignation\n(substantially in the form of Exhibit A) to the Board following certification of the stockholder\nvote from the meeting at which the election occurred. For purposes of this policy, an\n\"uncontested election of directors\" is any election of directors in which the number of nominees\nfor election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected.\nThe Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\") will promptly\nconsider the director's offer of resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept the\nresignation or reject it. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation within 90 days\nfollowing certification of the stockholder vote following receipt of the recommendation.\nIn evaluating the director's resignation, each of the Committee and the Board shall\nconsider all factors they deem relevant, including (i) the perceived reasons for the Majority\nAgainst Vote, (ii) the qualifications and tenure of the director, (iii) the director's past and\nexpected future contributions to the Corporation, (iv) the overall composition of the Board and\nwhether accepting the resignation would cause the Corporation to violate any applicable rule or\nregulation (including Nasdaq Global Market listing standards and federal securities laws) or any\nof its material agreements, and (v) whether the resignation would be in the best interests of the\nCorporation and its stockholders.\nIn determining what action to recommend or take regarding the director's resignation,\neach of the Committee and the Board may consider a range of alternatives as they deem\nappropriate, including (i) accepting the resignation, (ii) rejecting the resignation, (iii) rejecting\nthe resignation to allow the director to remain on the Board but agreeing that the director will not\nbe nominated for re-election to the Board at the next election of directors, (iv) deferring\nacceptance of the resignation until the Board can find a replacement director with the necessary\nqualifications to fill the vacancy that accepting the resignation would create, or (v) deferring\nacceptance of the resignation if the director can cure the underlying cause of the Majority\nAgainst Vote within a specified period of time (for example, if the Majority Against Vote were\ndue to overboarding, by resigning from other company boards).\nAfter the Board makes a formal decision on the Committee's recommendation, the\nCorporation shall publicly disclose this action in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission within four business days of the decision. If the Board has determined to\ntake any action other than acceptance of the resignation, the Form 8-K shall also include the\nBoard's rationale supporting its decision.\nAny director who tenders his or her offer of resignation pursuant to this policy shall not\nparticipate in any deliberations or actions by the Committee or the Board regarding his or her\nresignation but shall otherwise continue to serve as a director during this period.\nIf other directors who are members of the Committee receive a Majority Against Vote in\nthe same uncontested election of directors, so that a quorum of the Committee cannot be\nachieved, then the other independent directors on the Board who received more votes \"for\" or \"in\nfavor\" than \"against\" (or \"withheld\") in that election will consider and decide what action to take\nregarding the resignation of each director who received a Majority Against Vote. If three or\nfewer independent directors on the Board did not receive a Majority Against Vote in the same\nelection, then all independent directors on the Board shall participate in deliberations and actions\nregarding director resignations except that no director can participate in the vote on his or her\nown resignation.\n* * * * *\nEXHIBIT A\n[FORM OF DIRECTOR RESIGNATION]\n__________, 20__\nThe Board of Directors\nB.

This Code summarizes basic\nguiding principles and standards of conduct to guide all employees, directors and officers of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates in meeting our goal to achieve the highest\nbusiness and personal ethical standards as well as compliance with the laws and regulations that\napply to our business. This Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures, but\nit does not address every applicable law or respond to every ethical question or concern that may\narise. All of our employees, officers and directors must conduct themselves accordingly in every\naspect of our business and seek to avoid even the appearance of wrongdoing or improper\nbehavior. Our standard has been, and will continue to be, to advance the highest standards of\nethical conduct. We expect the Company’s agents, consultants, contractors and representatives\nto be guided by the principles and standards set forth in this Code.\nIf you have questions regarding any of the goals, principles, or standards discussed or\npolicies or procedures referred to in this Code or are in doubt about the best course of action to\ntake in a particular situation, you should contact the Company’s General Counsel or another\nmember of the Legal Department, or follow the guidelines set forth in Section 16 of this Code.\nEvery director, officer and employee has a duty to adhere to this Code and those who\nviolate the standards in this Code will be subject to disciplinary action which may include\nsuspension or dismissal and/or the reporting of violative conduct to appropriate regulatory and\ncriminal authorities. If you are involved in a situation which you believe may violate or lead to\na violation of this Code, follow the guidelines described in Section 16 of this Code.\nWe are committed to continuously reviewing and updating our policies and procedures.\nTherefore, this Code is subject to modification. This Code supersedes all other such codes,\npolicies, procedures, instructions, practices, rules or written or verbal representations concerning\nthe subject matter of this Code to the extent they are inconsistent.\nPlease sign the acknowledgment form attached hereto as Exhibit A indicating that you have\nreceived, read, understand and agree to comply with this Code and return the form as instructed.\n-1-\nThe signed acknowledgment form will be located in your personnel file. Each year, as part of the\nannual review process, officers and other appropriate personnel will be asked to sign an\nacknowledgment indicating their continued understanding of and compliance with the Code. In\naddition, periodically, you may be asked to participate in seminars, training meetings and similar\nactivities related to reinforcing your understanding of this Code and its applicability to the\nCompany’s business.\n1. Honest and Candid Conduct\nEach director, officer and employee owes a duty to the Company to act with\nintegrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Deceit and\nsubordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.\nEach director, officer and employee must:\n• Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still\nmaintaining the confidentiality of information where required or consistent\nwith the Company’s policies.\n• Observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules and\nregulations, accounting standards and Company policies.\n• Adhere to a high standard of business ethics.\n2. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nObeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this\nCompany’s ethical standards are built. All employees, officers and directors must respect and obey\nthe laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate and the rules and regulations\napplicable to the Company’s business. Although not all employees are expected to know the\ndetails of all of these laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine\nwhen to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel who should\nconsult with the General Counsel or another member of the Legal Department as necessary or\nappropriate. Compliance with the law does not obviate the need to act with the highest honest and\nethical standards.\nTo promote compliance with laws, rules, regulations and the policies of the\nCompany, including insider trading rules, other securities laws, and anti-discrimination and anti-\nharassment laws and policies, the Company has established various compliance policies and\nprocedures and, where appropriate, may conduct information and training sessions.\n3. Conflicts of Interest\nA “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s personal private interest interferes\nin any way—or even appears to interfere in any way—with the interests of the Company. A\nconflict situation can arise when an employee, officer or director takes actions or has interests in\nconnection with or as a result of a material transaction or relationship that may make it difficult\nfor him or her or others to perform work or make decisions objectively and effectively in the\nCompany’s interest. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or director, or\n-2-\nmembers of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position\nin the Company. Conflicts of interest, unless approved in accordance with this Code, as\napplicable, are prohibited as a matter of Company policy. Examples include the following:\n(a) Employment/Outside Employment\nIn consideration of their employment with the Company, employees are\nexpected to devote their full attention to the business interests of the Company. Employees are\nprohibited from engaging in any activity that interferes with their performance or responsibilities\nto the Company or is otherwise in conflict with or prejudicial to the Company. Our policies\nprohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment with a client, credit source or\ncompetitor, or from taking part in any activity that enhances or supports a competitor’s position.\nIf you have any questions regarding this requirement, you should contact the General Counsel or\nanother member of the Legal Department.\n(b) Outside Directorships\nIt is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of any competitor of the\nCompany. Employees may not serve as a director of another company without first obtaining the\napproval of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”). Directors are required to\nreview with the Board of Directors other proposed directorships to confirm that accepting such\ndirectorship is consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n(c) Business Interests\nIf you are considering investing in a client, credit source or competitor, great\ncare must be taken to ensure that these investments do not compromise your responsibilities to\nthe Company. Many factors should be considered in determining whether a conflict exists,\nincluding the size and nature of the investment; your ability to influence the Company’s decisions;\nyour access to confidential information of the Company or of the other company; and the nature of\nthe relationship between the Company and the other company.\n(d) Related Parties\nAs a general rule, you should avoid conducting business or engaging in a\ntransaction on behalf of the Company with a family member or significant other, or with a company\nor firm with which you or a family member or significant other is a significant owner or associated\nor employed in a significant role or position. “Family members” include any person related by\nblood, adoption or marriage, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins,\nstepchildren, stepparents, and in-laws. “Significant others” include co- habitants, domestic\npartners, and persons with whom an employee has (or reasonably expects to have) a consensual\nromantic, sexual, intimate or dating relationship.\nThe Audit Committee must review and approve in advance all material\nrelated party transactions or business or professional relationships. All instances involving such\npotential related party transactions or business or professional relationships must be reported to the\nChief Financial Officer (“CFO”) who will assess the materiality of the transaction or relationship\nand elevate the matter to the Audit Committee as appropriate. You must not enter into, develop or\ncontinue any such material transaction or relationship without obtaining such prior Audit\n-3-\nCommittee approval. The Company must report all material related party transactions and\nbusiness or professional relationships under applicable accounting rules and the rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Any dealings with a related\nparty must be conducted in such a way as to avoid preferential treatment and assure that the terms\nobtained by the Company are no less favorable than could be obtained from unrelated parties on\nan arm’s-length basis.\nConflicts of interest or the material nature of a transaction or relationship\nmay not always be clear-cut; if questions arise, you should consult with the CFO before entering\ninto, developing or continuing a transaction that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a\nconflict of interest.\n(e) Other Situations\nBecause other conflicts of interest may arise, it would be impractical to\nattempt to list all possible situations. Any employee, officer or director who becomes aware of a\nconflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest should bring it to the attention of a supervisor,\nmanager or other appropriate personnel or consult the guidelines described in Section 16 of this\nCode.\n4. Insider Trading\nEmployees, officers and directors who have access to confidential information are\nnot permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose\nexcept the conduct of the Company’s business. All non-public information about the Company\nshould be considered confidential information. To use non-public information about the Company\nor any other company for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an\ninvestment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. Please\nrefer to the Company’s Insider Trading Policy for additional information. The purpose of such\npolicy is both to inform you of your legal responsibilities and to make clear to you that the misuse\nof sensitive information is contrary to Company policies and to set forth procedures with respect\nto trading in the Company’s securities.\n5. Public Disclosure\nThe Company is committed to providing full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable disclosure in the periodic reports and other information it files with or submits to\nthe SEC and in other public communications, such as press releases, earnings conference calls and\nindustry conferences, made by the Company. In meeting such standards for disclosure, the\nCompany’s executive officers and directors shall at all times comply with the Company’s\ndisclosure obligations pursuant to applicable securities laws and SEC rules and, as necessary,\nappropriately consider and balance the need or desirability for confidentiality with respect to non-\npublic negotiations or other business developments. The Company’s CEO and CFO are\nresponsible for establishing effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls\nover financial reporting within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations. The\nCompany expects the CEO and CFO to take leadership roles in implementing such controls and\nprocedures and to position the Company to comply with its disclosure obligations and otherwise\nmeet the foregoing standards for public disclosure. Inadvertent public disclosure of the Company’s\nmaterial non-public information should be reported immediately to the CEO and CFO. Each\n-4-\ndirector, officer or employee who is involved in the Company’s disclosure process must:\n(a) be familiar with and comply with the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures and its internal control over financial reporting;\n(b) not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts\nabout the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including to the\nCompany’s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;\n(c) properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for\naccuracy and completeness (or, where appropriate, delegate this task to others); and\n(d) take all necessary steps to ensure that all filings with the SEC and all\nother public communications about the financial and business condition of the Company\nprovide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.\nNo employee, officer or director should interfere with, hinder or obstruct the\nCompany’s efforts to meet the standards for public disclosure set forth above.\nWe communicate with the press and others making inquiries through official\nchannels only. All inquiries received from the media concerning the Company should be handled\nin accordance with the Company’s Regulation FD Policy or directed to the Company’s General\nCounsel.\n6. Corporate Opportunities\nEmployees, officers and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance the\nCompany’s business interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Employees, officers and\ndirectors are prohibited from exploiting for their own personal gain opportunities that are\ndiscovered through the use of corporate property, information or position unless the opportunity\nis fully disclosed to the Board and the Board declines to pursue such opportunity. No employee,\nofficer or director may use corporate property, information, or position for improper personal\ngain, and no employee may compete with the Company directly or indirectly. Employees, officers\nand directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interest when the opportunity to\ndo so arises.\nSometimes the line between personal and Company benefits is difficult to draw,\nand sometimes there are both personal and Company benefits in certain activities. If you intend to\nmake use of Company property or services in a manner not solely for the benefit of the Company,\nplease consult beforehand with your supervisor.\n7. Competition and Fair Dealing\nWe seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. We seek competitive\nadvantages through superior performance, never through unethical or illegal business practices.\nWe must comply with Fair Competition laws, including U.S antitrust rules, which are designed to\nprohibit agreements or actions that reduce competition and harm customers. Stealing proprietary\ninformation, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner’s consent,\nor inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited. Each\n-5-\nemployee, officer and director should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with the\nCompany’s clients, consultants, competitors and other employees. No employee, officer or director\nshould take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing practice.\nThe purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create\ngood will and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers. No gift\nor entertainment should ever be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Company employee,\nofficer, director, family member of any of the foregoing or agent unless it:\n• is not a cash gift,\n• is consistent with customary business practices,\n• is not excessive in value,\n• cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff and does not create an appearance\nof impropriety, and\n• is in compliance with the Company’s policy on gifts and gratuities and\ndoes not violate any laws or rules or regulations.\nPlease discuss with your supervisor any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not\ncertain are appropriate.\n8. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe diversity of the Company’s employees is a tremendous asset. It is the\nCompany’s policy to provide equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees. The\nCompany does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including\npregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, national origin, age,\ndisability, marital status, veteran status, or any other basis prohibited under federal, state or local\nlaw. In addition, the Company is committed to providing a workplace free of unlawful harassment.\nThis includes not only sexual harassment, but also harassment on any of the bases set forth above.\nThe Company strongly disapproves of and will not tolerate harassment of employees by managers,\nsupervisors, co-workers or non-employees. Similarly, the Company will not tolerate harassment\nby its employees of non-employees with whom Company employees have a business, service, or\nprofessional relationship. For information about the Company’s policies against discrimination\nand harassment, please refer to the Company’s Employee Handbook. All of our employees\ndeserve a positive work environment where they will be respected and we are committed to\nproviding an environment that supports honesty, integrity, respect, trust and responsibility. All of\nour employees should contribute to the creation and maintenance of such an environment and our\nexecutive officers and management and supervisory personnel should take a leadership role in\nachieving a work environment that meets our diversity standards and is free from the fear of\nretribution.\n9. Health and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work\n-6-\nenvironment. Each employee has a responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for\nall employees by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries\nand unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.\nViolence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees should report to\nwork in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The\nuse of illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated.\n10. Record-Keeping\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth and convey the Company’s requirements\nin managing records, including all recorded information regardless of medium or characteristics.\nRecords include paper documents, CDs, computer hard disks, email, floppy disks, microfiche,\nmicrofilm or all other media. The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting\nof information in order to make responsible business decisions.\nMany employees, officers and directors regularly use business expense accounts,\nwhich must be documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense\nis legitimate, ask your supervisor or the CFO. Please refer to the Company’s business travel policy\nfor further information regarding business expenses.\nThe Company’s responsibilities to its stockholders and the investing public require\nthat all of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in\nreasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions and must conform both to\napplicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls and generally\naccepted accounting practices and principles. Each director, officer or employee must cooperate\nfully with the Company’s accounting and internal audit departments, as well as the Company’s\nindependent public accountants and counsel. No one should rationalize or even consider\nmisrepresenting facts or falsifying records. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets should\nnot be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation.\nBusiness records and communications often become public, and we should avoid\nexaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and\ncompanies that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to email, internal memos, and formal\nreports. Records should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record\nretention policies. No record or document shall be destroyed which is the subject of a subpoena or\nother legal process or if there is a reasonable belief that litigation proceedings or government\ninvestigative proceedings are likely to occur and it is anticipated that such record or document is\nrelevant to such proceedings. All employees are expected to comply with all federal, state and\nindustry-specific record retention rules and requirements as well as the Company’s record retention\npolicies.\n11. Confidentiality\nEmployees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential\ninformation entrusted to them by the Company or its customers, except when disclosure is\nauthorized by the CEO or CFO or required by law or other regulations. Confidential information\nincludes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company\n-7-\nor its customers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers and customers have\nentrusted to us. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after\nemployment ends.\nThe Company and its employees, agents, consultants and contractors must\ncooperate with appropriate government inquiries and investigations. In this context, however, it is\nimportant to protect the legal rights of the Company with respect to its confidential information. To\nthe extent permitted by law, all government inquiries and requests for information, documents or\ninvestigative interviews (whether in person, by phone, email or written correspondence) must be\nreferred to the General Counsel, who will be responsible for coordinating a response. No financial\ninformation may be disclosed without the prior approval of the CFO. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, nothing in this Code limits any of the Company’s employees, agents, consultants and\ncontractors from initiating communications directly with, providing truthful information to,\nreporting possible violations of law or regulation to, or filing a claim or assisting with any\ninvestigation directly with a self-regulatory authority or any governmental agency or entity.\nSeveral countries (including Canada, Argentina, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia)\nand the European Union have strict rules with respect to collection of Personal Information about\nindividuals, which apply to companies that collect information about their employees. Personal\nInformation may include information that would be routinely gathered in the U.S. such as home\naddress, contact information, and personnel information. Many of these rules prohibit transmission\nof Personal Information about individuals from outside the U.S. into the U.S., unless certain\nsafeguards are provided with respect to the Personal Information transmitted into the U.S. All\nemployees outside the U.S. should use care with respect to collection, storage and transmission of\nany Personal Information to ensure compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws\nand regulations. All employees inside the U.S should use care with respect to receiving or obtaining\nany Personal Information from locations outside the U.S. All employees in any location should\nraise any questions about appropriate treatment of Personal Information with the Company’s\nGeneral Counsel or another member of the Legal Department.\n12. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees, directors and officers should endeavor to protect the Company’s property,\nelectronic communications systems, information resources, facilities and equipment and ensure\ntheir efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s\nprofitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for\ninvestigation pursuant to Section 16 of this Code. Company assets should not be used for non-\nCompany business, although we recognize that incidental personal use may be permitted without\nadversely affecting the interests of the Company. Personal use of Company assets must always be\nin accordance with Company policy. You should consult your supervisor for appropriate guidance\nand permission.\nThe obligation of employees, directors and officers to protect the Company’s assets\nincludes its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as\ntrade secrets, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans,\ndesigns, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports.\nUnauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate Company policy. It could also\nbe illegal and result in civil or even criminal penalties.\n-8-\nUnauthorized duplication of copyrighted computer software violates the law. You\nmust neither engage in nor tolerate the making or using of unauthorized software copies and must\ncomply will all license and purchase terms regulating the use of any software. The Company will\nprovide all software needed to meet legitimate needs.\n13. Payments to Government Personnel\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly\nor indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain\nor retain business. It is strictly prohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any\ncountry.\nIn addition, there are a number of federal and state laws and regulations regarding\nbusiness gratuities which may be accepted by U.S. or state government personnel. The promise,\noffer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government or a state government of a gift,\nfavor or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Company policy but could\nalso be a criminal offense. Local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar\nrules. You must consult with the General Counsel or another member of the Legal Department\nprior to making any such gifts.\n14. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\nAny waiver of any provision of this Code for executive officers or directors must\nbe approved by the Board and will be promptly disclosed as required by applicable securities law\nor stock exchange regulation. With regard to employees who are not executive officers, waivers\nmust be approved by the General Counsel.\n15. Reporting any Illegal or Unethical Behavior; No Retaliation\nIt is your obligation and ethical responsibility to help enforce this Code, and to that end, you must\npromptly report violations of this Code in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 16 of\nthis Code. Employees, officers and directors are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or\nother appropriate personnel about observed or suspected illegal, improper or unethical behavior\nand when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. You should know that\nreprisal, threats, retribution or retaliation against any person who has in good faith reported a\nviolation or a suspected violation of law, this Code or other Company policies, or against any person\nwho is assisting in any investigation or process with respect to such a violation, is both a violation\nof Company policy and is prohibited by a variety of state and federal civil and criminal laws\nincluding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Company not to\nallow retaliation for reports of wrongdoing or misconduct by others made in good faith by\nemployees. Employees, officers and directors are expected to cooperate in internal investigations\nof wrongdoing or misconduct.\n16. Accounting Complaints\nThe Company's policy is to comply with all applicable financial reporting and\naccounting regulations. If any employee, officer or director of the Company has unresolved\nconcerns or complaints regarding questionable accounting, internal control or auditing matters of\nthe Company, then he or she is encouraged to submit those concerns or complaints in accordance\n-9-\nwith the Company’s Complaint Procedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters.\n17. Compliance Procedures\nWe must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this\nCode. However, in some situations it is difficult to know right from wrong. Since we cannot\nanticipate every situation that will arise, you should keep in mind the following steps as you\nconsider a particular problem or concern.\n(a) Make sure you have all the facts. In order to reach the right\nsolutions, we must be as fully informed as possible.\n(b) Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do or ignore? Does\nit seem illegal, unethical or improper?

Supervisors are obligated to report violations of this Code to the General Counsel\nor another member of the Legal Department.\n(e) In the case where it may not be appropriate to report a violation to or\ndiscuss your concerns with your supervisor, or where you do not feel comfortable approaching\nyour supervisor to report a violation or discuss your concerns, you may report the violation or\ndiscuss your concerns with the General Counsel or another member of the Legal Department.

          "content": "POLICY STATEMENT\nDate Issued: September 30, 2009\nDate Amended: November 6, 2014\nSubject: Corporate Governance Guidelines\nDate Amended: February 16, 2017\nDate Amended: May 21, 2019\nApproved by: Board of Directors Distribution:\nDate: May 21, 2019\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of B. Riley Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n(the “Company”), has adopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines”) to advance the functioning of the Board and its committees and set forth the Board’s\nexpectations as to how it should perform its functions. These Guidelines are subject to\nmodification from time to time by the Board as the Board may deem appropriate in the best\ninterests of the Company or as required by applicable laws. The Guidelines should be interpreted\nin the context of all applicable laws and the Company’s Charter, bylaws and other corporate\ngovernance documents.\nBoard Responsibility\n1. Role of the Board\nThe Company’s business shall be conducted by its officers, managers and employees,\nunder the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the Board. The directors\nare elected by the stockholders to oversee management and to exercise their business judgment in\nthe best interests of the Company. In addition to its general oversight of management, the Board\nor its committees perform the following principal functions:\n• Review, evaluate, and, where appropriate, approve the Company’s business\nstrategies and long-term plans, and evaluate its performance against such plans;\n• Review, evaluate and approve major corporate actions;\n• Oversee management’s efforts to establish and maintain for the Company the\nhighest standards of legal and ethical conduct, including with respect to the\nintegrity of the Company’s accounting, financial reporting and finance processes\nand systems of internal control, compliance with law and ethics, and the integrity\nof relationships with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders; and\n• Select, evaluate and compensate the Company’s executive officers and review\nmanagement succession planning.\nIn order to facilitate the effective performance of such Board functions, the following\nminimum expectations apply to directors:\n87776681v.2 -1-\n• All directors are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings of committees\non which they serve, prepare for meetings, review relevant materials, ask\nquestions and engage in discussion, and spend the time needed and meet as\nfrequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. Participation\nby telephone is appropriate in the event of scheduling conflicts.\n• Directors should be familiar with the Company’s business, its financial statements\nand capital structure, and the risks and competition it faces, to facilitate active and\neffective participation in the Board and committee meetings he or she attends.\nDirectors are expected to maintain an attitude of constructive involvement and\noversight; they are expected to ask incisive, probing questions and require\naccurate, honest answers; they are expected to act with integrity; and they are\nexpected to demonstrate a commitment to the Company, its values, its business\nplan, long-term stockholder value and the Company’s dividend policy.\nIn performing their oversight role, directors shall rely in good faith on the\ncompetence and integrity of management in carrying out their responsibilities. It is the\nresponsibility of management to operate the Company in an effective and ethical manner in\norder to produce value for stockholders.\nAll directors owe a duty of loyalty to the Company which mandates that the best interests\nof the Company prevail over any individual interests of a director.\nBoard Composition\n2. Board Size\nThe Board periodically reviews the appropriate size of the Board, which may vary to\naccommodate the availability of suitable candidates and the needs of the Company, subject to\nthe requirements of the Company’s bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware (the “DGCL”).\n3. Selection of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThe Board may select the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer as it\nmay determine from time to time in the best interests of the Company. These offices may be\nfilled by one individual or two different individuals.\n4. Selection of Board Members\nPursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated\nAugust 17, 2015 (the “Charter”), all directors will hold office for one-year terms expiring at the next\nannual meeting of stockholders.\nThe Board recommends to the stockholders a slate of nominees for election at the\nCompany’s annual meeting of stockholders. Between annual meetings of stockholders, the Board\nmay appoint directors to fill vacancies to serve until the next annual meeting. Pursuant to the\n87776681v.2 -2-\ndeclassified board structure set forth in the Charter, any director chosen as a result of a newly\ncreated directorship or to fill a vacancy on the Board would hold office until the next annual\nmeeting of stockholders. The Corporate Governance Committee selects and recommends to the\nBoard the slate of director nominees for election at the annual meeting and the individual\nnominees to otherwise be appointed to fill vacancies between annual meetings, in accordance\nwith the policies and principles contained in these Guidelines and the requirements of the\nCompany’s Charter and bylaws. Stockholders may propose nominees for consideration by the\nCorporate Governance Committee by submitting the names and supporting information to the\nCompany’s Secretary in accordance with the Company’s Stockholder Nominations and\nCommunications Policy.\nConsistent with the DGCL, stockholders are permitted to remove directors elected to one-\nyear terms with or without cause.\n5. Board Membership Criteria; Other Directorships or Commitments\nThe Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing, on an annual basis,\nthe requisite skills and characteristics of individual Board members, as well as the composition\nof the Board as a whole, in the context of the needs of the Company. The Corporate Governance\nCommittee will review all nominees for director in accordance with the requirements and\nqualifications contained in these Guidelines and will recommend that the Board select those\nnominees whose attributes it believes would be most beneficial to the Company. This review\nwill involve an assessment of the proposed nominees’ personal qualities and characteristics,\naccomplishments and business reputation. The Corporate Governance Committee will assess\ncandidates’ qualifications based on the following minimum criteria which may be modified from\ntime to time by the Corporate Governance Committee:\n• Demonstrated personal integrity and moral character;\n• Willingness to apply sound and independent business judgment for the long-term\ninterests of stockholders;\n• Relevant business or professional experience, technical expertise or specialized\nskills;\n• Personality traits and background, including the diverse nature of the candidate,\nthat allow the candidate to provide a broad range of perspectives, experience and\nexpertise required to achieve effective stewardship and to fulfill their duties to the\nCompany and its stockholders; and\n• Ability to commit sufficient time to effectively carry out the substantial duties of a\ndirector.\nDue to competitive, confidentiality and legal considerations, the Corporate Governance\nCommittee and the Board will not consider as a director candidate anyone who is an officer,\ndirector or principal of an enterprise which is in substantial competition with the Company.\n87776681v.2 -3-\nThe Company values the experience directors bring from other boards on which they serve\nand other activities in which they participate, but recognizes that those boards and activities may\nalso present demands on a director’s time and availability and may present conflicts or legal\nissues, including independence issues. Directors should advise the Chairman of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee and the Chief Executive Officer before accepting a nomination or\nappointment to membership on another board of directors or any Audit Committee or other\nsignificant committee assignment on any other board of directors, or establishing other significant\nrelationships with businesses, institutions, governmental units or regulatory entities, particularly\nthose that may result in significant time commitments or a change in the director’s relationship to\nthe Company. Directors should not serve on more than five other public company boards of\ndirectors in addition to the Board.\n6. Change in Job Responsibility\nThe Board believes that directors who retire from their present employment, or materially\nchange their position, should notify the Corporate Governance Committee so it can assess whether\nthe director continues to meet the Board’s qualifications criteria under the circumstances and the\nCorporate Governance Committee should make a recommendation based on its findings.\nRetirement or material change in position should not necessarily preclude a director’s continued\nservice on the Board; however, the Corporate Governance Committee should be in a position to\nassess the effect of such a change in its evaluation of the appropriate mix of skills and experience\nnecessary for the Board to perform its oversight function effectively.\n7. Term Limits\nThe Board does not believe it is advisable to limit the number of terms for which an\nindividual may serve as a director. Directors who have served on the Board for an extended period\nof time are able to provide valuable insight into the Company’s business based on their experience\nand understanding of the Company’s history, policies and objectives. The Board believes that it\ncan, as necessary, utilize the nominating process described above to elect or appoint new directors\nto obtain new ideas and viewpoints regarding the Company’s business and affairs.\n8. Retirement Policy\nThe Board has determined not to establish a mandatory retirement age.\nAlternatively, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board will review each\ndirector’s continuation on the Board upon reaching the age of 75 and each year thereafter.\n9. Director Independence\nAt least a majority of the Board and all of the members of the Audit Committee, the\nCompensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee will at all times be\ncomprised of directors who qualify as independent directors in accordance with applicable rules\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the listing standards of The Nasdaq\nStock Market (“Nasdaq”), which focus on a director’s independence from the management of the\nCompany.\nBoard Meetings\n87776681v.2 -4-\n10. Board Meeting Schedule and Agenda\nThe Board shall have at least four regularly scheduled meetings each year.\nAdditional unscheduled Board meetings may be called upon appropriate notice at any time\nto address specific needs of the business. The Chairman of the Board will establish the agenda for\neach Board meeting. Each Board member is encouraged to suggest the inclusion of items on the\nagenda at any time. The Board will review the Company’s long-term strategic plan and the\nfundamental factors affecting the Company’s successful operation of its business during at least\none meeting each year. The Chief Executive Officer and Secretary shall attend all non-executive\nsessions of the Board, and other members of management may attend non-executive sessions of\nthe Board at the invitation of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board.\n11. Advance Distribution of Materials\nInformation and data that are important to the Board’s understanding of the business to be\nconducted at a Board or committee meeting should generally be distributed in writing to the\ndirectors before the meeting. Directors should review these materials in advance of the meeting\nto preserve time at the meeting and to provoke questions and discussion about the material. On\ncertain occasions where the subject matter is too sensitive to put in writing, the matter will be\ndiscussed at the meeting.\n12. Presiding Director\nAt their discretion, the non-management directors may elect one director from among their\nmembership as Presiding Director. Responsibilities of the Presiding Director shall include:\nleadership of executive sessions of the Board; consultation with the Chairman of the Board\nconcerning the agenda for Board meetings; input as to the kind of material to be provided to the\nBoard in consultation with the Chairman of the Board; facilitation of communications between\nthe Board and management; focal point for stockholder communications addressed to independent\nor non-management directors; ability to retain outside professionals on behalf of the Board as the\nBoard may determine is necessary or appropriate; and such other functions as the Board may\ndirect.\n13. Executive Session\nThe non-management directors of the Board will meet in executive session at least two\ntimes per year and will have an opportunity to meet in executive session at each regular meeting\nof the Board. Executive session discussions may include such topics as the non-management\ndirectors determine, but actions of the Board should be taken separately at a formal Board meeting.\nThe Presiding Director, or if one shall not have been designated, the Chairman of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee, shall serve as chairman for any executive session of the Board. If the\nnon-management directors include any non-independent directors, independent directors will\nmeet at least once a year in executive session.\nCommittees of the Board\n87776681v.2 -5-\n14. Number of Committees\nThe Board will have at all times an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a\nCorporate Governance Committee. All of the members of these committees will satisfy the\napplicable independence requirements of Nasdaq and the SEC, as and when required. The Board\nmay have additional committees as it determines from time to time are necessary or appropriate.\n15. Committee Membership\nCommittee members will be appointed by the Board upon recommendation of the\nCorporate Governance Committee after taking into account the desires, experiences and expertise\nof individual directors. The Board believes that consideration should be given to rotating\ncommittee members periodically, but the Board does not believe that rotation should be mandated\nas a policy. Audit Committee members shall not serve simultaneously on the Audit Committee\nof more than two other companies, unless the Board determines that such service will not impair\nthe member’s ability to serve on the Audit Committee.\n16. Committee Structure\nEach committee will have its own charter. The charters will set forth the purposes, goals\nand responsibilities of the committees as well as qualifications for committee membership,\nprocedures for committee member appointment and removal, committee structure and operations\nand committee reporting to the Board. The charters will also provide that each committee will\nannually evaluate its performance and assess the adequacy of its charter and will otherwise comply\nwith Nasdaq’s listing standards and applicable SEC regulations.\n17. Committee Meetings\nThe chairperson of each committee, in consultation with the committee members, will\ndetermine the frequency and length of the committee meetings consistent with any requirements\nset forth in the committee’s charter. The chairperson of each committee, in consultation with the\nappropriate members of the committee and management, will develop the committee’s agenda.\nEach committee chair will periodically give a report of his or her committee’s activities to the\nBoard.\nDirector Access and Stockholder Communications\n18. Director Access to Officers and Employees\nDirectors have full and free access to officers and employees of the Company. Any\nmeetings or contacts that a director wishes to initiate may be arranged through the Chief Executive\nOfficer or the Secretary or directly by the director. Any such contact should be done in a way that\nis not disruptive to the business operations of the Company. Any non-routine written\ncommunications between a director and an officer or employee of the Company should be copied\nto the Chief Executive Officer and, as appropriate, to the Secretary.\n19. Stockholder Communications with the Board\n87776681v.2 -6-\nThe Board and the non-management directors welcome communications from\nstockholders and interested parties. Stockholders or interested parties may submit\ncommunications addressed to the Board or the non-management directors to the Secretary in\naccordance with the Company’s Stockholder Nominations and Communications Policy.\n20. Director Access to Outside Advisors\nThe Board and each committee shall have the power to hire independent legal, financial\nor other advisors as they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the approval of\nany officer of the Company in advance.\n21. Board’s Role in Communications\nThe Board believes that executive management speaks for the Company, has the\nresponsibility to communicate with investors, the press and other constituencies, and to establish\npolicies for those communications under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer. At the\nrequest of management, individual Board members may, from time to time, meet or otherwise\ncommunicate with various constituencies that are involved with the Company.\nDirector Remuneration\n22. Director Compensation\nThe form and amount of director compensation will be determined by the Compensation\nCommittee in accordance with the policies and principles set forth in its charter and these\nGuidelines and then recommended to the full Board. All directors are expected to own stock in the\nCompany in an amount that is appropriate for them. Management shall report to the\nCompensation Committee annually on an assessment of the Company’s director compensation\nmeasured against comparable companies. Board compensation should be consistent with market\npractices, but should not be set at a level that would call into question the Board’s objectivity.\nIndependent directors serving on the Audit Committee will receive no additional compensation, in\nthe form of consulting fees or other specific benefits, beyond that provided for service on the\nBoard or a committee. Any chairperson of a committee may receive additional compensation for\nsuch duties.\nChief Executive Officer Compensation, Evaluation and Succession\n23. Chief Executive Officer Compensation and Evaluation\nThe Compensation Committee shall annually approve the goals and objectives for\ncompensating the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee shall evaluate the\nChief Executive Officer’s performance in light of these goals and objectives before setting the\nChief Executive Officer’s salary, bonus and other incentive and equity compensation. The\nCompensation Committee shall also annually approve the compensation structure for the\nCompany’s officers, and shall evaluate the performance of the Company’s senior executive\nofficers before approving their salary, bonus and other incentive and equity compensation.\n87776681v.2 -7-\n24. Succession Plan\nThe Board of Directors shall establish and regularly review the policies and procedures\nregarding succession to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management positions.\nMiscellaneous\n25. Board and Committee Evaluation\nBoard positions should not be regarded as permanent. Directors should serve only so long\nas they add value to the Board, and a director’s ability to continue to contribute to the Board\nshould be considered each time the director is considered for renomination. The Board will have\na process for reviewing and evaluating the performance of the Board and its committees annually\nto determine whether the Board and the committees are functioning effectively. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee shall be responsible for overseeing the Board and committee evaluation\nprocess and reporting its assessments to the Board.\n26. Director Orientation and Continuing Education\nAs needed, the Company will conduct an orientation process for new directors to\nfamiliarize them with the Company’s operations, management structure, financial matters,\ncorporate governance practices and other key policies and practices through a review of\nbackground material and meetings with senior management. The Board also recognizes the\nimportance of continuing education for its directors and is committed to provide such education\nin order to improve both Board and committee performance.\n27. Review of Governance Guidelines\nThe Board expects to review these guidelines at least every two years as appropriate.\n28. Disclosure of Corporate Governance Guidelines\nThese Guidelines will be made available on the Company’s web site.\n87776681v.2 -8-"

These are the responsibilities of\nmanagement and the independent auditors. In addition, the Committee recognizes that the\nCompany’s management, internal audit staff, and independent auditors devote more time to\nreviewing and analyzing the Company’s business and operations and as a result, have more\nknowledge and detailed information concerning the Company than do members of the\nCommittee.

The Committee shall have the authority and sufficient funding to retain outside\nlegal counsel, accountants or other experts as it determines necessary and appropriate to assist\nthe Committee in carrying out its functions, without obtaining the approval of the Board or\n4866-9924-3088 v.1.2\nmanagement. The Company shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the\nCommittee, in its capacity as a committee of the Board, for payment of:\n• Compensation to the independent auditors and any other public accounting\nfirm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or\nperforming other audit, review or attest services for the Company;\n• Compensation of any advisers employed by the Committee; and\n• Ordinary administrative expenses of the Committee that are necessary or\nappropriate in carrying out its duties.\nIf any term of this Charter conflicts with any term of the Company’s Certificate of\nIncorporation or Bylaws, the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, as the case\nmay be, shall control.\nThe Committee will maintain written minutes of its meetings and copies of its\nactions by written consent. The minutes and copies of written consents will be filed with the\nminutes of the meetings of the Board. The Chair will report to the Board from time to time with\nrespect to the activities of the Committee, including on significant matters related to the\nCommittee’s responsibilities and the Committee’s deliberations and actions.\nThis Charter will be made available on the Company’s web site.\n4866-9924-3088 v.1.2"
