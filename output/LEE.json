Nearly two-thirds of our total company gross margin was derived from digital sources, positioning us close to our goal of being sustainable from our digital products only. This positions us well to be vibrant and growing in the medium and long-term with the rapid growth of our digital revenue streams.”\n\n“Our investment thesis is grounded in this transformation as we replace print revenue and margin with digital revenue and margin that are growing at a rapid clip. Total Digital Revenue has grown 17% annually over the last three years, and we expect this strong growth to continue,” Mowbray added.\n\n“Our third quarter performance was highlighted by a marked improvement in revenue trends alongside effective management of operating expenses. As a result of our engaging hyper-local content, improved brand awareness, and sophisticated marketing campaigns, we now have 748,000 digital subscribers, a 23% increase over the prior year. Digital-only subscription revenue grew 34%(2) and totaled $79 million over the last twelve months, more than halfway towards our long-term target of $150 million. On the advertising side, Amplified Digital® Agency’s third quarter revenue grew 12%(2) over the prior year with annualized revenue more than $100 million,” Mowbray added.\n\n“As a result of the persistent acceleration of print revenue declines, we are updating our full year Adjusted EBITDA(4) outlook to the range of $73 million to $78 million and Total Cash Costs(4) between $550 million and $560 million. This update is necessary as we manage operating expenses through the acceleration of secular print revenue trends combined with moving through cyclical changes in the advertising environment. The print business will be less impactful on future operating results due to the digital revenue inflection point and margin transformation. With only one-third of the Company’s gross margin tied to print products in the third quarter, changes in the print business will be less impactful on our operating results in the future,” said Mowbray.\n\n“Given the strong performance of our digital revenue streams, we are reaffirming our Total Digital Revenue outlook of between $310 million and $330 million.”\n\n\"The rapid and consistent growth of our digital subscriptions and revenue, the expansion of Amplified Digital® Agency marketing solutions, and thoughtful investments into our digital business are proof we are steadily becoming sustainable solely from the revenue and cash flow generated from our digital products,\" added Mowbray.\n\n**_Key Third Quarter Highlights:_**\n\n  * Total operating revenue was $151 million. Operating revenue was affected by accelerated declines of our print revenue streams and eliminated certain print products, partially offset by growth in digital revenue.\n  * Total Digital Revenue was $76 million, a 9% increase over the prior year(2), and represented 50% of our total operating revenue.\n  * Revenue from digital-only subscribers totaled $21 million up 34% over the prior year(2).\n  * Digital advertising and marketing services revenue represented 72% of our total advertising revenue and totaled $50 million.\n  * Digital services revenue, which is predominantly from BLOX Digital, totaled $5 million in the quarter.\n  * Operating expenses totaled $147 million and Cash Costs totaled $138 million, a 8% and 8% decrease compared to the prior year, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA totaled $15 million.\n\n\n\n**_2024 Fiscal Year Outlook (updated):_**\n\nTotal Digital Revenue| $310 million (+13% YOY) - $330 million (+21% YOY)  \n---|---  \nDigital-only subscribers| 771,000 (+7% YOY)  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $73 million (-14% YOY) - $78 million (-8% YOY)  \n  \n**_Debt and Free Cash Flow:_**\n\nThe Company has $453 million of debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement(5) with BH Finance. The financing has favorable terms including a 25-year maturity, a fixed annual interest rate of 9.0%, no fixed principal payments, and no financial performance covenants.\n\nAs of and for the period ended June 23, 2024:\n\n  * The principal amount of debt decreased $3 million year to date, and totals $453 million.\n  * Cash on the balance sheet totaled $13 million. Debt, net of cash on the balance sheet, totaled $439 million.\n  * Capital expenditures totaled $4 million for the quarter and $7 million year to date. We expect approximately $10 million of capital expenditures in FY24.\n  * We expect cash paid for income taxes to total between $9 million and $14 million in 2024.\n  * We do not expect any material pension contributions in the fiscal year as our plans are fully funded in the aggregate.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Information:_**\n\nAs previously announced, we will hold an earnings conference call and audio webcast today at 9 a.m. Central Time. The live webcast will be accessible at www.lee.net and will be available for replay 24 hours later. Analysts have been invited to ask questions on the call.

Operating Revenue| 150,577| 165,562| 451,543| 503,523  \n  \n**NOTES**\n\n(1) Total Digital Revenue is defined as digital advertising and marketing services revenue (including Amplified Digital® Agency), digital-only subscription revenue and digital services revenue.\n\n(2) Same-store revenues is a non-GAAP performance measure based on U.S. GAAP revenues for Lee for the current period, excluding exited operations. Exited operations include (1) business divestitures and (2) the elimination of stand-alone print products discontinued within our markets.\n\n(3) This earnings release is a preliminary report of results for the periods included. The reader should refer to the Company's most recent reports on Form 10-Q and on Form 10-K for definitive information.\n\n(4) The following are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures for which reconciliations to relevant U.S GAAP measures are included in tables accompanying this release:\n\n  * _Adjusted EBITDA_ is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that enhances financial statement users overall understanding of the operating performance of the Company. The measure isolates unusual, infrequent or non-cash transactions from the operating performance of the business. This allows users to easily compare operating performance among various fiscal periods and how management measures the performance of the business. This measure also provides users with a benchmark that can be used when forecasting future operating performance of the Company that excludes unusual, nonrecurring or one-time transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by stockholders and analysts to determine the value of our business when using the market approach, which applies a market multiple to financial metrics. It is also a measure used to calculate the leverage ratio of the Company, which is a key financial ratio monitored and used by the Company and its investors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus non-operating expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, restructuring costs and other, stock compensation and our 50% share of EBITDA from TNI and MNI, minus equity in earnings of TNI and MNI.\n  * Cash Costs represent a non-GAAP financial performance measure of operating expenses which are measured on an accrual basis and settled in cash. This measure is useful to investors in understanding the components of the Company’s cash-settled operating costs. Periodically, the Company provides forward-looking guidance of Cash Costs, which can be used by financial statement users to assess the Company's ability to manage and control its operating cost structure. Cash Costs are defined as compensation, newsprint and ink and other operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, other non-cash operating expenses and other expenses are excluded. Cash Costs also exclude restructuring costs and other, which are typically paid in cash.\n\n\n\n(5) The Company's debt is the $576 million term loan under a credit agreement with BH Finance LLC dated January 29, 2020 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). Excess Cash Flow is defined under the Credit Agreement as any cash greater than $20,000,000 on the balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the quarter ending June 28, 2020.\n\n(6) TNI refers to TNI Partners publishing operations in Tucson, AZ. MNI refers to Madison Newspapers, Inc. publishing operations in Madison, WI.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NzgwMjY3MzEtNTg3My00NDQyLTg5ZDktNTliMzE3YmE2MmJmLTEwMTczNzg=/tiny/Lee-Enterprises-Inc-.png)\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\n[](#)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://investors.lee.net/news-releases/news-release-details/lee-enterprises-nears-digital-sustainability-revenue-inflection&t=Lee Enterprises, Inc. - Lee Enterprises nears digital sustainability with revenue inflection point \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Lee Enterprises, Inc. - Lee Enterprises nears digital sustainability with revenue inflection point+https://investors.lee.net/news-releases/news-release-details/lee-enterprises-nears-digital-sustainability-revenue-inflection \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://investors.lee.net/news-releases/news-release-details/lee-enterprises-nears-digital-sustainability-revenue-inflection&title=Lee Enterprises, Inc. - Lee Enterprises nears digital sustainability with revenue inflection point \"LinkedIn\")\n\n\n"
