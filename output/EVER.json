We are strategically investing into this strengthening demand environment, as we continue to effectively optimize our traffic operations, improve our AI-powered bidding solutions, and roll-out our next generation agent technology platform.\"\n\n“Our record third quarter financial results and cash flow are evidence that we are emerging from the auto insurance downturn as a stronger company due to our ability to efficiently scale, drive strong operational leverage, and maintain disciplined expense management,” said Joseph Sanborn, CFO of EverQuote. “Looking ahead, we expect to build upon our strong performance this year, while judiciously investing to position ourselves as the leader in our industry.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**(Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are relative to the third quarter of 2023).\n\n  * Total revenue of $144.5 million, an increase of 163%.\n  * Automotive insurance vertical revenue of $130.0 million, up 202%, and representing 90% of revenue.\n  * Home and renters insurance vertical revenue of $14.1 million, up 30% compared to $10.9 million.\n  * VMM increased to $43.9 million, compared to VMM of $19.4 million.\n  * GAAP net income improved to $11.6 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $29.2 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased to $18.8 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.9 million.\n  * Cash flow from operations of $23.6 million, compared to cash flow from operations of ($4.1) million.\n  * Ended the quarter with $82.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 36% from $60.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook:**\n\n  * Revenue of $131.0 - $136.0 million, representing 140% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\n  * Variable Marketing Margin of $38.0 - $40.0 million, representing 89% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $14.0 - $16.0 million, versus a loss of ($0.9) million in the prior year’s period.\n\n\n\nWith respect to the Company’s expectations under “Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook” above, the Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP measure net income (loss) in this press release because the Company does not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, interest income, and income taxes on a consistent basis as the Company is unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts, which would be required to include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss). In addition, the Company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nEverQuote will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, November 4, 2024.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “might,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “seek,” “would” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) from time to time. Additional information will also be set forth in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, which will be filed with the SEC. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (1) our dependence on revenue from the property and casualty insurance industries, and specifically automotive insurance, and exposure to risks related to those industries; (2) our dependence on our relationships with insurance providers with no long-term minimum financial commitments; (3) our reliance on a small number of insurance providers for a significant portion of our revenue; (4) our dependence on third-party media sources for a significant portion of visitors to our websites and marketplace; (5) our ability to attract consumers searching for insurance to our websites and marketplace through Internet search engines, display advertising, social media, content-based online advertising and other online sources; (6) any limitations restricting our ability to market to users or collect and use data derived from user activities; (7) risks related to cybersecurity incidents or other network disruptions; (8) risks related to the use of artificial intelligence; (9) our ability to develop new and enhanced products and services to attract and retain consumers and insurance providers, and to successfully monetize them; (10) the impact of competition in our industry and innovation by our competitors; (11) our ability to hire and retain necessary qualified employees to expand our operations; (12) our ability to stay abreast of and comply with new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business, including with respect to the insurance industry, telemarketing restrictions and data privacy requirements; (13) our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and maintain and build our brand; (14) our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, variable marketing margin, operating expenses, cash flows and ability to achieve, and maintain, future profitability; (15) our ability to properly collect, process, store, share, disclose and use consumer information and other data; and (16) the future trading prices of our Class A common stock.\n\n**About EverQuote**\n\nEverQuote operates a leading online insurance marketplace, connecting consumers with insurance providers.

\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please see “EverQuote, Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP” below for more information.  \n  \nTo supplement the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding EverQuote’s financial results, the Company has presented Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization expense; restructuring and other charges; acquisition-related costs; interest income; and income taxes. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The Company monitors and presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing EverQuote’s business. In particular, the Company believes that excluding the impact of these items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of EverQuote’s core operating performance.\n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate EverQuote’s operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in EverQuote’s business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes in the calculations of Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, the Company believes that this financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EverQuote’s operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.\n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, which could reduce the usefulness of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEVERQUOTE, INC.  \n---  \nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n(in thousands)  \nNet income (loss)| $| 11,554| $| (29,217| )| $| 19,863| $| (44,939| )  \nStock-based compensation| 5,446| 5,479| 15,304| 17,995  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,618| 2,251| 4,117| 5,121  \nRestructuring and other charges| —| 19,757| —| 23,589  \nAcquisition-related costs| —| —| —| (150| )  \nInterest income| (554| )| (411| )| (1,396| )| (869| )  \nIncome tax expense| 719| 236| 1,411| 600  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 18,783| $| (1,905| )| $| 39,299| $| 1,347  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NzAwNyM2NTYzOTY3IzIxMjIyMTI=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDdlZTU1MmYtMDI5ZS00YmQyLThlODQtYjFmNWVlZWUwYTVlLTExMzM3ODM=/tiny/EverQuote-Inc.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/86005bfc-f760-4c2f-9bfc-d896152a9bea/small/everquote-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/86005bfc-f760-4c2f-9bfc-d896152a9bea)\n\nSource: EverQuote, Inc.\n\n[View All News](http://investors.everquote.com/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [Home](http://investors.everquote.com/home/default.aspx)\n  * [Site Map](http://investors.everquote.com/site-map/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## Email Alerts\n\nTo receive notifications via email, enter your email address and select at least one subscription below.
