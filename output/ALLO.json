(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced that it will present pre-clinical data for its next-generation investigational AlloCAR T candidate for autoimmune indications, ALLO-329, at the American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting, ACR Convergence 2024, being held from November 14-19 in Washington, D.C.\n\nALLO-329, the Company’s CD19/CD70 dual AlloCAR T product is the first CAR T designed to both reduce or eliminate the need for lymphodepletion while also targeting CD19+ B-cells and CD70+ activated T-cells, both of which are likely to play a role in autoimmune diseases. ALLO-329 utilizes CRISPR-based site-specific integration for dual CAR expression.\n\n“We are at the beginning of understanding what may be possible for CAR T in autoimmune disease. However, the only way to fully realize the potential of the modality is to develop product candidates designed to meet the specific needs of this vast patient population and allow for greater implementation in real-world practice. This is how we have designed ALLO-329,” said Zachary Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research & Development of Allogene. “We believe the first and most important factor for the potential success of CAR T in autoimmune disease is being available off-the-shelf to meet potential demand. Next, we have addressed lymphodepletion by incorporating our proprietary and clinically validated Dagger® technology, which is designed to enable cells to expand and persist in patients without or with potentially reduced chemotherapy conditioning. Lastly, our dual CAR targets both the B- and T-cell components of autoimmune disease, which we believe may allow for a broader application of CAR T across a multitude of indications.”\n\nAllogene Abstract: Title: Preclinical Evaluation of ALLO-329: Allogeneic CD19 CAR T Cells Expressing an Anti-Rejection CD70 CAR for the Treatment of Autoimmune DiseasesPresenter: Kristen Zhang, Research Scientist, Allogene TherapeuticsAbstract Number: 1841Poster Session: T Cell Biology & Targets in Autoimmune & Inflammatory Disease PosterDate and Time: Monday, November 18, 10:30 a.m-12:30 p.m. ET\n\nThe abstract can be found on the American College of Rheumatology’s [website.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fi3hloGeqmB2lr4tDEONWTZHbQifwZuwIUCXj63kAcVrjqXxvjX1CWQitbqYtEcAcPWluD8McnMIV17TofZdcAJAB42PwEF4pZHQRJi5mmDiUDZoiVUqEpS0W8bddr2gq9OzipkqEWcZuohvOISwzfu19CAdYaEDhkdna4pJr_swKzN_VtvwAHT_9C9D6lEQdMMYBFzb5NrkypBXm2LziJRVt4rpMokFlEF9GdZzY7bZyqvvjglCgidEGmWGQoq08n6bk9SRikv805lSAa2OiA==)\n\nThe Company plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter of 2025 and expects to have proof-of-concept by year-end 2025.\n\n**About Allogene Therapeutics** Allogene Therapeutics, with headquarters in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease.

(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced preclinical data for ALLO-329, an investigational allogeneic CD19/CD70 dual CAR T cell therapy being evaluated as a treatment for autoimmune diseases. The data, presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024, demonstrate the potential of ALLO-329 to specifically address key challenges associated with current autologous CAR T cell therapies in development for patients with autoimmune disease and highlights the promise of an allogeneic CAR T to reset the immune system.\n\nALLO-329 is the first CAR T designed to target both CD19+ B-cells and CD70+ activated T cells. Targeting of B cells has been shown to induce durable, treatment-free remissions in patients with certain autoimmune diseases. CD70 is expressed in activated T cells, which have been implicated in immune responses, including in autoimmunity. Simultaneous elimination of CD70+ T cells may enhance the therapeutic benefit and expand the list of addressable indications.\n\nCD70+ activated T cells also include alloreactive T-cells – the patient’s cells that would attack and reject an allogeneic CAR-T. ALLO-329 is designed to effectively eliminate alloreactive T-cells and render ALLO-329 resistant to rejection. Incorporation of Dagger® technology into ALLO-329 is intended to reduce or eliminate lymphodepletion prior to cell infusion.\n\n“The CAR T space for autoimmune disease is highly competitive, with many approaches focusing only on isolated aspects of autoimmune pathogenesis,” said Zachary Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., EVP, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Allogene. “What sets ALLO-329 apart is its ability to target a greater spectrum of immune dysfunction, addressing both B cells and activated T-cells involved in the disease process, potentially improving disease outcomes with reduced or even no lymphodepletion. Coupled with its “off-the-shelf” accessibility, ALLO-329 has the potential to meet the substantial needs of a broad patient population. These preclinical findings reinforce our excitement as we move this therapy toward clinical development across multiple autoimmune conditions.”\n\nKey findings from the preclinical evaluation of ALLO-329 include:\n\n  * High CAR expression and cytotoxic activity: ALLO-329 produced through site-specific integration of a dual CAR construct into the TRAC locus demonstrated robust CAR expression and specific cytotoxic activity against both CD19+ B cells and CD70+ T cells _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.\n  * Resistance to rejection: In mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays, ALLO-329 successfully eliminated CD70+ alloreactive T cells, demonstrating resistance to rejection and enhanced persistence compared to CD19 CAR T cells.\n  * B cell depletion and antibody reduction: ALLO-329 effectively eradicated B cells derived from healthy donors and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ , leading to a reduction in IgG and IgM production.\n  * Potential to eliminate lymphodepletion: In humanized pre-clinical models, ALLO-329 demonstrated engraftment, B cell depletion, and expansion even without lymphodepletion.\n  * Manufacturability: CRISPR-mediated, T-cell receptor alpha (_TRAC_) site-specific transgene integration leads to a highly consistent, dual CAR T-expressing product.\n\n\n\nBased on these promising preclinical results, the Company plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025 and expects to have proof-of-concept by year-end 2025.\n\n**About ALLO-329** ALLO-329 is a CD19/CD70 dual AlloCAR T™ investigational product being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. ALLO-329 utilizes CRISPR-based site-specific integration for dual CAR expression. This approach targets both CD19+ B cells and CD70+ T cells, which play a role in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Additionally, ALLO-329 incorporates Allogene's clinically validated Dagger® technology, designed to reduce or eliminate the need for lymphodepletion, a pre-treatment regimen that may be a significant barrier to CAR T cell therapy adoption in autoimmune indications.\n\n**About Allogene Therapeutics**Allogene Therapeutics, with headquarters in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease.

(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today provided corporate updates and reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are proud of the progress made in the third quarter of 2024 to advance our investigational allogeneic cell products in key “firsts” – our first-line consolidation trial in large B-cell lymphoma with cema-cel, ALLO-316 as the first allogeneic CAR T product candidate to demonstrate positive results in solid tumors, and the first CD19/CD70 dual CAR T candidate specifically designed for autoimmune disease,” said David Chang, M.D., Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Allogene. “We believe these efforts have the potential to redefine treatment paradigms, tailoring therapies to meet the unique needs of large patient populations, and enabling broader real-world adoption. Allogene remains dedicated to driving innovation that improves outcomes for patients with both cancer and autoimmune diseases.”\n\n**Program Updates**\n\n**Cema-Cel: Pivotal ALPHA3 1L Consolidation Trial in Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL)** The pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA3 trial is the main focus for the Company. The trial was initiated in June 2024 and now has almost 30 sites activated and screening for patients with minimal residual disease (MRD).\n\nThis groundbreaking study is evaluating the use of cemacabtagene ansegedleucel (cema-cel) as part of the first line (1L) treatment regimen for patients with LBCL who are likely to relapse after standard 1L treatment. ALPHA3 is the first pivotal trial to offer CAR T as part of 1L treatment consolidation.\n\nThis innovative ALPHA3 trial will identify patients at high risk for relapse after 1L treatment by utilizing Foresight CLARITY™ powered by PhasED-Seq™, a novel and highly accurate Investigational Use Only (IUO) test for MRD. This randomized trial will enroll approximately 240 patients and is designed to demonstrate a meaningful improvement in event free survival (EFS) in patients treated with cema-cel relative to patients who receive the current standard of care (observation). ALPHA3 is expected to complete enrollment in 1H 2026. Efficacy analyses are expected to occur in 2026 and will include an interim EFS analysis monitored by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in 1H 2026 and the data readout of the primary EFS analysis by YE 2026. A potential biologics license application (BLA) submission is targeted for 2027.\n\n**ALLO-329: CD19/CD70 Dual CAR with Dagger****®****Technology in Autoimmune Disease (AID)** The Company will present pre-clinical data for its next-generation investigational AlloCAR T candidate for autoimmune indications, ALLO-329, at the American College of Rheumatology’s annual meeting, ACR Convergence 2024, November 18, 2024, in Washington, D.C.\n\nALLO-329 offers a novel approach to treating autoimmune diseases as the first allogeneic CD19/CD70 dual CAR T product specifically designed to target CD19+ B-cells and CD70+ activated T-cells, both of which are key players in autoimmune diseases. The investigational product utilizes CRISPR-based site-specific integration and incorporates the Company’s clinically validated Dagger technology, which aims to reduce or eliminate the need for lymphodepletion, believed to be a potentially significant obstacle to the wider adoption of CAR T therapies in autoimmune applications.\n\nThe Company plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application in Q1 2025 and expects to have proof-of-concept by YE 2025.\n\n**ALLO-316: TRAVERSE Trial in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)** The Company will present an update to the ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial in an oral presentation at the 2024 International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS, November 8, 2024) and at a poster session at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) Annual Meeting (November 9, 2024). The trial evaluates ALLO-316, the Company’s first AlloCAR T product candidate for the treatment of solid tumors. The Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGF-targeting therapy. These presentations highlight strong evidence of anti-tumor activity of ALLO-316 following standard FC (fludarabine (30 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2)) lymphodepletion in patients with CD70 positive RCC tumors.\n\nAs of the October 14, 2024 data cutoff, 39 patients had been enrolled in the ongoing Phase 1 trial, of which 26 were confirmed to have CD70 positive RCC and were evaluable for efficacy outcomes. The median time from enrollment to the start of therapy was five days. Data from dose escalation cohorts as well as a newly opened Phase 1b expansion cohort are included in the presentations. The Phase 1b expansion cohort is evaluating safety and efficacy of ALLO-316 at DL2 (80M CAR T cells) following a standard FC lymphodepletion.\n\nFollowing a single infusion of ALLO-316 in heavily pretreated patients, the trial demonstrated best Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 50% and Confirmed Response Rate of 33% in those patients with CD70 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50% who received the Phase 1b expansion regimen. Patients with a TPS of ≥50% comprise the majority of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. Of those with a TPS ≥50, 76% (16/21) experienced a reduction in tumor burden. Two of six (33%) patients with high TPS who received the Phase 1b expansion regimen showed durable responses ongoing at ≥4 months.\n\nThe most common all-grade adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (with only one grade ≥3), fatigue (59%), neutropenia (56%), decreased white blood cell count (54%), anemia (51%), and nausea (51%). Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was minimal at 8% and no graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) occurred.\n\nTwo dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events of autoimmune hepatitis and cardiogenic shock were reported. Each event occurred in two separate participants who received FCA (FC plus ALLO-647) lymphodepletion and DL2 of ALLO-316. Three Grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were reported: 1) cardiogenic shock, which was one of the two DLT events; 2) sepsis from multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a participant who received DL4 of ALLO-316 - this participant had a prior episode of muscle abscess and bacteremia from the same multi-drug resistant Klebsiella and was receiving anakinra and dexamethasone for hyperinflammation; and 3) failure to thrive in a participant 16 months after treatment with ALLO-316 - this subject had tumor response of stable disease (SD) at month 12 and no interval scans to evaluate disease status prior to death.\n\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company announced that it had received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for ALLO-316 for adult patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. The RMAT designation was based on Phase 1 clinical data from the TRAVERSE trial indicating the potential of ALLO-316 to address the unmet need for patients with difficult-to-treat RCC who have failed multiple standard RCC therapies, including an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy.\n\n**2024 Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expenses were $44.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, which includes $5.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $16.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, which includes $7.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n  * Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $66.3 million, or $0.32 per share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $13.4 million and $10.7 million in non-cash impairment of long-lived asset expense.\n  * The Company had $403.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\nBased on its cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to expect its cash runway to fund operations into the second half of 2026. Guidance remains unchanged from the most recent update with an expectation of a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments of approximately $200 million in 2024. GAAP Operating Expenses are expected to be approximately $300 million, including estimated non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $60 million. These estimates exclude any impact from potential business development activities.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details** Allogene will host a live conference call and webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial results and provide a business update.

(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, will concurrently present new data from the Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial in an oral presentation at the 2024 International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS) and a poster session at The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) Annual Meeting. The trial evaluates ALLO-316, the Company’s first AlloCAR T product candidate for the potential treatment of solid tumors. The ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGF-targeting therapy. These presentations highlight compelling evidence of CAR T activity and anti-tumor efficacy in 26 patients with RCC tumors known to be CD70 positive who were evaluable for efficacy outcomes.\n\n“ALLO-316, the leading “off-the-shelf” CAR T product candidate currently in development for solid tumors, continues to show remarkable potency in the TRAVERSE trial. Data from the Phase 1 study demonstrating significant anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic disease resistant to multiple therapeutic classes, even with standard lymphodepletion, potentially marks a major advancement in the field,” said Zachary Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., EVP, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Allogene. “The unprecedented cell expansion and persistence driven by CD70 CAR-intrinsic Dagger® technology, along with strong evidence of tumor infiltration by CAR T cells, highlights the distinctive features of ALLO-316. We believe these findings from our Phase 1 trial lay the groundwork for a new generation of allogeneic cell therapies.”\n\nAs of the October 14, 2024 data cutoff, 39 patients had been enrolled in the ongoing Phase 1 trial, of which 26 were confirmed to have CD70 positive RCC and were evaluable for efficacy outcomes. The median time from enrollment to the start of therapy was five days. Data from dose escalation cohorts and ongoing Phase 1b expansion cohort are included in the presentations. The Phase 1b expansion cohort is evaluating safety and efficacy of ALLO-316 at DL2 (80M CAR T cells) following a standard FC500 (fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/d) for 3 days) lymphodepletion regimen. The Phase 1b expansion cohort is expected to ultimately include approximately 20 patients. Additional data from the Phase 1b expansion cohort is expected to be announced in mid-2025.\n\nFollowing a single infusion of ALLO-316 in heavily pretreated patients, the trial demonstrated best Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 50% and Confirmed Response Rate of 33% in those patients with CD70 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50% who received DL2. Patients with a TPS of ≥50% comprise the majority of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. Of those with a TPS ≥50, 76% (16/21) experienced a reduction in tumor burden. Two of six (33%) patients with high TPS who received the Phase 1b expansion regimen showed durable responses ongoing at ≥4 months.\n\nResponse Rates by CD70 Status and Dose\n\nPatients Evaluable for Disease Outcomesa (N=34)  \n---  \nCD70 Positive (N=26) | CD70 Negative or Unknown (N=8)  \nAll(N=26) | FCAb(N=8) | FCc(N=18) | DL2 FC500 (Phase 1b)(N=8)  \nBest overall response,d n/N (%) High TPS (≥50) Low TPS (<50) | 7/26 (27)7/21 (33)0/5 (0) | 1/8 (13)1/6 (17)0/2 (0) | 6/18 (33)6/15 (40)0/3 (0) | 3/8 (38)3/6 (50)0/2 (0) | 0/8 (0)NANA  \nConfirmed ORR,e n/N (%) High TPS (≥50) Low TPS (<50) | 5/26 (19)5/21 (24)0/5 (0) | 1/8 (13)1/6 (17)0/2 (0) | 4/18 (22)4/15 (27)0/3 (0) | 2/8 (25)2/6 (33)0/2 (0) | 0/8 (0)NANA  \n  \naPatients evaluable for disease outcome includes those who received ALLO-316 and had at least one tumor assessment. bStandard fludarabine and cyclophosphamide plus ALLO-647cIncludes FC300 and FC500dBest overall response across visits did not require confirmation for CR/PR. eConfirmed overall response of CR/PR required confirmation at the subsequent visit.\n\nThe most common all-grade adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (with only one grade ≥3), fatigue (59%), neutropenia (56%), decreased white blood cell count (54%), anemia (51%) and nausea (51%).

IEC-HS includes the preferred terms IEC-HS, HLH, Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and atypical HLH. Two patients developed an inflammatory syndrome prior to the existence of IEC-HS as a term in MedDRA, which has been updated as of September 2023.aInfection events (62%) were primarily low grade; the most common was viral infections (33%) with cytomegalovirus infection and COVID-19 (any grade, 18% and 15%; Grade ≥3, 0% and 5%, respectively). bNeurotoxicity includes system organ class of nerve system disorders and psychiatric disorders with onset date up to Study Day 30 post ALLO-316 infusion.\n\nTwo DLT events of autoimmune hepatitis and cardiogenic shock were reported. Each event occurred in 2 separate participants who received FCA (FC300 plus ALLO-647) lymphodepletion and DL2 of ALLO-316. Three Grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were reported: 1) cardiogenic shock, which was one of the 2 DLT events; 2) sepsis from multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a participant who received DL4 of ALLO-316. This participant had a prior episode of muscle abscess and bacteremia from the same multi-drug resistant Klebsiella and was receiving anakinra and dexamethasone for hyperinflammation; 3) failure to thrive in a participant 16 months after treatment with ALLO-316. This subject had tumor response of stable disease (SD) at month 12 and no interval scans to evaluate disease status prior to death.\n\n**About ALLO-316 (TRAVERSE)** ALLO-316 is an AlloCAR T™ investigational product targeting CD70, which is highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). CD70 is also selectively expressed in several cancers, creating the potential for ALLO-316 to be developed across a variety of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell RCC. In October 2024 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation based on the potential of ALLO-316 to address the unmet need for patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA previously granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to ALLO-316 in March 2023. In April 2024, the Company announced a $15 million award from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the ongoing TRAVERSE trial with ALLO-316 in RCC.\n\n**About Allogene Therapeutics**Allogene Therapeutics, with headquarters in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease.

(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced that it will present new data from the ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial at the 2024 International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS) and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) annual meeting. The trial evaluates ALLO-316, the Company’s first AlloCAR T product candidate for the potential treatment of solid tumors. These presentations will highlight data from 26 heavily pretreated patients with CD70 positive renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and will include details on the diagnostic and treatment algorithm used to mitigate treatment-associated hyperinflammatory response seen in some patients. The ongoing Phase 1 data supported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) October 2024 decision to grant Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for ALLO-316 based on clinical data from the TRAVERSE trial indicating its to address the unmet need for adult patients with advanced or metastatic CD70 positive RCC who have failed multiple standard RCC therapies, including an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy. \n\n“We are looking forward to presenting the most recent Phase 1 data from our ongoing TRAVERSE trial at both SITC and IKCS,” said Zachary Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., EVP of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer. “There is significant unmet need for these heavily pretreated patients with advanced RCC. In treating their disease, these patients rarely get any form of treatment break as their disease quickly progresses. This data highlights the potential of ALLO-316 to elicit a response from a single infusion, suggesting a breakthrough in allogeneic CAR T therapy for solid tumors. As the Phase 1 data matures, we plan to seek FDA’s input for the next stage of clinical development.”\n\n**2024 International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS)****Title** : TRAVERSE: Updated safety and efficacy of ALLO-316 in advanced/metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)**Presenter:** Ritesh Kotecha, M.D., Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center **Session Date and Time** : Friday, November 8, 11:50 a.m. ET\n\n**The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) Annual Meeting** **Title** : ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): Updated safety and efficacy from the phase 1 TRAVERSE multicenter study**Presenter** : Samer Srour, M.D., The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center**Abstract Numbe** r: 322**Date and Time:** Saturday, November 9, 12:15-1:45 p.m. CT, 7:00-8:30 p.m. CT\n\nThe ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC.

(Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-316 for the treatment of adult patients with CD70 positive advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The RMAT designation was based on clinical data from the TRAVERSE trial indicating the potential of ALLO-316 to address the unmet need for patients with difficult-to-treat RCC who have failed multiple standard RCC therapies, including an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy. The ongoing development of ALLO-316 continues to advance the scientific understanding and applicability of the Dagger® technology as the next-generation allogeneic platform to maximize the potential of a single infusion of “off-the-shelf” CAR T product in solid tumors.\n\n“The RMAT designation for ALLO-316 highlights the transformative potential of our AlloCAR T™ platform to offer new hope for heavily pretreated patients with renal cell carcinoma who have exhausted standard treatment options,” said Zachary Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer. “This important milestone moves us closer to fulfilling the promise of “off-the-shelf” CAR T therapy—delivering faster, more reliable, and widely accessible treatments. We remain optimistic about the future of ALLO-316 and its potential to be an important advancement for patients.”\n\nThe ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. Initial results from the TRAVERSE trial were presented in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida, in 2023. The Company will present updated Phase 1 data from the TRAVERSE trial at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) annual meeting.\n\nThe RMAT designation is intended to accelerate the development and review of promising investigational products, including cell therapies. To qualify, a product must be designed to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease, with preliminary clinical evidence suggesting it can address unmet medical needs. The RMAT designation offers several key advantages, including early and frequent interactions with the FDA to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints, as well as strategies to meet post-approval requirements, potentially streamlining the path to market approval.\n\n**About ALLO-316 (TRAVERSE)** ALLO-316, an AlloCAR T™ investigational product, targets CD70 which is highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). CD70 is also selectively expressed in several cancers, creating the potential for ALLO-316 to be developed across a variety of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. ALLO-316 utilizes the Dagger® technology to optimize CAR T cell expansion and persistence to maximize the potential efficacy in solid tumors with a one-time infusion. The ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell RCC. In March 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to ALLO-316, and in October 2024 the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-316 based on its potential to address the unmet need for adult patients with CD70 positive advanced or metastatic RCC who have failed standard RCC therapies.\n\n**About Allogene Therapeutics**Allogene Therapeutics, with headquarters in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease.

Various factors may cause material differences between Allogene’s expectations and actual results, including, risks and uncertainties related to: RMAT designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval and the designation can be revoked if the criteria for eligibility ceases to be met; our product candidates are based on novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and obtaining regulatory approval; the limited nature of our Phase 1 data from our clinical trials and the extent to which such data may or may not be validated in any future clinical trial; our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential; the extent to which the Food and Drug Administration disagrees with our clinical or regulatory plans or the import of our clinical results, which could cause future delays to our clinical trials, including initiation of clinical trials, or require additional clinical trials; we may encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials; we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization; and our ability to obtain additional financing to develop our products and implement our operating plans. These and other risks are discussed in greater detail in Allogene’s filings with the SEC, including without limitation under the “Risk Factors” heading in its Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024. Any forward-looking statements that are made in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Allogene assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this press release.\n\nAlloCAR T™ and Dagger® are trademarks of Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nAllogene’s investigational AlloCAR T™ oncology products utilize Cellectis technologies.
