The expanded partnership will include funding for mental health and wellbeing programs, reinforcing LegalZoom’s commitment to creating pathways to economic opportunity for underrepresented communities that face significant challenges due to employment history, race and ethnicity, gender identity, and incarceration.\n\nWith LegalZoom’s support, Defy Ventures will be able to expand its mental health and wellbeing initiatives for its clients, focusing on trauma-informed care that addresses the unique challenges they face. By helping to fund Defy Ventures’ mental wellness programs, LegalZoom is helping to ensure that these individuals have access to crucial mental health resources, empowering them not only to build businesses but also to rebuild their lives with dignity and resilience.\n\n“Defy Ventures exemplifies the incredible power of resilience and the potential for true transformation. We are honored to extend our partnership to support their mental health initiatives, which are essential for giving people a real second chance,” said Nicole Miller, Chief Legal Officer at LegalZoom and Board Member of Defy Ventures. “Our ongoing investment in Defy Ventures’ impactful programs reflects our commitment to social equity and empowering individuals to rebuild their lives and communities.”\n\nDefy Ventures offers a range of holistic programs, including _CEO of Your New Life_ , _Entrepreneur Bootcamp_ , and _Business Accelerator_ , which equip individuals with the business and confidence-building skills they need to succeed. The mental health and wellbeing program, first launched in 2023 with funding from LegalZoom, integrates trauma-informed principles into the full suite of Defy’s programs, offering a critical layer of support for participants facing past trauma and the challenges of reintegration. These combined efforts had allowed Defy to maintain a three-year recidivism rate of less than 15%, far below the national average.\n\nIn 2025, LegalZoom will deepen its commitment to Defy Ventures’ mental health and wellbeing programs, providing $100,000 in funding to support and expand critical mental health resources. This funding will allow Defy Ventures to:\n\n  * **Revise and Enhance Curriculum:** Incorporate trauma-informed care principles into program materials to create a supportive, safe environment for all participants.\n  * **Expand Support Groups:** Offer mental health and wellbeing support groups for post-release clients, giving them a space to find peer support as they navigate reentry.\n  * **Train Staff in Trauma-Informed Care:** Equip staff with best practices in trauma-informed care through dedicated training sessions.\n  * **Provide Ongoing Technical Support:** Facilitate regular case conferences and technical support to deepen staff expertise on mental health and wellness topics.\n\n\n\n“People with criminal histories face myriad collateral consequences after their return to society. Partners like LegalZoom are instrumental in giving them a real chance at a fresh start by supporting our whole-person programs,” said Andrew Glazier, President and CEO at Defy Ventures. “LegalZoom’s focus on expanding our mental health and wellbeing practice will be a game-changer for our clients, providing essential support as they build new skills, launch business ideas, and work toward a stable future.”\n\nSince the beginning of its partnership with Defy Ventures in 2021, LegalZoom has made a meaningful impact through funding, volunteer support, and product donations, helping Defy transform the lives of individuals re-entering society. Previous contributions from LegalZoom have enabled Defy to:\n\n  * Fund a cohort at the California Women’s Facility (2021-2022)\n  * Support post-release services, including career pathways, a 17-week Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, and Business Accelerator courses (2022-2023)\n  * Launch and expand the Mental Health and Wellbeing practice with the hiring of Dr. Yehudah Pryce, Senior Director of National Mental Health & Wellbeing Programs (2023-2024)\n\n\n\nThrough this expanded partnership, LegalZoom and Defy Ventures continue to provide a second chance for those often overlooked by society, empowering them to create meaningful change in their own lives and in their communities. Together, they are working toward a future where every individual has the tools, support, and mental resilience needed to succeed.\n\n**About LegalZoom** LegalZoom is a leading online platform for business formation in the United States.

Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our quarterly and annual guidance.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: our dependence on business formations; our dependence on customers expanding the use of our platform, including converting our transactional customers to subscribers and our subscribers renewing their subscriptions with us; the impact of macroeconomic challenges on our business, including as a result of inflation, global conflict, supply chain issues and recessionary concerns; our ability to remain profitable in the future; our ability to provide high-quality products and services, customer care and customer experience; our ability to continue to innovate and provide a platform that is useful to our customers and that meets our customers’ expectations; the competitive legal solutions market; our dependence on our brand and reputation; our ability to maintain and expand strategic relationships with third parties; our ability to hire and retain top talent and motivate our employees; risks and costs associated with complex and evolving laws and regulations; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on August 7, 2024, as well as those factors in our subsequent filings with the SEC.

These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n\nYou should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income margin, Non-GAAP net income per share and Free cash flow. To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and liquidity and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance and liquidity, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important measures used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, long-lived and other assets, legal expenses, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses and certain non-recurring income and expenses from time to time. Our Adjusted EBITDA financial measure differs from GAAP in that it excludes certain items of income and expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary performance measures used by our management and our board of directors to understand and evaluate our financial performance and operating trends, including period-to-period comparisons, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short and long-term operational plans and determine appropriate compensation plans for our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In assessing our performance, we exclude certain expenses that we believe are not comparable period over period or that we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations include that the non-GAAP financial measure:\n\n  * may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure;\n  * does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may be replaced in the future;\n  * does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n  * excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and\n  * does not reflect certain other expenses that we do not consider representative of our underlying operating performance, but that reduce cash available to us.\n\n\n\nWe define Non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction-related expenses, and certain non-recurring income and expenses from time to time, net of related income tax impacts. Our Non-GAAP net income financial measure differs from GAAP in that it excludes certain items of income and expense. We define Net income (loss) margin as net loss as a percentage of revenue. We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) margin as Non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of revenue. We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders as Non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic and diluted weighted-average common stock. We believe Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders are operating performance measures that provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business.\n\nFree cash flow is a liquidity measure used by management in evaluating the cash generated by our operations after purchases of property and equipment including capitalized internal-use software. We consider Free cash flow to be an important measure because it provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. The usefulness of Free cash flow as an analytical tool has limitations because it excludes certain items that are settled in cash, does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses, does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash used in or provided by operating activities.\n\nWe are not providing a reconciliation for our non-GAAP outlook on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Financial Guidance and Outlook” above), as we are unable to provide a meaningful calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure that have not yet occurred, are out of LegalZoom’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe tables in this press release contain more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\n**LegalZoom**\n\nLegalZoom is a leading online platform for business formation in the United States.

(Nasdaq: LZ) today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“I am pleased with the early strides we are making against our key execution priorities,” said Jeff Stibel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LegalZoom. “During the quarter, we made progress in reorienting our commercialization and sales efforts to subscription offerings and updating our pricing to better reflect the value we provide. As we focus our efforts on our core legal and compliance offerings for small businesses and consumers, our goal is to attract high-value customers who will grow alongside LegalZoom.”\n\nNoel Watson, LegalZoom’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer said, “Our strong execution drove third quarter results at or above the high-end of our outlook. We achieved a 28% Adjusted EBITDA margin driven by a higher mix of subscription revenue as well as lower expenses related to testing initiatives and our restructuring efforts. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive efficient growth and operational improvements while driving durable margin expansion over time.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $168.6 million for the quarter, up 1% year-over-year: \n    * Transaction units increased 8% year-over-year; transaction revenue of $57.9 million decreased 7% year-over-year.\n    * Subscription units increased 10% year-over-year; subscription revenue of $110.7 million grew 5% year-over-year.\n  * Net income was $11.1 million for the quarter, or 7% of revenue, compared to net income of $7.5 million, or 5% of revenue, for the same period in 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $29.7 million for the quarter compared to Non-GAAP net income of $23.3 million in the same period in 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $47.1 million for the quarter, or 28% of revenue, compared to $33.7 million, or 20% of revenue, for the same period in 2023.\n  * Cash flow provided by operating activities was $31.6 million for the quarter compared to $27.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Free cash flow was $22.0 million for the quarter compared to $19.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $24.7 million, at an average price of $6.56 per share.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $112.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $225.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024** **Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n_(unaudited, in thousands except AOV, ARPU and percentages)_\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **% Growth**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**| **% Growth**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Decline)**| **(Decline)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **YOY**| **2024**| **2023**| **YOY**  \nTotal revenue| $| 168,599| $| 167,274| 1| %| $| 520,175| $| 502,064| 4| %  \nTransaction revenue| $| 57,879| $| 61,967| (7| %)| $| 192,733| $| 195,857| (2| %)  \nSubscription revenue| $| 110,720| $| 105,307| 5| %| $| 327,442| $| 306,207| 7| %  \nGross profit| $| 113,884| $| 108,061| 5| %| $| 333,467| $| 318,708| 5| %  \nGross margin| 68| %| 65| %| 5| %| 64| %| 63| %| 2| %  \nNet Income| $| 11,051| $| 7,534| 47| %| $| 17,109| $| 6,571| 160| %  \nNet income margin| 7| %| 5| %| 40| %| 3| %| 1| %| 200| %  \nNet Income per share — basic:| $| 0.06| $| 0.04| 50| %| $| 0.09| $| 0.03| 200| %  \nNet Income per share — diluted:| $| 0.06| $| 0.04| 50| %| $| 0.09| $| 0.03| 200| %  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 31,613| $| 27,441| 15| %| $| 93,053| $| 101,814| (9| %)  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \nNon GAAP net income| $| 29,699| $| 23,308| 27| %| $| 66,853| $| 56,341| 19| %  \nNon GAAP net income per share — basic:| $| 0.17| $| 0.12| 42| %| $| 0.37| $| 0.29| 28| %  \nNon GAAP net income per share — diluted:| $| 0.17| $| 0.12| 42| %| $| 0.36| $| 0.29| 24| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 47,096| $| 33,740| 40| %| $| 103,910| $| 85,253| 22| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 28| %| 20| %| 40| %| 20| %| 17| %| 18| %  \nFree cash flow| $| 21,975| $| 19,448| 13| %| $| 64,064| $| 78,594| (18| %)  \n**Key Business Metrics**  \nTransaction units| 255| 237| 8| %| 883| 828| 7| %  \nBusiness formations| 113| 137| (18| %)| 386| 468| (18| %)  \nAverage order value (AOV)| $| 227| $| 262| (13| %)| $| 218| $| 236| (8| %)  \nSubscription units at period end| 1,717| 1,568| 10| %| 1,717| 1,568| 10| %  \nAverage revenue per subscription unit (ARPU) at period end| $| 264| $| 267| (1| %)| $| 264| $| 267| (1| %)  \n_Certain percentages may not recalculate due to rounding._  \n  \n**Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024, LegalZoom currently expects:\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $158 million to $162 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $44 million\n\n\n\nLegalZoom has updated its full-year financial outlook to reflect three quarters of financial results as well as the Company’s latest expectations for Census EIN application trends and current business initiatives.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release may be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our quarterly and annual guidance.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: our dependence on business formations; our dependence on customers expanding the use of our platform, including converting our transactional customers to subscribers and our subscribers renewing their subscriptions with us; the impact of macroeconomic challenges on our business, including as a result of inflation, global conflict, supply chain issues and recessionary concerns; our ability to remain profitable in the future; our ability to provide high-quality products and services, customer care and customer experience; our ability to continue to innovate and provide a platform that is useful to our customers and that meets our customers’ expectations; the competitive legal solutions market; our dependence on our brand and reputation; our ability to maintain and expand strategic relationships with third parties; our ability to hire and retain top talent and motivate our employees; risks and costs associated with complex and evolving laws and regulations; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on August 7, 2024, as well as those factors in our subsequent filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date of this press release, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n\nYou should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income margin, Non-GAAP net income per share and Free cash flow. To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and liquidity and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance and liquidity, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important measures used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, long-lived and other assets, legal expenses, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses and certain non-recurring income and expenses from time to time. Our Adjusted EBITDA financial measure differs from GAAP in that it excludes certain items of income and expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary performance measures used by our management and our board of directors to understand and evaluate our financial performance and operating trends, including period-to-period comparisons, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short and long-term operational plans and determine appropriate compensation plans for our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In assessing our performance, we exclude certain expenses that we believe are not comparable period over period or that we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations include that the non-GAAP financial measure:\n\n  * may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure;\n  * does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may be replaced in the future;\n  * does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n  * excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and\n  * does not reflect certain other expenses that we do not consider representative of our underlying operating performance, but that reduce cash available to us.\n\n\n\nWe define Non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction-related expenses, and certain non-recurring income and expenses from time to time, net of related income tax impacts. Our Non-GAAP net income financial measure differs from GAAP in that it excludes certain items of income and expense. We define Net income (loss) margin as net loss as a percentage of revenue. We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) margin as Non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of revenue. We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders as Non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic and diluted weighted-average common stock. We believe Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders are operating performance measures that provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business.\n\nFree cash flow is a liquidity measure used by management in evaluating the cash generated by our operations after purchases of property and equipment including capitalized internal-use software. We consider Free cash flow to be an important measure because it provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. The usefulness of Free cash flow as an analytical tool has limitations because it excludes certain items that are settled in cash, does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses, does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash used in or provided by operating activities.\n\nWe are not providing a reconciliation for our non-GAAP outlook on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Financial Guidance and Outlook” above), as we are unable to provide a meaningful calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure that have not yet occurred, are out of LegalZoom’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe tables in this press release contain more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\n**LegalZoom**\n\nLegalZoom is a leading online platform for business formation in the United States.
