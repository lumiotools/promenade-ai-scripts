Enters into Agreement to Make Pivotal Acquisition\")\n\nTAMPA, Fla., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ: LMFA) (“LM Funding” or the “Company”), a cryptocurrency mining and technology-based specialty finance company, is pleased to announce the signing of an asset purchase agreement to acquire the business assets of a 15 MW mining site in Oklahoma from Tech Infrastructure JV I LLC (“JV”), a joint venture majority-owned by Arthur Inc., for $7.3 million. The Company currently operates 10 MW of machines actively mining Bitcoin (BTC) at this site.\n\nBruce Rodgers, Chief Executive Officer of LM Funding, stated, “This acquisition is a pivotal first step in our strategic initiative to become a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining operation. The 15 MW hosting site enables us to transition our miners from Core to a cost-effective facility. As part of our expansion strategy, we intend to continue identifying additional hosting sites to drive further growth for our business. The Company expects to close this acquisition in December 2024.”\n\nThe acquisition includes most of the business assets of the JV, which includes air-cooled GIGA containers, transformers, and related infrastructure. Upon closing, LM Funding will pay approximately $1.1 million and apply previously extended loans to the JV, totaling approximately $3.7 million in accrued principal and interest, as a credit towards the purchase price. The remaining $2.5 million will be held in escrow to ensure the timely completion of this acquisition, including the exit of a third-party miner currently hosted by the JV. At the signing of the asset purchase agreement, the Company lent an additional $0.7 million to JV, which resulted in aggregate loans totaling $3.7 million by the Company to the JV. The facility and assets are being acquired by LM Funding for its own internal hosting needs and not for the purpose hosting third-party mining machines.\n\nArthur Inc. emphasized the strategic importance of the transaction, noting that the proceeds will be reinvested directly into its subsidiary growth strategy, focusing on the development of new mining sites and the expansion of its operational capacity. “This transaction represents a pivotal step in our long-term vision. By reinvesting the proceeds, we are positioning to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the mining sector, driving innovation and scaling our operations to meet growing demand.” said Rudá Pellini, President of Arthur Inc.\n\nNot later than January 2025, LM Funding plans to vacate the third-party miner currently hosted at the site from 5 MW of Arthur Mining’s current hosting space, paving the way for the deployment of approximately 800 of LM Funding’s S21 and XP Bitmain machines and 640 S19J Pros. The escrow is expected to be paid not later than January 2025 once all third-party miners are removed from the site and certain other closing conditions are met.\n\nThis strategic move underscores LM Funding's commitment to optimizing its operations and solidifying its leadership in the evolving cryptocurrency mining sector.\n\n**About LM Funding America**\n\nLM Funding America, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMFA), together with its subsidiaries, is a cryptocurrency mining business that commenced Bitcoin mining operations in September 2022.
