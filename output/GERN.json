          "content": "Enhancing the\nLives of Patients with\nHematologic Malignancies\nCorporate Presentation\nNovember 2024\nForward-Looking Statements and Safe Harbor\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, this presentation contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that\nsuch statements, include, without limitation, those regarding: (i) the Company’s views, estimates and expectations concerning the commercial launch of RYTELO; (ii) the potential impact on clinical decision-making, prescriber behavior and\nreimbursement decisions of the inclusion of RYTELO in the NCCN Guidelines as a Category 1 and 2A treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with lower-risk MDS; (iii) the Company’s belief that RYTELO can become part of the standard-of-\ncare for eligible LR-MDS patients; (iv) the potential for RYTELO to offer a totality of clinical benefit across LR-MDS patients irrespective of ring sideroblast status or high transfusion burden, including sustained and durable transfusion\nindependence and increases in hemoglobin levels, all within a well-characterized safety profile of generally manageable cytopenias; (v) the expected timing for completion of the MAA review and potential approval of RYTELO in transfusion-\ndependent (TD) LR-MDS; (vi) that the Phase 3 IMpactMF trial has registrational intent and that an interim analysis is expected in early 2026 and a final analysis is expected in early 2027, together with the assumptions used in making these\nestimates; (vii) the status, plans and expected timing of the Company’s clinical programs on its pipeline chart; (viii) that RYTELO offers a compelling value proposition for stakeholders; (ix) that RYTELO has showed unprecedented durability of\ntransfusion independence across multiple LR-MDS patient subgroups that are not addressed by currently available products, and is differentiated in the marketplace; (x) that there are unmet needs in TD LR-MDS and R/R MF potentially\naddressed with RYTELO treatment; (xi) the Company’s assumptions and expectations regarding the expected opportunity for RYTELO in R/R MF; (xii) the Company’s projections of operating expenses and the sufficiency of its cash and\navailable resources to fund its projected operating requirements, along with the underlying assumptions; (xiii) the expected length of regulatory, market and patent exclusivity; (xiv) any projections of revenue, patient populations, commercial\nopportunity and similar forecasts, along with the underlying assumptions; and (xv) other statements that are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that\ncan cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to: (a) whether Geron is successful in commercializing\nRYTELO (imetelstat) for the treatment of certain patients with LR-MDS with transfusion dependent anemia; (b) whether the European Commission will approve RYTELO for the treatment of patients with LR-MDS with transfusion dependent\nanemia and whether the FDA and European Commission will approve imetelstat for other indications on the timelines expected, or at all; (c) whether Geron overcomes potential delays and other adverse impacts caused by enrollment,\nclinical, safety, efficacy, technical, scientific, intellectual property, manufacturing and regulatory challenges in order to have the financial resources for and meet expected timelines and planned milestones; (d) whether regulatory authorities\npermit the further development of imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all, without any clinical holds; (e) whether RYTELO (imetelstat) may cause, or have attributed to it, adverse events that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or\ncompletion of clinical trials, impact its regulatory approval, or limit its commercial potential; (f) whether the IMpactMF Phase 3 trial for R/R MF has a positive outcome and demonstrates safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the FDA\nand international regulatory authorities, and whether the Company’s projected rates for enrollment and death events differ from actual rates, which may cause the interim and final analyses to occur later than anticipated; (g) whether any\nfuture safety or efficacy results of RYTELO treatment cause its benefit-risk profile to become unacceptable; (h) whether imetelstat actually demonstrates disease-modifying activity in patients and the ability to target the malignant stem and\nprogenitor cells of the underlying disease; (i) whether Geron meets its post-marketing requirements and commitments in the U.S. for RYTELO; (j) whether there are failures or delays in manufacturing or supplying sufficient quantities of\nRYTELO (imetelstat) or other clinical trial materials that impact commercialization of RYTELO or the continuation of the IMpactMF trial and other trials; (k) whether Geron is able to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities, obtain adequate coverage and third-party payor reimbursement, and achieve adequate acceptance in the marketplace; (l) whether Geron is able to obtain and maintain the exclusivity terms and scopes provided by\npatent and patent term extensions, regulatory exclusivity, and have freedom to operate; (m) that Geron may be unable to successfully commercialize RYTELO due to competitive products, or otherwise; (n) that Geron may decide to partner\nand not to commercialize independently in the U.S. or in Europe and other international markets; (o) whether Geron stays in compliance with and satisfies its obligations under its debt and synthetic royalty agreements; and (p) the impact of\ngeneral economic, industry or political climate in the U.S. or internationally and the effects of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additional\ninformation on the above risks and uncertainties and additional risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in Geron’s filings and periodic\nreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in such filings and reports, including Geron’s report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and subsequent filings and\nreports by Geron. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, and the facts and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements may change. Except as required\nby law, Geron disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future information, events, or circumstances.\n2\nWe Are Well-Positioned to Build Long-Term Commercial Value\nwith RYTELO (imetelstat)\nFirst full quarter of product revenue of $28.2 million in Q3 2024 exceeded expectations,\ndemonstrating commercial execution, high unmet need in LR-MDS, and compelling RYTELO\nvalue proposition\nReview of EU MAA could be completed by CHMP in late 2024 or early 2025, with potential EU\napproval in the first half of 2025, and potential commercialization in select EU markets in 2026\nPhase 3 IMpactMF trial interim analysis expected in early 2026 and final analysis expected in\nearly 2027, representing significant commercial opportunity and high unmet need patient\npopulation*\nLRS-MtDSr =o lonwger- rbiska mlyaelondycspela sstich syenderotm aesn; EUd M AcAa = sEuhro ppeaon Usniiotni Moanrke tfinog lAluothowriziantiogn A p$p2lic5ati0on ;m CHMilPl =i oConmm gittreeo fosr sMe pdicrinoal cPreodeucdts sfo rf Hruomamn U sse ynthetic\n*These projections are based on expectations about event rates (deaths) and enrollment, which can change over time and may differ from our current expectations\nroyalty and debt financing transactions provides strategic flexibility to invest in our future\nLR-MDS = lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; EU MAA = European Union Marketing Authorization Application; CHMP = Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use\n3\n*These projections are based on expectations about event rates (deaths) and enrollment, which can change over time and may differ from our current expectations\nRYTELO is Poised to Be a Standard-of-Care across High Unmet\nNeed LR-MDS Subgroups\nFirst-line ESA-ineligible patients 1 in 10 LR-MDS patients are ESA-ineligible and have limited\n(RS+ and RS-) treatment options.1\n~75% of LR-MDS patients are RS-, many of whom are\nRS- ESA relapsed/refractory patients particularly vulnerable to poor clinical outcomes and have few\nother treatment options.2\n~25% of LR-MDS patients are RS+, many of whom continue to\nRS+ ESA relapsed/refractory patients experience high red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden despite\navailable therapies.2\nESA = erythropoietin stimulating agents; R/R = relapsed/refractory; TD = transfusion dependent; RS = ring sideroblast\n1 Platzbecker U.
