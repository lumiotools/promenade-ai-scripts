The reverse stock split was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to shareholder approval granted at its Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting on November 20, 2024.\n\nThe reverse stock split is expected to become effective on December 3, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), and the Company’s ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on the split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq under the Company’s existing trading symbol “MYNZ” at market open on December 3, 2024, upon Nasdaq’s approval. The new CUSIP number for the Company’s ordinary shares following the reverse stock split will be N5436L119.\n\nThe reverse stock split is intended to increase the market price per share of its common stock to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and to make investments in the Company more attractive to investors by increasing the trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares on such market.\n\n**Information for Stockholders**\n\nOn the Effective Date, every 40 issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company will be converted automatically into one share of the Company’s ordinary shares without any change in the par value per share. Once effective, the reverse stock split will reduce the number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding from approximately 80.1 million shares to approximately 2.0 million.\n\nImmediately after the reverse stock split, each stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power will remain unchanged, except for minor changes and adjustments that will result from the treatment of fractional shares. The Company will not issue fractional shares but will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares. The rights and privileges of the holders of ordinary shares of the Company will be substantially unaffected by the reverse stock split.\n\nShareholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or in “street name” will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to each broker’s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split.\n\nRegistered shareholders holding pre-split shares of the Company’s ordinary shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Those shareholders holding shares of the Company’s ordinary shares in certificate form will receive a transmittal letter from our transfer agent, Transhare Corporation, with instructions as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.\n\n**Nasdaq Capital Market Compliance**\n\nMainz Biomed’s securities are currently listed on Nasdaq. In May 2024, the Company received written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying that, based on the closing bid price of Mainz Biomed’s ordinary shares for the last 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive trading days. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, Mainz Biomed were provided with an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of ordinary shares has to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to November 25, 2024. Additionally, the Company no longer meets the minimum $2,500,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Mainz Biomed received a staff determination letter (the “Determination Letter”) from Nasdaq stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by November 25, 2024, and is not eligible for a second 180-day period The Determination Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of Mainz Biomed’s ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company intends to shortly file a hearing request that automatically stays any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the “Panel”) following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has the authority to grant an extension not to exceed 180 days from the date of the Determination Letter.\n\n[**Please visit Mainz Biomed’s official website for investors at mainzbiomed.com/investors/ for more information**](https://mainzbiomed.com/investors)\n\nPlease follow us to stay up to date: [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mainz-biomed/about/) [**X (Previously Twitter)**](https://twitter.com/MainzBioMed) [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/MainzBioMed)\n\n**About Mainz Biomed NV** Mainz Biomed develops market-ready molecular genetic diagnostic solutions for life-threatening conditions.

These decreases are the result of the Company’s efforts to reduce costs during the first half of the year.\n  * Mainz Biomed published key findings from its groundbreaking eAArly DETECT study during a poster presentation at the renowned Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2024 in Washington D.C. The Company was awarded as a Poster of Distinction by the Digestive Disease Week judges for the presentation of industry leading results: 97% sensitivity for colorectal cancer (CRC) and 82% for advanced precancerous lesions. The eAArly DETECT results demonstrated that within the advanced precancerous lesion patients, 100% of those patients with high grade dysplasia were detected.\n  * The Company presented pivotal data from its largest cohort to date during a poster presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2024 Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois. This data combined results from the ColoFuture and eAArly DETECT studies including additional patient samples collected since the first reported study results, demonstrating the significance of its innovative screening approach. The new study data confirmed previous ColoFuture and eAArly DETECT study performance with sensitivity for CRC of 92% and 82% for advanced adenomas, including 96% detection of high-grade dysplasia.\n  * The Company announced significant improvements to its ColoAlert® product, currently being commercialized across Europe and in select international markets. These updates aim to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline lab operations. To increase screening/lab efficiency, Mainz Biomed introduced a novel DNA stabilizing buffer capable of accommodating varying sample volumes, addressing a common issue in the industry where samples are often either underfilled or overfilled, rendering them unsuitable for laboratory analysis. The new proprietary buffer used in ColoAlert® significantly reduces the necessity for additional sample submissions, thereby decreasing the time for the patients to obtain their results. This enhancement has enabled ColoAlert® to achieve the industry’s lowest retesting rates, ensuring that screening outcomes are delivered within just 2 – 3 days upon arrival at the laboratory.\n  * The Company expanded its collaboration with Liquid Biosciences to Mainz Biomed’s next-generation detection test for pancreatic cancer. The companies are leveraging Liquid Biosciences proprietary AI analysis technology platform (EMERGE) to extend and optimize the selection of novel biomarkers for PancAlert. The first phase of the collaboration included the evaluation of biomarkers from the Company’s research program co-funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research, and applied a single algorithm developed by Liquid Biosciences using its EMERGE platform. The results of this feasibility analysis were promising, leading the Company and Liquid Biosciences to believe that a PancAlert diagnostic test could, in the future, be combined with Mainz Biomed’s colorectal cancer screening product.\n\n\n\n**_Post-period Update_**\n\n  * In September 2024, Mainz Biomed announced encouraging feedback received from the FDA for the breakthrough device designation with the request to expand the current clinical data set with additional average risk population.\n  * In October 2024, the Company made the strategic decision to focus its efforts on three key initiatives for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 in order to maximize shareholder value. Those initiatives are: \n    * The continued growth of its ColoAlert® business in Europe;\n    * Development of its next generation colorectal cancer screening product; and\n    * Running a 2,000 patient study, with average risk patients in the U.S., to read out in the second half of 2025 (eAArly DETECT 2). With eAArly DETECT 2, the Company addresses the recent FDA feedback and prepares for a new submission for breakthrough device designation with an expanded data set, including a larger average-risk patient population.\n\n\n\nIn line with these strategic initiatives, the Company restructured its operations and implemented cost reductions its operating costs, primarily driven by the reduction of personnel and external consulting costs.\n\n“2024 has been a transitional year for Mainz Biomed. While navigating through a period of difficult markets, especially for small cap technology stocks, we are proud to have achieved many significant accomplishments to date,” commented Guido Baechler, Chief Executive Officer of Mainz Biomed. “As the Board and management team evaluated our path forward, we believe that a narrower focus on key strategic initiatives gives us the best opportunity to unlock shareholder value in the remainder of 2024 and 2025.”\n\n**_Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited):_**\n\n![](https://mainzbiomed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCFS_Loss_unauddited-1024x939.png)\n\n**_Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited):_**\n\n![](https://mainzbiomed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCFS_Financial-Position_Unaudited-976x1024.png)\n\n[Please visit Mainz Biomed’s official website for investors at mainzbiomed.com/investors/ for more information ](https://mainzbiomed.com/investors)\n\nPlease follow us to stay up to date: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mainz-biomed/about/) [X (Previously Twitter)](https://twitter.com/MainzBioMed) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MainzBioMed)\n\n**About Mainz Biomed NV** Mainz Biomed develops market-ready molecular genetic diagnostic solutions for life-threatening conditions.

This advanced version of the Company’s colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test is set to become the standard offering for all existing partners, reflecting its proven benefits in optimizing screening efficiency and improving user experience.\n\n**Widespread Transition to Enhanced ColoAlert**\n\nOne of the earliest partners to make the transition is GANZIMMUN Diagnostics, one of Germany’s premier laboratories, which licensed the ColoAlert test. GANZIMMUN will fully implement the enhanced version of the innovative DNA biomarker-based screening product by the beginning of next year, taking advantage of the significant improvements in sample processing and usability that have set a new industry benchmark.\n\n**Improving Customer Interest**\n\nPartners are particularly drawn to the enhanced features, such as the proprietary DNA stabilizing buffer that ensures reliable results despite varying sample volumes, and the streamlined collection devices that simplify at-home testing for users. These innovations have drastically reduced the need for retesting, offering faster turnaround times for patients, with results available in just 2–3 days from sample arrival.\n\n**Promotion at Key Medical Event**\n\nGANZIMMUN Diagnostics will showcase the enhanced ColoAlert at the 57th Medizinische Woche Baden-Baden, a medical congress in Germany focusing on complementary medicine, which takes place from October 30 to November 3, 2024. This underscores the increasing role of complementary medicine in cancer prevention and early detection. The event will provide an ideal platform to promote Mainz Biomed’s innovative DNA-based CRC screening test to medical professionals, integrative medicine practitioners, and researchers interested in advanced diagnostic solutions.\n\n“We are excited to support GANZIMMUN in introducing the enhanced ColoAlert at such a prestigious event,” stated Tarrin Khairi-Taraki, VP Commercial Operations at Mainz Biomed. “The 57th Medizinische Woche Baden-Baden provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the importance of early colorectal cancer detection and how our innovations are making this process more efficient.”\n\n[**Please visit Mainz Biomed’s official website for investors at mainzbiomed.com/investors/ for more information**](https://mainzbiomed.com/investors)\n\nPlease follow us to stay up to date: [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mainz-biomed/about/) [**X (Previously Twitter)**](https://twitter.com/MainzBioMed) [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/MainzBioMed)\n\n**About GANZIMMUN Diagnostics**\n\nGANZIMMUN Diagnostics is one of the leading laboratories in Europe for preventive and complementary medicine.

Management believes 2025 will be a transformative year, positioning Mainz Biomed for substantial growth in global markets, particularly through its innovative diagnostic solutions.\n\n“As we enter a critical phase in our company’s journey, Mainz Biomed’s vision remains focused on leading the way in cancer diagnostics,” said Guido Baechler, CEO of Mainz Biomed. “Our groundbreaking clinical results with our mRNA based next generation CRC screening test and our strategic pathway to FDA trials, which we plan to start in 2025, demonstrate our commitment to expanding into the world’s largest healthcare market. These efforts, combined with our growing international footprint, underscore why we believe Mainz Biomed is currently undervalued relative to its potential.” In the notes below, you will find more information about our current status and upcoming plans that we are executing, reaffirming our commitment to early cancer detection and the exciting developments that are currently underway.” Baechler commented further, “like all our shareholders, management and the Board of Directors are concerned and disappointed with the performance of our stock price. We commit to our shareholders that we will continue to strive to deliver what we have promised under difficult market conditions.” Baechler commented further, “We are strongly convinced that 2025 will be a transformative year, positioning Mainz Biomed for substantial growth in global markets, particularly through our innovative diagnostic solutions.”\n\n**Corporate Flagship Product: Breakthrough Data and U.S. Expansion**\n\nmRNA-based next-generation CRC screening tests are redefining standards in early cancer detection. Mainz Biomed’s flagship non-invasive test not only targets the early detection of colorectal cancer but also focuses on precancerous lesions, particularly advanced adenomas, demonstrating significant clinical success in both US and European trials. Presentations at DDW and ASCO this year have highlighted sensitivities exceeding 90% for detecting colorectal cancer and over 80% for advanced adenomas. Detecting advanced adenomas is crucial in preventing colorectal cancer, as identifying patients with these lesions allows for timely intervention through colonoscopy and adenoma removal, thereby averting cancer development.\n\nMainz Biomed, alongside other companies, emphasizes the use of stool-based samples for CRC and advanced adenoma detection due to their direct connection to cancer cells and adenomas. Recent reports suggesting the ease of blood tests over stool tests must be carefully evaluated, as extensive studies in the US and Europe have shown significantly lower sensitivity of blood tests in identifying advanced adenomas. This limitation arises because early-stage advanced adenomas are not typically connected to the body’s blood supply, making them undetectable through blood samples.\n\nIn early July the Company has announced that based on its robust clinical data package it submitted for FDA Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) for its next generation CRC screening test. Following encouraging feedback from the FDA, the Company has made the strategic decision to withdraw its BDD application to focus on extending its clinical research program. Mainz Biomed will expand its dataset to include a larger average-risk patient population with its pivotal ReconAAsense trial. The Company plans to submit this comprehensive data in 2025 to FDA.\n\nThe consistently positive data from the Company’s clinical feasibility studies presented at ASCO 2024 and Digestive Disease Week (DDW), provide a strong foundation as Mainz Biomed prepares for **U.S. FDA clinical trials in 2025** , a key milestone in its strategy to penetrate the U.S. market. Successful completion of the FDA trial will allow **Mainz Biomed’s next generation CRC screening test** to be marketed to millions of Americans at risk of colorectal cancer, representing a major revenue growth opportunity for the company.\n\n**Innovative Diagnostic Pipeline** In addition to its mRNA next generation CRC screening test, Mainz Biomed is advancing a robust **pipeline of cutting-edge diagnostic technologies** aimed at detecting multiple cancers, with PancAlert leading the way. Our focus on molecular diagnostics, powered by proprietary biomarkers, positions us to address a wide range of cancers early, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs globally. The success of our upcoming products will help diversify our revenue streams and strengthen our leadership in cancer diagnostics.\n\n**Current development and expansion of the current ColoAlert screening test**\n\nMainz Biomed has redeveloped and relaunched an expanded version of its first-generation CRC screening test currently commercialized in Germany and selected other countries in Europe. The change implemented in the ColoAlert product significantly simplified the workflow and reduced the retest rates. The feedback from the lab communities has been very positive and the Company expects this new product to further accelerate the growth and lab expansion.\n\n**Committed on delivering on key milestones for fair Company valuation**\n\nMainz Biomed’s strong clinical results, expanding pipeline, and upcoming FDA trial, it is the management’s position that the Company’s current stock price does not adequately reflect its true value. While the Mainz Biomed cannot directly influence the stock market, the management team is fully focused on **delivering on key milestones** and executing its strategy to unlock value for shareholders.\n\nPursuant to Nasdaq and SEC rules the June 30, 2024, financials are required by December 31, 2024. The Company plans to file during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Looking Ahead: FDA Trials and Major Growth in 2025**\n\n2024 is a year of continued clinical progress and market expansion, but the **FDA trials anticipated for 2025** represent a pivotal moment for Mainz Biomed. Successfully navigating the regulatory landscape in the U.S. will unlock significant opportunities to serve millions of patients in the world’s largest healthcare market.\n\nIn the meantime, the Company will continue to scale operations across Europe and other international markets, building on its **scientific leadership** in cancer diagnostics. With exciting innovations in the pipeline, Management is confident that Mainz Biomed is on track to revolutionize early cancer detection globally.\n\nFurther, we are pleased to have added a leader like Petra Starke to our team as a Brand Ambassador. Petra is a thought leader in the field of colorectal cancer. Her insights will continue to be invaluable as we focus our efforts in both Europe and the U.S.\n\n[**Please visit Mainz Biomed’s official website for investors at mainzbiomed.com/investors/ for more information**](https://mainzbiomed.com/investors)\n\nPlease follow us to stay up to date: [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mainz-biomed/about/) [**X (Previously Twitter)**](https://twitter.com/MainzBioMed) [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/MainzBioMed)\n\n**About Mainz Biomed NV** Mainz Biomed develops market-ready molecular genetic diagnostic solutions for life-threatening conditions.

Authorisation of amendment of articles of association, reverse stock split, and\nauthorisation for execution deed of amendment of articles of association\nReverse stock split\nIt is proposed to authorise the board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\"), in its\ndiscretion, to effect a reverse stock split within a range between 2:1 and 100:1.\nThe primary purpose for effecting the reverse stock split would be to increase the per-share\ntrading price of the Company's ordinary shares to maintain their listing on the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket. The Nasdaq Listing Rules require that listed shares maintain a minimum bid price of\nUSD 1.00 per share (the \"Minimum Bid Price Requirement\"). As previously reported, on\n28 May 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications\nDepartment notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the\nCompany did not meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company has been provided\nan initial period of 180 calendar days, or until 25 November 2024 (the \"Compliance Date\"),\nto regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nIf at any time during this 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares\nis at least USD 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Nasdaq\nListing Qualifications Department will provide the Company written confirmation that it\ncomplies with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the ordinary shares will continue to\nbe eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement by the Compliance Date, the Company may be eligible for additional time. To\nqualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement and all other\ninitial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum\nBid Price Requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the\ndeficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department will\ninform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days.\nBy granting the Company the flexibility to effect a reverse stock split, the Company will have\na contingency plan to increase the share price of the ordinary shares above USD 1.00 in the\nevent that it does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement prior to the\nCompliance Date or, if secured, within a second period of 180 days. For the 30 trading days\nduring the period 22 August 2024 to 3 October 2024 prior to the publication of these\nexplanatory notes, the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares has ranged from\nUSD 0.43 to USD 0.20, with an average closing bid price of USD 0.30.\nThe Board has considered the potential harm to the Company and its shareholders should\nNasdaq delist the Company's ordinary shares. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of\nthe Company's ordinary shares since alternatives are generally considered to be less liquid\nmarkets. An investor likely would find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate\n62000246/MMB 2 42653710v1\nquotations in seeking to buy, the Company's ordinary shares on an over-the-counter market.\nFurther, many investors likely would not buy or sell the Company's ordinary shares due to\ndifficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in\nsecurities not listed on a national exchange or for other reasons.\nIf and when the Board determines to implement the reverse stock split, the reverse stock split\nratio will be set within a range between 2:1 and 100:1 (the \"Split Ratio Range\") subject to the\nproviso that the reverse stock split will be implemented in such a way that it does not entail a\ncapital reduction. The Board is authorised to do whatever is necessary to avoid a capital\nreduction. If the reverse stock split is implemented, the reverse stock split ratio as set by the\nBoard will be announced in accordance with applicable laws.\nIf the EGM authorises the Board to effect a reverse stock split, the Board will have the sole\nauthority to elect, at any time prior to the annual general meeting of the Company to be held\nin 2025, whether or not to effect a reverse stock split. The Board will have the flexibility to\ndecide whether or not a reverse stock split, and at what ratio within the Split Ratio Range, is\nin the Company's best interests.\nUpon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, each shareholder will own a reduced number of\nordinary shares. However, the Company expects that the market price of the ordinary shares\nimmediately after the reverse stock split will increase above the market price of the ordinary\nshares immediately prior to the reverse stock split, which is designed to help the Company to\nregain and maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The proposed\nreverse stock split will be effected simultaneously for all of the ordinary shares and the ratio\nfor the reverse stock split, once determined, will be the same for all of the ordinary shares.

Close\n7\nEXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE AGENDA OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL\nMEETING OF MAINZ BIOMED N.V.\n1. Opening\n2. Reverse stock split, amendment of articles of association and authorisation execution deed of\namendment of articles of association\nReverse stock split\nIt is proposed to authorise the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), in its discretion, to effect a\nreverse stock split within a range between 2:1 and 100:1.\nThe primary purpose for effecting the reverse stock split would be to increase the per-share trading price of\nthe Company’s ordinary shares to maintain their listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq Listing\nRules require that listed shares maintain a minimum bid price of USD 1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid\nPrice Requirement”). As previously reported, on 28 May 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter\nfrom the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive\nbusiness days, the Company did not meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company has been\nprovided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until 25 November 2024 (the “Compliance Date”), to\nregain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nIf at any time during this 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least\nUSD 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications\nDepartment will provide the Company written confirmation that it complies with the Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement and the ordinary shares will continue to be eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the\nCompliance Date, the Company may be eligible for additional time. To qualify, the Company will be required\nto meet the continued listing requirement and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market,\nwith the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its\nintention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if\nnecessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department will\ninform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days.\nBy granting the Company the flexibility to effect a reverse stock split, the Company will have a contingency\nplan to increase the share price of the ordinary shares above USD 1.00 in the event that it does not regain\ncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement prior to the Compliance Date or, if secured, within a\nsecond period of 180 days. For the 30 trading days during the period 22 August 2024 to 3 October 2024 prior\nto the publication of these explanatory notes, the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares has\nranged from USD 0.43 to USD 0.20, with an average closing bid price of USD 0.30.\nThe Board has considered the potential harm to the Company and its shareholders should Nasdaq delist the\nCompany’s ordinary shares. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of the Company’s ordinary shares\nsince alternatives are generally considered to be less liquid markets. An investor likely would find it less\nconvenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, the Company’s ordinary shares on an\nover-the-counter market. Further, many investors likely would not buy or sell the Company’s ordinary shares\ndue to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities\nnot listed on a national exchange or for other reasons.\n8\nIf and when the Board determines to implement the reverse stock split, the reverse stock split ratio will be\nset within a range between 2:1 and 100:1 (the “Split Ratio Range”) subject to the proviso that the reverse\nstock split will be implemented in such a way that it does not entail a capital reduction. The Board is\nauthorised to do whatever is necessary to avoid a capital reduction. If the reverse stock split is implemented,\nthe reverse stock split ratio as set by the Board will be announced in accordance with applicable laws.\nIf the EGM authorises the Board to effect a reverse stock split, the Board will have the sole authority to elect,\nat any time prior to the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2025, whether or not to effect\na reverse stock split. The Board will have the flexibility to decide whether or not a reverse stock split, and at\nwhat ratio within the Split Ratio Range, is in the Company’s best interests.\nUpon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, each shareholder will own a reduced number of ordinary shares.\nHowever, the Company expects that the market price of the ordinary shares immediately after the reverse\nstock split will increase above the market price of the ordinary shares immediately prior to the reverse stock\nsplit, which is designed to help the Company to regain and maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement. The proposed reverse stock split will be effected simultaneously for all of the ordinary shares\nand the ratio for the reverse stock split, once determined, will be the same for all of the ordinary shares. Ïhe\nreverse stock split will affect all shareholders uniformly and will not affect any shareholder’s percentage\nownership interest in the Company, except to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in any of the\nshareholders owning a fractional interest as described below. Likewise, the reverse stock split will affect all\nholders of outstanding equity awards under the Company’s equity incentive plans substantially the same,\nexcept to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in a fractional interest as described below.\nProportionate voting rights and other rights of the holders of ordinary shares will not be affected by the\nproposed reverse stock split, except to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in any shareholders\nowning a fractional interest as described below.\nThe nominal value per ordinary share would be adjusted from EUR 0.01 per share before the reverse stock\nsplit to a proportionately increased nominal value per share after the reverse stock split, based on the final\nreverse stock split ratio, as described below.\nThe ordinary shares are currently registered under section 12(b) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of\n1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and the Company is subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of\nthe Exchange Act. The reverse stock split will not affect the registration of the ordinary shares under the\nExchange Act.\nShares that are held in registered form will be consolidated and converted into shares based on the new\nnominal value to be determined in accordance with the final reverse stock split ratio. Fractional shares created\nas a result of the consolidation and conversion will be subject to the rights specified in article 4.5, 29.2 and\n31.1 of the articles of association of the Company contained in the draft of the deed of amendment of articles\nof association referred to below.\n9\nShares that are held through the facilities of Cede & Co. as nominee for the Depositary Trust Company will\nbe consolidated and converted into a rounded down number of whole shares and the holders will receive a\ncash-in-lieu of fractional shares payment from their bank or intermediary.\nAmendment articles of association\nFurthermore, for the purpose of effecting the reverse stock split, it is proposed to approve the amendment of\nthe Company’s articles of association in accordance with the draft of the deed of amendment of articles of\nassociation drawn up by CMS Derks Star Busmann N.V. in connection with the EGM and published on the\nCompany’s website.\nThe amount of the authorised capital will be derived from the reverse stock split ratio as set by the Board\nsubject to the proviso that it will not be more than five times the issued capital, as prescribed by Dutch law.\nThe authorised share capital will be divided nine-tenths into ordinary shares and one-tenth into preferred\nshares. Ordinary shares and preferred shares will have the same nominal value. There are no preferred shares\noutstanding at the moment.\nThe proposed amendment to the articles of association will not change the terms of the ordinary shares. After\nthe reverse stock split, the ordinary shares will have the same voting rights and rights to dividends and\ndistributions and will be identical in all other respects to the ordinary shares now authorised. The ordinary\nshares issued pursuant to the reverse stock split will remain fully paid and nonassessable. Following the\nreverse stock split, the Company will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the\nExchange Act.\nAuthorisation for execution of deed of amendment of articles of association\nFinally, it is proposed that each director of the Company and each civil law notary, assigned civil law notary,\ncandidate civil law notary, notarial assistant and notarial secretary working with CMS Derks Star Busmann\nN.V. be authorised to have the deed of amendment of articles of association executed and to perform all other\nlegal acts which the authorised person deems necessary in connection therewith.\n3.

By targeting RNA\nabnormalities or symptoms manifest molecules associated with the advanced stage of\nadenomas, these biomarkers can distinguish\nbetween advanced adenomas and less advanced\nforms or benign conditions\n\nmRNA biomarkers reflect the dynamic\nchanges in gene expression that occur\n\nduring the progression of adenomas to mRNA biomarkers’s sensitivity allows for the\nadvanced stages. As adenomas detection of even small quantities of RNA molecules\nevolve, certain genes may be associated with advanced adenomas. This sensitivity\nupregulated or downregulated, and enables the detection of adenomas at early stages\nRNA biomarkers can capture these\nchanges, providing insights into the\n\nmRNA expression pattern changes can used as an\nstage of adenoma development\nearly predictor for the onset of a certain disease\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.

In addition, it is not the\nduty of the Audit Committee to conduct investigations or to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE SUBJECT MATTER FINANCIAL EXPERTS\nWhen do the rules regarding audit committee financial experts apply?\nThe rules require the Company to make certain disclosures relating to audit committee financial experts in the registration statement on\nForm S-1 that it will be filing in connection with its proposed public offering and its annual reports (or its proxy statements for its\nannual meetings, if such information is incorporated by reference into its annual reports and these proxy statements are filed within 120\nof days of the end of the fiscal year) that it must file on an annual basis thereafter.\nWhat disclosure is required by the rules?\nThe rules regarding audit committee financial experts require the Company to disclose that its board of directors has determined that\nthe Company either:\n1. has at least one audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee; or\n2. does not have an audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee.\nIf the Company discloses that it does not have an audit committee financial expert, the Company must disclose the reasons why it does\nnot. If the Company discloses that it has at least one audit committee financial expert, then it must disclose the name of at least one of\nits audit committee financial experts and whether such person is independent of management. The Company is permitted, but not\nrequired, to disclose that it has more than one audit committee financial expert. If the Company discloses the names of any additional\naudit committee financial experts, then it must also disclose whether these additional audit committee financial experts are independent\nof management.\nWhat does the Company’s board of directors need to do as a result of the rules?\nTo provide the required disclosure under the rules, the Company’s board of directors must determine whether it has at least one audit\ncommittee financial expert serving on its audit committee. This will require the Company’s board of directors to:\n1. evaluate the qualifications of the prospective members of its audit committee;\n2. determine whether at least one prospective member of its audit committee qualifies as an audit committee financial\nexpert as defined in the applicable rules;\n3. if a person is an audit committee financial expert because he or she has acquired the requisite attributes through “other\nrelevant experience,” the board of directors should determine what constitutes this “other relevant experience” as it must be\ndisclosed; and\n4. if the Company has determined that none of the prospective members of its audit committee qualify as an audit\ncommittee financial expert; the board of directors may want to determine which aspects of the definition of audit committee\nfinancial expert its prospective audit committee members do satisfy as the Company may want to disclose this information.\nThe board of directors may evaluate each prospective member of its audit committee or it may end its evaluation once it\ndetermines that it has at least one audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee. The SEC was clear in the\nadopting release that a company cannot satisfy these disclosure requirements by stating that it has decided not to decide or by\nsimply disclosing the qualifications of all of its audit committee members.\nIn the adopting release, the SEC did not specify the exact method by which the board of directors should conduct its evaluation, but\nit did indicate that it thought that it was appropriate for the determination of the board of directors to be subject to relevant state\nlaw principles such as the business judgment rule. Based on the applicable rules for determining qualification as an audit\ncommittee financial expert described below, the Company’s board of directors may determine that none of the current members of\nthe Company’s board of directors are audit committee financial experts.\nWho qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” under the rules?\nThe applicable rules define an “audit committee financial expert” as a person who has each of the following five attributes:\n1. an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements;\n2. the ability to assess the general application of GAAP in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals, and\nreserves;\n3. experience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of\ncomplexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably\nbe expected to be raised by the Company’s financial statements, or experience actively supervising one or more persons\nengaged in such activities;\n4. an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting; and\n5. an understanding of audit committee functions.\nIn addition, the person must have acquired the five attributes through experiences described in at least one of the following categories:\n1. education and experience as a principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant\nor auditor or experience in one or more positions that involve the performance of similar functions;\n2. experience actively supervising a principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant,\nauditor, or person performing similar functions;\n3. experience overseeing or assessing the performance of companies or public accountants with respect to the\npreparation, auditing or evaluation of financial statements; or other relevant experience (it should be noted that if the board\ndetermines that a person identified as an audit committee financial expert qualifies as such because that person acquired the\nrequisite attributes through “other relevant experience” as opposed to through one of the prior three categories, then the\nCompany must briefly list that person’s relevant experience).\nIn the SEC release adopting these rules, the SEC elaborated on certain aspects of this definition in a few notable respects, which are\ndiscussed below.\nExperience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements. In the adopting release, the SEC suggested that experience\nwith financial statements as an investment banker, venture capitalist or professional financial analyst would, in many cases, satisfy the\nrequirement that an audit committee financial expert have experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements.\nThis statement should be contrasted with the SEC’s earlier proposal that experience preparing or auditing financial statements (e.g., as an\nindependent accountant/auditor or chief financial/chief accounting officer) would be required. The SEC indicated that the final\nrequirement was intended to “capture the clear intent of the statute that an audit committee financial expert must have experience actually\nworking directly and closely with financial statements in a way that provided familiarity with the contents of financial statements and the\nprocesses behind them.”\nGenerally comparable breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues. In making a determination regarding whether the breadth\nand level of complexity of accounting issues with which the person has experience are generally comparable to those that can\nreasonably be expected to be raised by the Company’s financial statements, the SEC indicated that a person’s experience would not\nhave to be in the same industry as the Company, or with a public company.\nThe SEC moved away from its earlier proposal, which had focused on the comparability of the actual accounting issues with which the\nperson had experience, and, in the adopting release, suggested that the board of directors should focus on a variety of more general\nfactors, such as the size of the company with which the person has experience, the scope of that company’s operations and the\ncomplexity of its financial statements and accounting.\nActively supervising. In the adopting release, the SEC made the following statement relating to the concept of “actively supervising”:\nThe term “active supervision” means more than the mere existence of a traditional hierarchical reporting relationship between\nsupervisor and those being supervised. Rather, we mean that a person engaged in active supervision participates in, and contributes to,\nthe process of addressing, albeit at a supervisory level, the same general types of issues regarding preparation, auditing, analysis or\nevaluation of financial statements as those addressed by the person or persons being supervised. We also mean that the supervisor\nshould have experience that has contributed to the general expertise necessary to prepare, audit, analyze or evaluate financial statements\nthat is at least comparable to the general expertise of those being supervised. A principal executive officer should not be presumed to\nqualify. A principal executive officer with considerable operations involvement, but little financial or accounting involvement, likely\nwould not be exercising the necessary active supervision. Active participation in, and contribution to, the process, albeit at a\nsupervisory level, of addressing financial and accounting issues that demonstrates a general expertise in the area would be necessary.\nUnderstanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. In the adopting release, the SEC elaborated on the\nrequirement that audit committee financial experts have an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as\nfollows:\nIt is necessary that the audit committee financial expert understand the purpose, and be able to evaluate the effectiveness, of a\ncompany’s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. It is important that the audit committee financial expert understand\nwhy the internal controls and procedures for financial reporting exist, how they were developed, and how they operate. Previous\nexperience establishing or evaluating a company’s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting can, of course, contribute to a\nperson’s understanding of these matters, but the attribute as rephrased properly focuses on the understanding rather than the experience.\nExperience overseeing or assessing the performance of companies or public accountants with respect to the preparation, auditing, or\nevaluation of financial statements. In the adopting release, the SEC cited “individuals serving in governmental, self-regulatory and\nprivate-sector bodies overseeing the banking, insurance and securities industries who work on issues related to financial statements on a\nregular basis” as an example of the type of person to whom this provision was meant to apply.\nOther relevant experience. In the adopting release, the SEC stated that this “catch all” provision was added to recognize that the\nrequired attributes of an audit committee financial expert can be acquired in many different ways; however, acquiring them through\nexperience and not “merely education” is required.\nDoes the identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert alter the duties, obligations or liabilities of that person or the\nother members of the audit committee?\nNo. Because of concerns that directors designated and publicly identified as audit committee financial experts might become subject to\ngreater liability, and to make clear that the other members of the audit committee should not be expected to perform their duties any\ndifferently as a result of the designation or identification of an audit committee financial expert, the SEC included a safe harbor in the\nnew rules to clarify that:\n1. a person who is determined to be an audit committee financial expert will not be deemed an “expert” for any\npurpose, including for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified\nas an audit committee financial expert;\n2. the designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on that person\nany duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on that person as a\nmember of the audit committee and board of directors in the absence of the designation or identification; and\n3. the designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert does not affect the duties,\nobligations, or liability of any other member of the audit committee or board of directors.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE COMPLAINT PROCEDURES\nThis policy outlines the procedures that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Mainz Biomed, B.V. (together with its\nsubsidiaries, the “Company”) has established with respect to the receipt, treatment and retention of complaints received by the\nCompany regarding:\n1. accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, including the confidential, anonymous\nsubmission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, or\n2. potential violations of the federal securities laws, including any rules and regulations thereunder, or the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) (collectively, “Complaints”).\n1.

Any Complaint received by Audit Committee, the Compliance Officer, or the Compliance Hotline in\naccordance with the procedures set forth above will be forwarded in a confidential manner to the Chairperson of\nthe Audit Committee as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such Complaint. In addition,\nmanagement will be informed that any Complaint received outside of these procedures should likewise be\nforwarded in a confidential manner to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee as soon as reasonably practicable\nfollowing receipt of such Complaint.\nd. To ensure that the Compliant Procedure is not inadvertently or improperly screening out Complaints that\nshould be viewed by the Audit Committee, the Company’s Compliance Officer will be charged with preparing\nand submitting to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee prior to each regularly scheduled meeting of the Audit\nCommittee, a table or other report detailing the time, date, nature and disposition of each complaint received by\nthe Compliance Officer and/or the Compliance Hotline since the date of the prior report. The table or other report\nwill be reviewed by the Audit Committee at its next regularly-scheduled meeting.\n2. Procedures for Treating Complaints\na.

In connection with the initial evaluation, the Chairperson or his or her designee will decide:\ni. whether the Complaint requires immediate investigation;\nii. whether it can be held for discussion at the next regularly-scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee\nor whether a special meeting of the Audit Committee should be called; or\niii. whether it does not relate to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters or\npotential violations of the federal securities laws or the FCPA and should be reviewed by a party other than\nthe Audit Committee in accordance with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or other\npolicies.\nb. In any event, each Complaint will be discussed at the next meeting of the Audit Committee. At that meeting,\nthe Audit Committee will decide as to whether and how such Complaint will be investigated, or if the\ninvestigation has commenced, how to proceed with such investigation. The Audit Committee may elect among\nthe following options or may investigate the Complaint in another manner determined by the Audit Committee:\ni. The Audit Committee may choose to investigate the Complaint on its own.\nii. The Audit Committee may select a responsible designee within the Company to investigate the\nComplaint.

The Audit Committee may retain an outside party (other than the Company’s independent\nauditor) to investigate the Complaint and assist in the Complaint’s evaluation.\niv. The Audit Committee may retain outside counsel to initiate an investigation and work either\nwith internal parties or an outside financial/forensic auditing company to assist in such investigation.\nThe investigating party designated by the Audit Committee will be permitted reasonable access to the Company and its documents and\ncomputer systems for purposes of conducting the investigation. At the conclusion of its investigation, the investigating party will be\nresponsible for making a full report to the Audit Committee with respect to the Complaint and, if requested by the Audit Committee, to\nmake recommendations for corrective actions, if any, to be taken by the Company.\nThe Audit Committee will consider, if applicable, the recommendations of the investigating party and determine whether any corrective\nactions should be taken. The Audit Committee will report to the Board of Directors not later than its next regularly-scheduled meeting\nwith respect to the Complaint for which such investigation has been completed and, if applicable, any recommended corrective actions.\nIn the event that the Complaint involves any Director of the Company (whether in his or her role as a director, employee, or officer of\nthe Company or otherwise), the Audit Committee will make its report in an Executive Session of the Board of Directors (exclusive of\nany Director involved in such Complaint).\n3. Procedures for Retaining Records Regarding Complaints\na.

If a\nComplaint becomes the subject of a criminal investigation or civil litigation, all documents related to that\nComplaint will be retained until such investigation or litigation is resolved, including all appeals.

Disciplinary Action\na.

Periodic Review of Procedures\na. The Audit Committee will review the procedures outlined above and consider changes to such\nprocedures periodically.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY\nFOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES\n1. Statement of Principles\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Mainz Biomed, B.V. recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence\nof its independent auditor. Under the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to\nimplement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit\nservices performed by the independent auditor in order to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor’s\nindependence from the Company.\nThe SEC’s rules permit the Audit Committee to pre-approve such services by establishing policies and procedures for audit and\nnon-audit services, provided that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the service, the Audit Committee is informed of\neach service, and such policies and procedures do not result in the delegation of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities to\nmanagement. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has adopted, and the Audit Committee has ratified, this Pre-Approval Policy for\nAudit and Non-Audit Services (this “Policy”), which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services\nproposed to be performed by the independent auditor may be pre-approved. Unless a type of service has been pre-approved\npursuant to this Policy, it must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee before it may be provided by the independent\nauditor. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require separate pre-approval by\nthe Audit Committee.\nThe appendices to this Policy describe in detail the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other Services that have the pre-approval of\nthe Audit Committee and do not result in the delegation of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities to management. The term of any\npre-approval under this Policy is twelve (12) months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee approves a\ndifferent period. The Audit Committee may periodically revise the list of services pre-approved pursuant to this Policy, based on\nsubsequent determinations. Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, pre-approval is waived for non-audit services that satisfy the\n“de minimus” provisions of Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n2. Delegation\nAs provided in the SEC’s rules, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to the Chairperson of the Audit\nCommittee. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions\nto the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee delegates to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee\nthe authority to pre-approve the provision by the Company’s independent auditor of non-audit services if time constraints require\nthat such pre-approval occur prior to the Audit Committee’s next scheduled meeting.\n3. Audit Services\nAudit Services are services necessary for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and the review of the Company’s\nquarterly financial statements and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and\nregulatory filings or engagements. The engagement of the independent auditor to perform the audit of the Company’s annual\nfinancial statements and the review of the Company’s quarterly financial statements as well as the terms and fees for such\nengagement will be subject to separate pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any\nchanges in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Company structure or other items.\n4. Audit-Related Services\nAudit-Related Services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of\nthe Company’s financial statements that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee believes that\nthe provision of Audit-Related Services does not impair the independence of the auditor and, consistent with the SEC’s rules on\nauditor independence, has pre-approved the Audit-Related Services, if any, in Appendix B. All other Audit-Related Services not\nlisted in Appendix B must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee.\n5. Tax Services\nTax Services are professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. The Audit Committee believes\nthat the independent auditor can provide Tax Services to the Company without impairing the auditor’s independence, and the SEC\nhas stated that the independent auditor may provide such services. However, the Audit Committee will not permit the retention of\nthe independent auditor in connection with (i) a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the sole business\npurpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended and related regulations, or (ii) representing the Company before a tax court, district court or federal court of\nclaims.\n6. All Other Services\nThe Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC’s rules prohibiting the independent auditor from providing specific non-audit\nservices, that the independent auditor may provide other types of non-audit services (“All Other Services”) that are not specifically\nprohibited and that are not Audit-Related Services or Tax Services. Accordingly, the Audit Committee believes it may pre-approve\nAll Other Services that it believes are routine and recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are\nconsistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor independence.\n7. Pre-Approval Fee Levels or Budgeted Amounts\nPre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided by the independent auditor will be established\nperiodically by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require separate pre-approval\nby the Audit Committee.\n8. Supporting Documentation\nWith respect to each service pre-approved under this Policy, the independent auditor has provided, or will provide for addition to\nthe appendices hereto, detailed back-up documentation to the Audit Committee regarding the specific services pre-approved under\nthis Policy. The detailed back-up documentation provided to the Audit Committee is incorporated by reference into, and shall be\ndeemed a part of, this Policy.\n9. Procedures\nAll requests or applications for pre-approval of services to be provided by the independent auditor will be submitted to the Audit\nCommittee, the Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer for submission to the Audit Committee and must include a\ndetailed description of the services to be rendered and detailed back-up documentation regarding the specific services to be\nprovided. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services as they are rendered by the independent\nauditor.\nIn the event that time constraints require pre-approval prior to the Audit Committee’s next scheduled meeting, the Chairperson of\nthe Audit Committee will have the authority to grant such pre-approval, provided that the Chairperson is independent, and, in\naccordance with Section II of this Policy, will report such pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at the next scheduled\nAudit Committee meeting. Requests for pre-approval by the Chairperson of the Audit Committee will be submitted to the\nChairperson by both the independent auditor and the Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer and must include a detailed\ndescription of the services to be rendered and a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent\nwith the SEC’s rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee may from time to time limit the ability of the Chairperson of\nthe Audit Committee to pre-approve services in accordance with the provisions of this Section IX.\nRequests or applications to provide services that require separate approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit\nCommittee by both the independent auditor and the Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer, and must include a detailed\ndescription of the services to be rendered and a statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent with\nthe SEC’s rules on auditor independence.\nThe Audit Committee has designated the Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer to monitor the performance of all\nservices provided by the independent auditor and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The Chief\nFinancial Officer or other designated officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis on the results of this\nmonitoring. The Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer and management will immediately report to the Chairperson of\nthe Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that comes to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or other designated officer\nor any member of management. The directives in the paragraph do not delegate any required duties or authority of the Audit\nCommittee to management or relieve the Audit Committee from any of its responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, and the rules of the SEC.\nMINUTES:\nThe Audit Committee will maintain written minutes of its meetings, which minutes will be filed with the minutes of the meetings of the\nBoard."

          "content": "CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS\nCONDUCT\nVERSION 01: OCTOBER 2021\nMAINZ BIOMED N.V.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\n1. Introduction.\n1.1 The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Mainz Biomed N.V. (the \"Company\") has adopted this Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct (the \"Code\") in order to:\n(a) promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of\ninterest;\n(b) promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the\nCompany files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and in other public communications\nmade by the Company;\n(c) promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n(d) promote the protection of Company assets, including corporate opportunities and confidential information;\n(e) promote fair dealing practices;\n(f) deter wrongdoing; and\n(g) ensure accountability for adherence to the Code.\n1.2 All directors, officers and employees are required to be familiar with the Code, comply with its provisions and report\nany suspected violations as described below in Section 10, Reporting and Enforcement.\n2. Honest and Ethical Conduct.\n2.1 The Company's policy is to promote high standards of integrity by conducting its affairs honestly and ethically.\n2.2 Each director, officer and employee must act with integrity and observe the highest ethical standards of business\nconduct in his or her dealings with the Company's customers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and\nanyone else with whom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job.\n3. Conflicts of Interest.\n3.1 A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's private interest (or the interest of a member of his or her family)\ninterferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict of interest can arise when an\nemployee, officer or director (or a member of his or her family) takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his\nor her work for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee, officer or director (or a\nmember of his or her family) receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company.\n3.2 Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of, employees or their family members are\nof special concern and could constitute improper personal benefits to the recipients of such loans or guarantees, depending on the\nfacts and circumstances. Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of, any director or executive officer\nor their family members are expressly prohibited.\n3.3 Whether or not a conflict of interest exists or will exist can be unclear. Conflicts of interest should be avoided unless\nspecifically authorized as described in Section 3.4.\n3.4 Persons other than directors and executive officers who have questions about a potential conflict of interest or who\nbecome aware of an actual or potential conflict should discuss the matter with, and seek a determination and prior authorization or\napproval from, their supervisor, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. A supervisor may not authorize or\napprove conflict of interest matters or make determinations as to whether a problematic conflict of interest exists without first\nproviding the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer with a written description of the activity and seeking the Chief\nExecutive Officer’s or the Chief Financial Officer's written approval. If the supervisor is himself involved in the potential or actual\nconflict, the matter should instead be discussed directly with the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer.\nDirectors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior authorizations or approvals of potential conflicts\nof interest exclusively from the Audit Committee.\n4. Compliance.\n4.1 Employees, officers and directors should comply, both in letter and spirit, with all applicable laws, rules and\nregulations in the cities, states and countries in which the Company operates.\n4.2 Although not all employees, officers and directors are expected to know the details of all applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from appropriate personnel.

Each director, officer and employee must cooperate fully with the Company's accounting and internal audit departments,\nas well as the Company's independent public accountants and counsel.\n5.3 Each director, officer and employee who is involved in the Company's disclosure process must:\n(a) be familiar with and comply with the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control\nover financial reporting; and\n(b) take all necessary steps to ensure that all filings with the SEC and all other public communications about\nthe financial and business condition of the Company provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.\n6. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets.\n6.1 All directors, officers and employees should protect the Company's assets and ensure their efficient use.

All directors, officers and employees owe a duty to the Company to advance its interests when the\nopportunity arises. Directors, officers and employees are prohibited from taking for themselves personally (or for the benefit of friends or\nfamily members) opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company assets, property, information or position. Directors,\nofficers and employees may not use Company assets, property, information or position for personal gain (including gain of friends or\nfamily members). In addition, no director, officer or employee may compete with the Company.\n8. Confidentiality. Directors, officers and employees should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the\nCompany or by its customers, suppliers or partners, except when disclosure is expressly authorized or is required or permitted by law.\nConfidential information includes all nonpublic information (regardless of its source) that might be of use to the Company's competitors or\nharmful to the Company or its customers, suppliers or partners if disclosed.\n9. Fair Dealing. Each director, officer and employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers, partners, service\nproviders, competitors, employees and anyone else with whom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job.

Oktober 2024****—**[**Mainz Biomed N.V.**](https://mainzbiomed.com/) (NASDAQ: MYNZ), („Mainz Biomed” oder das „Unternehmen”), ein molekulargenetisches Diagnostikunternehmen, das sich auf die Krebsfrüherkennung spezialisiert hat, hat heute die Ergebnisse für das erste Halbjahr 2024 bekanntgegeben, sowie über die bisherigen Fortschritte und den Ausblick auf das Jahresende und die strategische Ausrichtung für 2025 informiert.\n\n**_Die wichtigsten Fortschritte 2024_**\n\n  * Der Umsatz des Unternehmens stieg in den ersten sechs Monaten des Jahres 2024 im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um 4%, während der operative Verlust und der Verlust vor Steuern um 32% bzw. 26% zurückgingen. Diese Rückgänge sind auf die Aktivitäten des Unternehmens zurückzuführen, die Kosten im ersten Halbjahr zu reduzieren.\n  * Mainz Biomed veröffentlichte wichtige Ergebnisse seiner richtungsweisenden eAArly-DETECT-Studie im Rahmen einer Posterpräsentation auf der renommierten Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2024 in Washington D.C., USA. Das Unternehmen hat von der Jury der DDW für die Vorstellung branchenführender Ergebnisse die Auszeichnung ‚Poster of Distinction‘ erhalten: 97% Sensitivität für Darmkrebs und 82% für fortgeschrittene Adenome. Die eAArly-DETECT-Daten zeigten, dass bei den Patienten mit fortgeschrittenen Krebsvorstufen 100% der hochgradigen Dysplasien entdeckt wurden.\n  * Das Unternehmen präsentierte im Rahmen einer Posterpräsentation auf der Jahrestagung 2024 der American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, USA, pivotale Ergebnisse aus seiner bisher größten Kohorte. Diese Daten kombinierten die Ergebnisse der ColoFuture- und eAArly-DETECT-Studien, einschließlich zusätzlicher Patientenproben, die nach den ursprünglich veröffentlichten Studienergebnissen analysiert wurden. Sie belegten die Bedeutung des innovativen Screening-Ansatzes. Die neuen Studiendaten bestätigten die Ergebnisse der ColoFuture- und eAArly-DETECT-Studien mit einer Sensitivität von 92% für Darmkrebs und 82% für fortgeschrittene Adenome, sowie 96% für die Erkennung hochgradiger Dysplasien.\n  * Das Unternehmen launchte eine weiterentwickelte Version seines ColoAlert-Darmkrebstests mit verbesserten Funktionen. Der Test wird aktuell in Europa und in ausgewählten internationalen Märkten vertrieben. Die Neuerungen zielen darauf ab, die Kundenzufriedenheit zu steigern und die Laborabläufe zu vereinfachen. Um die Screening- und Laboreffizienz zu erhöhen, hat Mainz Biomed einen neuartigen DNA-Stabilisierungspuffer entwickelt, der sich an unterschiedliche Probenvolumina anpassen lässt. Damit wird ein in der Diagnostikindustrie häufig auftretendes Problem adressiert, bei dem Probengefäße oft entweder unter- oder überfüllt sind, wodurch sie im Labor nicht analysiert werden können. Der neue, firmeneigene Puffer, der in ColoAlert® verwendet wird, reduziert die Notwendigkeit erneuter Probenübermittlungen erheblich und verkürzt so die Zeit, bis die Patienten ihre Ergebnisse erhalten. Durch diese Verbesserung konnte ColoAlert® die Testwiederholungsrate auf den branchenweit niedrigsten Wert reduzieren und sicherstellen, dass die Screening-Ergebnisse innerhalb von nur 2–3 Tagen nach Eintreffen der Probe im Labor vorliegen.\n  * Das Unternehmen hat seine Zusammenarbeit mit Liquid Biosciences auf Mainz Biomeds Next-Generation-Test zur Erkennung von Bauchspeicheldrüsenkrebs ausgeweitet. Die Unternehmen werden die von Liquid Biosciences entwickelte, auf der KI-Technologie basierende Analyse-Plattform (EMERGE) einsetzen, um die Auswahl neuartiger Biomarker für PancAlert zu erweitern und zu optimieren. Die erste Phase der Zusammenarbeit umfasste die Evaluierung von Biomarkern aus einem Forschungsprogramm des Unternehmens, das vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung mitfinanziert wurde. Darin wurde die Anwendung eines einzelnen Algorithmus, der von Liquid Biosciences unter Verwendung seiner EMERGE-Plattform entwickelt wurde, untersucht. Die Ergebnisse dieser Machbarkeitsanalyse waren vielversprechend und führten zu der Erkenntnis, dass ein diagnostischer PancAlert-Test zukünftig mit Mainz Biomeds Darmkrebs-Screeningprodukt kombiniert werden könnte.\n\n\n\n**_Update nach Ablauf der Berichtsperiode_**\n\n  * Im September 2024 gab Mainz Biomed bekannt, dass positives Feedback von der FDA für die Breakthrough Device Designation eingegangen sei, mit der Aufforderung, den aktuellen klinischen Datensatz um zusätzliche Daten aus der durchschnittlich gefährdeten Bevölkerung zu erweitern.\n  * Im Oktober 2024 hat das Unternehmen die strategische Entscheidung getroffen, seine Aktivitäten bis zum Jahresende und für das Jahr 2025 auf drei zentrale Initiativen zu konzentrieren, um den Shareholder Value zu steigern: \n    * den kontinuierlichen Ausbau der Vertriebsaktivitäten von ColoAlert® in Europa,\n    * die Entwicklung seines Next-Generation-Tests zur Erkennung von Darmkrebs, und\n    * die Durchführung einer Studie mit 2.000 Patienten mit einem durchschnittlichen Risiko für Darmkrebs in den USA (eAArly-DETECT-2), deren Ergebnisse für das zweite Halbjahr 2025 erwartet werden. Das Unternehmen initiiert eAArly-DETECT-2 basierend auf dem jüngsten Feedback der FDA. Mit diesem erweiterten Datensatz, einschließlich einer größeren Patientengruppe mit durchschnittlichem Darmkrebsrisiko, plant Mainz Biomed die erneute Einreichung eines Antrags auf Breakthrough Device Designation.\n  * In Übereinstimmung mit diesen strategischen Initiativen hat Mainz Biomed seine Betriebsabläufe neu ausgerichtet und Kostensenkungen durchgeführt, vor allem im Bereich der Personal- und externen Beratungskosten.\n\n\n\n„2024 war für Mainz Biomed ein Jahr des Wandels. Während wir einigen Herausforderungen aufgrund des allgemein schwierigen Marktumfelds, insbesondere für Small-Cap-Technologieaktien, ausgesetzt waren, sind wir stolz darauf, dass wir bisher einige bedeutende Fortschritte erreichen konnten“, kommentierte Guido Baechler, CEO von Mainz Biomed. „Das Managementteam hat gemeinsam mit dem Aufsichtsrat unsere Wachstumspläne neu evaluiert. Wir sind überzeugt, dass wir mit einer stärkeren Fokussierung auf zentrale strategische Initiativen den Mehrwert für unsere Aktionäre und Aktionärinnen für den Rest des Jahres 2024 und darüber hinaus steigern können.“\n\n**_Zusammengefasste konsolidierte Finanzergebnisse (ungeprüft):_**\n\n![](https://mainzbiomed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DE-chart-1-891x1024.jpg)\n\n![](https://mainzbiomed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DE-Chart-2-789x1024.jpg)\n\n**Anmerkung: Bitte beachten Sie, dass die einzig offizielle Pressemitteilung, die vom Unternehmen in englischer Sprache veröffentlichte Fassung ist.
