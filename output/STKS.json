(“The ONE Group” or the\n“Company”) (Nasdaq: STKS) today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nHighlights for the third quarter 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 are as\nfollows (the prior year quarter excludes any contribution from the acquisition of Benihana\nInc. which closed in May 2024):\nTotal GAAP revenues increased 152.3% to $194.0 million from $76.9 million;\nComparable sales* decreased 8.8%;\nOperating loss was $3.0 million vs. $2.0 million and includes $7.1 million in transition,\ntransaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Benihana and\nRA Sushi;\nRestaurant Operating Profit** increased 175.6% to $25.1 million from $9.1 million;\nand\nRestaurant Operating Profit Margin** increased 90 basis points to 13.2% from\n12.3%\n“With the addition of Benihana and RA Sushi, we increased our revenue $117 million to a\nrecord $194 million as we continue to grow a scalable platform with exciting VIBE and\nentertainment centric dining brands. During the quarter, I was encouraged by our team’s\nability to manage costs effectively. Operating profit growth exceeded revenue growth as we\nimproved year-over-year margins at Benihana through supply chain synergies, benefitted\nfrom their higher margin contribution, and exhibited tight cost management within our\npreexisting business. Within the last sixty days we opened three Company-owned locations,\nall of which are off to terrific starts,” said Emanuel “Manny” Hilario, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer.\n“We are pleased with our progress in integrating Benihana and RA Sushi and have already\nimplemented $19 million in annual savings between eliminating duplicate administrative\ncosts and leveraging operational and supply chain synergies that will be realized over the\nnext year. Over the next two years, we expect additional efficiencies, bringing our total\nsavings to at least $20 million,” Hilario added.\n“We are laser focused on our balance sheet, finishing the quarter with strong liquidity of over\n$70 million. Looking ahead, we are beginning the next phase of growth and plan to open five\nto six Company-owned locations annually while focusing on the asset light development of\nmanaged and licensed STKs and Kona Grills and franchised Benihanas. We are prioritizing\nfree cash flow generation, balance sheet flexibility and maximizing shareholder returns,”\nHilario concluded.\n*Comparable sales represent total U.S. food and beverage sales at owned and managed\nunits, a non-GAAP financial measure, opened for at least a full 24-months. This measure\nincludes total revenue from our owned and managed locations. The Company monitors\nsales growth at its established restaurant base in addition to growth that results from\nrestaurant acquisitions and new restaurant openings. Refer to the reconciliation of GAAP\nrevenue to total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units in this press release.\n**We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net revenue minus owned\nrestaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant Operating\nProfit has been presented in this press release and is a supplemental measure of financial\nperformance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Refer to the\nreconciliation of Operating income to Restaurant Operating Profit in this press release.\nRestaurant Development\nSo far this year, we have opened five new Company-owned restaurants consisting of two\nSTKs, one Kona Grill, one RA Sushi and one Salt Water Social.\nAs of the date of this report, the following restaurants have opened this year:\nOwned STK restaurant in Washington DC March 2024\nOwned RA Sushi restaurant in Plantation, Florida July 2024\nOwned Kona Grill restaurant in Tigard, Oregon September 2024\nOwned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida October 2024\nOwned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado November 2024\nFor the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to open a managed STK in\nNiagara Falls.\nThere are currently two Company-owned STK restaurants and one Company-owned\nBenihana restaurant under construction that are expected to open in 2025. They are located\nin the following cities:\nOwned STK restaurant in Topanga, California\nOwned STK restaurant in Westwood, California (relocation of the existing STK)\nOwned Benihana restaurant in San Mateo, California\nAs part of the integration process between Kona Grill and RA Sushi, we are realizing\nsynergies by optimizing the restaurant portfolio and closed four RA Sushi locations in\nOctober, three of which were in markets with existing Kona Grills. We expect to retain a\nsignificant portion of the delivery and takeout business these restaurants generated through\nour nearby Kona Grill locations, supporting improved margins in our grill segment.\nLiquidity and Share Repurchase Program\nWe ended the quarter with $36.2 million in cash and short-term credit card receivables and\n$34.1 million available under its revolving credit facility. Under the current conditions, our\ncredit facility does not have any financial covenants.\nIn March 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a $5 million share repurchase program.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we spent $2.3 million for the repurchase of 0.6 million\nshares.\n2024 Targets\nWe are updating our 2024 targets, which are inclusive of the acquisition of Benihana.\nFinancial Results and Other Select Data 2024 Guidance 2024 Run\nUS$s in millions 1/1/2024-12/31/2024 Rate\nTotal GAAP revenues $660 to $680 $844 to $864\nConsolidated comparable sales for the fourth quarter -4% to -8%\nManaged, license and franchise fee revenues $15 to $16\nTotal owned operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net 83.0% to 83.6%\nrevenue\nConsolidated total G&A, excluding stock-based compensation Approx. $39\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA* $71 to $76 $111 to $116\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA* without pre-opening expenses $80 to $85 $120 to $125\nConsolidated restaurant pre-opening expenses $8 to $9\nConsolidated effective income tax rate Approx. 30%\nConsolidated total capital expenditures, net of allowances received by landlords $50 to $60\nConsolidated number of new system-wide venues Six\nDetail of 2024 Run Rate Revenue\n2024 Run Rate\nUS$s in millions\nTotal GAAP revenues guidance $660 to $680\nBenihana and RA Sushi revenue (January 1, 2024 – April 30, 2024) $170\nNew venue openings (208 store operating weeks)(1) $21\nClosed RA Sushi locations ($7)\nRun rate revenue $844 to $864\nDetail of 2024 Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA\n2024 Run Rate\nUS$s in millions\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA guidance $71 to $76\nBenihana and RA Sushi pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (January 1, 2024 – April 30, 2024) $22\nNew venue openings (208 store operating weeks)(1) $5\nClosed RA Sushi locations $1\nCaptured synergies to be realized in the next 12 months $12\nRun rate Adjusted EBITDA** $111 to 116\nPre-opening expenses $9\nRun rate Adjusted EBITDA** without pre-opening expenses $120 to $125\n_______________________\n(1) Includes one managed location opening in the fourth quarter of 2024\n*We have not reconciled guidance for Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measure because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling\nitems. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot\ndetermine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot\nbe reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period.\nAccordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are not available\nwithout unreasonable effort.\n**We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, non-cash rent expense,\nnon-recurring gains and losses, stock-based compensation, transaction and exit costs and\ntransition and integration expenses. Starting in Q3 2024, pre-opening expenses will no\nlonger be deducted from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this\npress release and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required\nby, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Refer to the reconciliation of Net Income to\nAdjusted EBITDA in this press release.\nConference Call and Webcast\nEmanuel “Manny” Hilario, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tyler Loy, Chief\nFinancial Officer, will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 412-542-4186.

In this press release, we also make references to the following non-\nGAAP financial measures: total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units,\nAdjusted EBITDA, Restaurant Operating Profit and Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units. Total food and beverage sales\nat owned and managed units represents our total revenue from our owned operations as\nwell as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we\nearn management and incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure\nrepresents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies total sales associated\nwith our brands and hospitality services that we provide. Accordingly, we include this non-\nGAAP measure so that investors can review financial data that management uses in\nevaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in\nassessing performance of restaurants and other services we operate, whether or not the\noperation is owned by us. However, because this measure is not determined in accordance\nwith GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these\nmeasures in the same manner. As a result, this measure as presented may not be directly\ncomparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. This non-GAAP\nmeasure is presented as supplemental information and not as an alternative to any GAAP\nmeasurements.

We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net\nrevenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses.\nWe believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results\nbecause: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-\nlevel productivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit\nas a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our\ncompetitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance\non a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our\nbusiness and to evaluate the performance of our restaurants.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Operating income to Restaurant Operating\nProfit for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the three months For the nine months ended\nended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income as reported $(3,020) $ (1,955) $ (1,986) $ 4,368\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue (3,388) (3,184) (10,348) (10,631)\nGeneral and administrative 12,785 7,280 30,941 22,803\nDepreciation and amortization 9,416 3,732 22,701 10,894\nTransaction and exit costs 850 — 9,199 —\nTransition and integration expenses 6,274 — 10,068 —\nPre-opening expenses 2,110 3,097 7,528 6,005\nOther expenses 46 128 78 480\nRestaurant Operating Profit $25,073 $ 9,098 $ 68,181 $ 33,919\nRestaurant Operating Profit as a percentage of owned restaurant net\nrevenue 13.2% 12.3% 15.5% 14.6%\nRestaurant Operating Profit by component is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the three For the nine months\nmonths ended ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) $ 6,547 $6,796 $26,769 $25,050\nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of STK revenue\n(Company owned) 14.6% 16.6% 18.4% 18.8%\nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) $ 17,708 $ — $34,442 $ —\nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of Benihana\nrevenue (Company owned) (1) 17.0% — 18.9% —\nGrill Concepts restaurant operating profit $ 1,602 $2,254 $ 8,271 $ 8,149\nGrill Concepts restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Grill Concepts revenue 4.4% 10.7% 8.3% 9.4%\nNon-core restaurant operating profit $ (783) $ 39 $(1,291) $ 39\nNon-core restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Non-core revenue (15.0)% 0.3% (9.8)% 0.3%\n_______________________\n(1) When adjusted for non-cash rent of $0.2 million and ($0.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September\n30, 2023, respectively, the Benihana restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Benihana revenue increased 20 basis points\nfrom 17.0% for the pro forma three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nAdjusted Net Income. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income before transaction and\nexit costs, transition and integration expenses, lease termination expenses, one-time stock-\nbased compensation, non-recurring costs and the income tax effect of any adjustments.\nWe believe that Adjusted Net Income is an appropriate measure of operating performance,\nas it provides a clear picture of our operating results by eliminating certain one-time\nexpenses that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. Adjusted Net\nIncome is included in this press release because it is a key metric used by management, and\nwe believe that it provides useful information facilitating performance comparisons from\nperiod to period. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and our\ncalculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly,\nyou should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported\nunder GAAP.\nFor the three months ended For the nine months\nSeptember 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income available to common stockholders as reported $ (16,015) $ (3,098) $ (29,551) $ 76\nAdjustments:\nTransaction and exit costs 850 — 9,199 —\nTransition and integration expenses 6,274 — 10,068 —\nLoss on early debt extinguishment — — 4,149 —\nOther expenses 46 128 78 480\nAdjusted net income before income taxes (8,845) (2,971) (76,057) 555\nIncome tax effect on adjustments(1) (538) (6) (1,762) (24)\nAdjusted net (loss) income available to common stockholders as\nreported $ (9,383) $ (2,977) $ (7,819) $ 531\nAdjusted net income per share: Basic $ (0.30) $ (0.09) $ (0.25) $ 0.02\nAdjusted net income per share: Diluted $ (0.30) $ (0.09) $ (0.25) $ 0.02\nShares used in computing basic income per share 31,008,275 31,515,011 31,256,946 31,657,761\nShares used in computing diluted income per share 31,008,275 31,515,011 31,256,946 32,537,572\n_______________________\n(1) Reflects the tax expense associated with the adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and\nSeptember 30, 2023.

(“The ONE Group” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: STKS) today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights for the third quarter 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 are as follows** _(the prior year quarter excludes any contribution from the acquisition of Benihana Inc. which closed in May 2024)_**:**\n\n  * **Total GAAP revenues** increased 152.3% to $194.0 million from $76.9 million;\n  * **Comparable sales*** decreased 8.8%;\n  * **Operating loss** was $3.0 million vs. $2.0 million and includes $7.1 million in transition, transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi;\n  * **Restaurant Operating Profit**** increased 175.6% to $25.1 million from $9.1 million; and\n  * **Restaurant Operating Profit Margin**** increased 90 basis points to 13.2% from 12.3%\n\n\n\n“With the addition of Benihana and RA Sushi, we increased our revenue $117 million to a record $194 million as we continue to grow a scalable platform with exciting VIBE and entertainment centric dining brands. During the quarter, I was encouraged by our team’s ability to manage costs effectively. Operating profit growth exceeded revenue growth as we improved year-over-year margins at Benihana through supply chain synergies, benefitted from their higher margin contribution, and exhibited tight cost management within our preexisting business. Within the last sixty days we opened three Company-owned locations, all of which are off to terrific starts,” said Emanuel “Manny” Hilario, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“We are pleased with our progress in integrating Benihana and RA Sushi and have already implemented $19 million in annual savings between eliminating duplicate administrative costs and leveraging operational and supply chain synergies that will be realized over the next year. Over the next two years, we expect additional efficiencies, bringing our total savings to at least $20 million,” Hilario added.\n\n“We are laser focused on our balance sheet, finishing the quarter with strong liquidity of over $70 million. Looking ahead, we are beginning the next phase of growth and plan to open five to six Company-owned locations annually while focusing on the asset light development of managed and licensed STKs and Kona Grills and franchised Benihanas. We are prioritizing free cash flow generation, balance sheet flexibility and maximizing shareholder returns,” Hilario concluded.\n\n_*Comparable sales represent total U.S. food and beverage sales at owned and managed units, a non-GAAP financial measure, opened for at least a full 24-months. This measure includes total revenue from our owned and managed locations. The Company monitors sales growth at its established restaurant base in addition to growth that results from restaurant acquisitions and new restaurant openings. Refer to the reconciliation of GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units in this press release._\n\n_**We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net revenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant Operating Profit has been presented in this press release and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Refer to the reconciliation of Operating income to Restaurant Operating Profit in this press release._\n\n**Restaurant Development**\n\nSo far this year, we have opened five new Company-owned restaurants consisting of two STKs, one Kona Grill, one RA Sushi and one Salt Water Social.\n\nAs of the date of this report, the following restaurants have opened this year:\n\nOwned STK restaurant in Washington DC |  March 2024  \n---|---  \nOwned RA Sushi restaurant in Plantation, Florida |  July 2024  \nOwned Kona Grill restaurant in Tigard, Oregon |  September 2024  \nOwned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida |  October 2024  \nOwned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado |  November 2024  \n  \nFor the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to open a managed STK in Niagara Falls.\n\nThere are currently two Company-owned STK restaurants and one Company-owned Benihana restaurant under construction that are expected to open in 2025. They are located in the following cities:\n\n  * Owned STK restaurant in Topanga, California\n  * Owned STK restaurant in Westwood, California (relocation of the existing STK)\n  * Owned Benihana restaurant in San Mateo, California\n\n\n\nAs part of the integration process between Kona Grill and RA Sushi, we are realizing synergies by optimizing the restaurant portfolio and closed four RA Sushi locations in October, three of which were in markets with existing Kona Grills. We expect to retain a significant portion of the delivery and takeout business these restaurants generated through our nearby Kona Grill locations, supporting improved margins in our grill segment.\n\n**Liquidity and Share Repurchase Program**\n\nWe ended the quarter with $36.2 million in cash and short-term credit card receivables and $34.1 million available under its revolving credit facility. Under the current conditions, our credit facility does not have any financial covenants.\n\nIn March 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a $5 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter of 2024, we spent $2.3 million for the repurchase of 0.6 million shares.\n\n**2024 Targets**\n\nWe are updating our 2024 targets, which are inclusive of the acquisition of Benihana.\n\n**Financial Results and Other Select Data** **_US$s in millions_** |  **2024 Guidance** **_1/1/2024-12/31/2024_** |  **2024 Run Rate**  \n---|---|---  \nTotal GAAP revenues |  $660 to $680 |  $844 to $864  \nConsolidated comparable sales for the fourth quarter |  -4% to -8%  \nManaged, license and franchise fee revenues |  $15 to $16  \nTotal owned operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue |  83.0% to 83.6%  \nConsolidated total G&A, excluding stock-based compensation |  Approx. $39  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA* |  $71 to $76 |  $111 to $116  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA* without pre-opening expenses |  $80 to $85 |  $120 to $125  \nConsolidated restaurant pre-opening expenses |  $8 to $9  \nConsolidated effective income tax rate |  Approx. 30%  \nConsolidated total capital expenditures, net of allowances received by landlords |  $50 to $60  \nConsolidated number of new system-wide venues |  Six  \n**Detail of 2024 Run Rate Revenue** **_US$s in millions_** |  **2024 Run Rate**  \n---|---  \nTotal GAAP revenues guidance |  $660 to $680  \nBenihana and RA Sushi revenue (January 1, 2024 – April 30, 2024) |  $170  \nNew venue openings (208 store operating weeks)(1) |  $21  \nClosed RA Sushi locations |  ($7)  \nRun rate revenue |  $844 to $864  \n**Detail of 2024 Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA** **_US$s in millions_** |  **2024 Run Rate**  \n---|---  \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA guidance |  $71 to $76  \nBenihana and RA Sushi pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (January 1, 2024 – April 30, 2024) |  $22  \nNew venue openings (208 store operating weeks)(1) |  $5  \nClosed RA Sushi locations |  $1  \nCaptured synergies to be realized in the next 12 months |  $12  \nRun rate Adjusted EBITDA** |  $111 to 116  \nPre-opening expenses |  $9  \nRun rate Adjusted EBITDA** without pre-opening expenses |  $120 to $125  \n_______________________  \n---  \n(1) |  Includes one managed location opening in the fourth quarter of 2024  \n  \n_*We have not reconciled guidance for Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measure because we do_ _not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we_ _cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted since_ _these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure_ _are not available without unreasonable effort._\n\n_**We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization,__non-cash impairment loss, non-cash rent expense, non-recurring gains and losses, stock-based compensation, transaction and exit_ _costs and transition and integration expenses. Starting in Q3 2024, pre-opening expenses will no longer be deducted from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this press release and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Refer to the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA in this press release._\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nEmanuel “Manny” Hilario, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tyler Loy, Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 412-542-4186.

In this press release, we also make references to the following non-GAAP financial measures: total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant Operating Profit and Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\n\n_Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units._ Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units represents our total revenue from our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure represents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies total sales associated with our brands and hospitality services that we provide. Accordingly, we include this non-GAAP measure so that investors can review financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing performance of restaurants and other services we operate, whether or not the operation is owned by us. However, because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, this measure as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. This non-GAAP measure is presented as supplemental information and not as an alternative to any GAAP measurements. The following table includes a reconciliation of our GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at our owned and managed units (in thousands):\n\n**For the three months ended September 30,** |  **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(unaudited)** |  **(unaudited)** |  **(unaudited)** |  **(unaudited)**  \nOwned restaurant net revenue (1) |  $ |  190,587 |  $ |  73,700 |  $ |  441,116 |  $ |  232,202  \nManagement, license, franchise and incentive fee revenue |  3,388 |  3,184 |  10,348 |  10,631  \nGAAP revenues |  $ |  193,975 |  $ |  76,884 |  $ |  451,464 |  $ |  242,833  \nFood and beverage sales from managed units (1) |  32,282 |  28,513 |  92,476 |  89,219  \nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units |  $ |  222,869 |  $ |  102,213 |  $ |  533,592 |  $ |  321,421  \n_______________________  \n---  \n(1) |  Components of total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units.  \n  \nThe following table presents the elements of the quarterly and annual Same Store Sales measure for 2023 and 2024:\n\n**2023 vs. 2022** |  **2024 vs. 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Q1** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **Q4** |  **YTD** |  **Q1** |  **Q2** |  **Q3**  \nUS STK Owned Restaurants |  1.0 |  % |  (10.1 |  )% |  (7.8 |  )% |  (6.5 |  )% |  (6.0 |  )% |  (6.0 |  )% |  (11.9 |  )% |  (11.4 |  )%  \nUS STK Managed Restaurants |  15.4 |  % |  2.5 |  % |  0.7 |  % |  0.7 |  % |  4.9 |  % |  (8.6 |  )% |  (7.4 |  )% |  (10.3 |  )%  \nUS STK Total Restaurants |  5.3 |  % |  (6.8 |  )% |  (5.5 |  )% |  (4.6 |  )% |  (3.0 |  )% |  (6.8 |  )% |  (10.6 |  )% |  (11.1 |  )%  \nBenihana Owned Restaurants |  (1.0 |  )% |  (4.2 |  )%  \nGrill Concept Owned Restaurants |  (4.3 |  %) |  (1.5 |  )% |  1.1 |  % |  (3.9 |  )% |  (2.2 |  )% |  (9.7 |  )% |  (13.0 |  )% |  (17.0 |  )%  \nCombined Same Store Sales |  1.6 |  % |  (4.7 |  )% |  (3.0 |  )% |  (4.3 |  )% |  (2.7 |  )% |  (7.9 |  )% |  (7.0 |  )% |  (8.8 |  )%  \n  \n_Adjusted EBITDA._ We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, non-cash rent expense, non-recurring gains and losses, stock-based compensation, certain transactional and exit costs and transition and integration expenses.

restaurant operating expenses.\n\nWe believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business and to evaluate the performance of our restaurants.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Operating income to Restaurant Operating Profit for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**For the three months ended September 30,** |  **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nOperating income as reported |  $ |  (3,020 |  ) |  $ |  (1,955 |  ) |  $ |  (1,986 |  ) |  $ |  4,368  \nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue |  (3,388 |  ) |  (3,184 |  ) |  (10,348 |  ) |  (10,631 |  )  \nGeneral and administrative |  12,785 |  7,280 |  30,941 |  22,803  \nDepreciation and amortization |  9,416 |  3,732 |  22,701 |  10,894  \nTransaction and exit costs |  850 |  — |  9,199 |  —  \nTransition and integration expenses |  6,274 |  — |  10,068 |  —  \nPre-opening expenses |  2,110 |  3,097 |  7,528 |  6,005  \nOther expenses |  46 |  128 |  78 |  480  \nRestaurant Operating Profit |  $ |  25,073 |  $ |  9,098 |  $ |  68,181 |  $ |  33,919  \nRestaurant Operating Profit as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue |  13.2 |  % |  12.3 |  % |  15.5 |  % |  14.6 |  %  \n  \nRestaurant Operating Profit by component is as follows (in thousands):\n\n**For the three months ended September 30,** |  **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) |  $ |  6,547 |  $ |  6,796 |  $ |  26,769 |  $ |  25,050  \nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of STK revenue (Company owned) |  14.6 |  % |  16.6 |  % |  18.4 |  % |  18.8 |  %  \nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) |  $ |  17,708 |  $ |  — |  $ |  34,442 |  $ |  —  \nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of Benihana revenue (Company owned) (1) |  17.0 |  % |  — |  18.9 |  % |  —  \nGrill Concepts restaurant operating profit |  $ |  1,602 |  $ |  2,254 |  $ |  8,271 |  $ |  8,149  \nGrill Concepts restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Grill Concepts revenue |  4.4 |  % |  10.7 |  % |  8.3 |  % |  9.4 |  %  \nNon-core restaurant operating profit |  $ |  (783 |  ) |  $ |  39 |  $ |  (1,291 |  ) |  $ |  39  \nNon-core restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Non-core revenue |  (15.0 |  )% |  0.3 |  % |  (9.8 |  )% |  0.3 |  %  \n_______________________  \n---  \n(1) |  When adjusted for non-cash rent of $0.2 million and ($0.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the Benihana restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Benihana revenue increased 20 basis points from 17.0% for the pro forma three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  \n  \n_Adjusted Net Income._ We define Adjusted Net Income as net income before transaction and exit costs, transition and integration expenses, lease termination expenses, one-time stock-based compensation, non-recurring costs and the income tax effect of any adjustments.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted Net Income is an appropriate measure of operating performance, as it provides a clear picture of our operating results by eliminating certain one-time expenses that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. Adjusted Net Income is included in this press release because it is a key metric used by management, and we believe that it provides useful information facilitating performance comparisons from period to period. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**For the three months ended September 30,** |  **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet (loss) income available to common stockholders as reported |  $ |  (16,015 |  ) |  $ |  (3,098 |  ) |  $ |  (29,551 |  ) |  $ |  76  \nAdjustments:  \nTransaction and exit costs |  850 |  — |  9,199 |  —  \nTransition and integration expenses |  6,274 |  — |  10,068 |  —  \nLoss on early debt extinguishment |  — |  — |  4,149 |  —  \nOther expenses |  46 |  128 |  78 |  480  \nAdjusted net income before income taxes |  (8,845 |  ) |  (2,971 |  ) |  (76,057 |  ) |  555  \nIncome tax effect on adjustments(1) |  (538 |  ) |  (6 |  ) |  (1,762 |  ) |  (24 |  )  \nAdjusted net (loss) income available to common stockholders as reported |  $ |  (9,383 |  ) |  $ |  (2,977 |  ) |  $ |  (7,819 |  ) |  $ |  531  \nAdjusted net income per share: Basic |  $ |  (0.30 |  ) |  $ |  (0.09 |  ) |  $ |  (0.25 |  ) |  $ |  0.02  \nAdjusted net income per share: Diluted |  $ |  (0.30 |  ) |  $ |  (0.09 |  ) |  $ |  (0.25 |  ) |  $ |  0.02  \nShares used in computing basic income per share |  31,008,275 |  31,515,011 |  31,256,946 |  31,657,761  \nShares used in computing diluted income per share |  31,008,275 |  31,515,011 |  31,256,946 |  32,537,572  \n_______________________  \n---  \n(1) |  Reflects the tax expense associated with the adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.

HOSPITALITY, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 – Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is an international restaurant company that develops, owns and operates, manages and licenses upscale and polished casual, high-energy\nrestaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services and consulting services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations. Turn-key F&B services are food and\nbeverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by the Company at a particular hospitality venue and customized for the client. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s primary restaurant brands are STK, a\nmodern twist on the American steakhouse concept featuring premium steaks, seafood and specialty cocktails in an energetic upscale atmosphere, Benihana, an interactive dining destination with highly skilled chefs preparing food\nin front of guests and served in an energetic atmosphere alongside fresh sushi and innovative cocktails, Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty\ncocktails in a polished casual atmosphere, and RA Sushi, a Japanese cuisine concept that offers a fun-filled, bar-forward, upbeat, and vibrant dining atmosphere anchored by creative sushi, inventive drinks, and outstanding\nservice.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Safflower Holdings Corp. from Safflower Holdings LLC (the “Benihana Acquisition”). Safflower Holdings Corp. beneficially\nowns most of the Benihana restaurants, as well as all of the RA Sushi restaurants, in the United States. It also franchises Benihana locations in the U.S., Latin America (excluding Mexico) and the Caribbean. Refer to Note 2 –\nBenihana Acquisition for additional information.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company owned, operated, managed, franchised, or licensed 168 venues, including 28 STKs, 85 Benihanas, 27 Kona Grills and 20 RA Sushis in major metropolitan cities in North America,\nEurope, Latin America and the Middle East and 8 F&B venues in four hotels and casinos in the United States and Europe. For those restaurants and venues that are managed, licensed or franchised, the Company generates\nmanagement fees and franchise fees based on top-line revenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the location’s revenues and profits.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements (“condensed consolidated financial statements”) of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual audited financial statements have been omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. These\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nIn the Company’s opinion, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the\ninterim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. Additionally, the Company believes that the disclosures are sufficient for interim\nfinancial reporting purposes.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 have been made to conform to current year presentation. The Company has reclassified credit card receivables of $7.2 million to\nbe presented within credit card receivables from accounts receivable.\nCertain reclassifications were also made to conform the prior period segment reporting to the current year segment presentation. Refer to Note 15 – Segment Reporting for additional information regarding the Company’s\nreportable operating segments.\nCertain reclassifications were also made to align our international revenues and long-term assets with the Company’s classification of domestic and international venues.\n8\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRefer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Company’s significant accounting policies. The following represents changes in accounting policies during 2024, primarily\nattributable to the evaluation of accounting policies in conjunction with the Benihana acquisition discussed below:\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are accounts that are restricted to funding payment of employee benefits and collateral accounts relating to liquor license bonds.\nGoodwill. Goodwill consists of goodwill associated with the Benihana Acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually on November 1st or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicated a potential impairment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure.” The ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through\nrequiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.\nThe Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The ASU includes amendments requiring enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to\nstandardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The\nCompany is evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its disclosures.\nNote 2 – Benihana Acquisition\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Safflower Holdings Corp. and its affiliates comprising of 93 company owned restaurants and 12 franchised restaurants (the\n“Benihana Acquisition”). The Company purchased the equity for a contractual price of $365.0 million, subject to customary adjustments. The Company believes that Benihana is complementary to its existing brands and will\nenable the Company to capture market share in the Vibe Dining segment.\nThe assets and liabilities of Benihana were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The Company is in the process of finalizing the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired. Since the\ninitial valuation, the Company adjusted the fair values for cash and cash equivalents by ($0.1) million, other current assets by $0.2 million, property and equipment by ($0.5) million, operating lease right-of-use assets by $1.2\nmillion, deferred tax assets by $3.2 million, intangible assets by ($13.1) million, goodwill by $10.2 million, accrued expenses by $0.9 million, other current liabilities by ($2.2) million, and operating lease liabilities by $1.2\nmillion to reflect the current fair value valuation and alignment with the Company’s accounting policies. The fair values set forth below are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to change as additional information is\nobtained during the measurement period which is up to one year from acquisition date (amounts in thousands).\n9\nTable of Contents\nPurchase consideration:\nContractual purchase price $ 365,000\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and credit card receivable 25,117\nWorking capital adjustment 1,151\nCash consideration paid 391,268\nNet assets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 20,879\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 551\nCredit card receivable 3,687\nInventory 4,405\nOther current assets 7,471\nProperty and equipment 102,552\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 182,346\nDeferred tax assets, net 29,991\nIntangible assets 117,800\nOther assets 2,899\nAccounts payable (9,851)\nAccrued expenses (30,074)\nOther current liabilities (3,134)\nOperating lease liabilities (189,181)\nOther long-term liabilities (4,404)\nTotal net assets acquired 235,937\nGoodwill $ 155,331\nThe excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents benefits expected because of the\nacquisition, including sales and unit growth opportunities in addition to supply-chain and support-cost synergies. The Benihana and RA Sushi tradenames have an indefinite life based on the expected use of the asset and the\nregulatory and economic environment within which it is being used. The tradenames represent highly respected brands with positive connotations, and the Company intends to cultivate and protect the use of the brands. Goodwill\nand indefinite-lived tradenames are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\nAs a result of the Benihana Acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million and $8.7 million of transaction costs, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are included\nin transaction and exit costs in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Credit Agreement provides a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $40.0 million\nsenior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”, and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”), up to $10.0 million of which will be available in the form of letters of credit. On May 1, 2024, the\nCompany borrowed $350.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility was and remains undrawn.\nThe Term Loan Facility is not subject to a financial covenant and the Revolving Facility’s financial covenant will apply only after 35% of the Revolving Facility’s capacity has been drawn.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Term Loan Facility bears interest at a margin over a reference rate selected at the option of the borrower. The margin for the Term Loan Facility is 6.5% per annum for SOFR borrowings and 5.5% per annum for base rate\nborrowings. The Term Loan Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the date of the related loan agreement. The Term Loan Facility is payable in quarterly installments commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30,\n2024, and are 1% per annum for the first year (through June 30, 2025), then 2.5% per annum for the next two years (through June 2027), then 5% per annum thereafter through maturity on April 30, 2029.\nThe Revolving Facility bears interest at a margin over a reference rate selected at the option of the borrower. The margin for the Revolving Facility is set quarterly based on the Company’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio\nfor the preceding four fiscal quarters and ranges from 5.5% to 6.0% per annum for SOFR borrowings and 4.5% to 5.0% for base rate borrowings. The Revolving Facility matures on November 1, 2028.\nThe Company’s weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit and Guarantee Agreement as of September 30, 2024 was 11.83%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.6 million of debt issuance costs and $14.3 million of debt original issuance discount related to the Credit Agreement, which were capitalized and are recorded as a direct\ndeduction to long-term debt and less than $0.1 million in debt issuance costs and $1.7 million of debt original issuance discount recorded in Other Assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Extinguishment\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into the credit agreement with Goldman Sachs, which was replaced with the Credit Agreement described above on May 1, 2024. The Goldman Sachs credit agreement provided for a\nsecured revolving credit facility of $12.0 million, a $25.0 million term loan and a $50.0 million delayed draw term loan. On May 1, 2024, the outstanding loan balance was repaid and the unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.7\nmillion and fees incurred of $2.4 million were recognized as a loss on early debt extinguishment on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Long-lived assets are measured and disclosed at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis if an impairment is identified. There were no long-lived assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s long-term debt, including the current portion, is carried at cost on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, is valued using Level 2 inputs\nincluding current applicable rates for similar instruments and approximates the carrying value of such obligations.\nThe Company’s purchase price allocations for the Benihana Acquisition were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using Level 3 inputs.\nNote 8 – Income Taxes\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has computed its interim tax provision using the estimated annual effective tax rate method. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had elected\nto compute its interim tax provision using the actual year-to-date effective tax rate method as small changes in projected income could have produced large variations in the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate. The\nCompany recorded a benefit for income taxes of $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 30.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the\nstatutory U.S. tax rate of 21% primarily due to the following: (i) tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees’ tips (ii) taxes owed in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate; (iii) taxes owed in\nstate and local jurisdictions; (iv) transaction costs associated with the Benihana Acquisition; and (v) the tax effect of non-deductible compensation. The income tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 included the discrete period tax benefits resulting from the vesting of restricted stock units.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and various foreign income taxes for the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Turn-key F&B services are food and beverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by us\nfor the client at a particular hospitality venue. Our vision is to be a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance, high-energy and cuisine into one great experience that we refer to as\n“Vibe Dining”. We design all our restaurants, lounges and F&B services to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy\nseparates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors.\nOur primary restaurant brands are as follows:\n● STK, a modern twist on the American steakhouse concept featuring premium steaks, seafood and specialty cocktails in an energetic upscale atmosphere;\n● Benihana, an interactive dining destination with highly skilled chefs preparing food in front of guests and served in an energetic atmosphere alongside fresh sushi and innovative cocktails;\n● Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere; and\n● RA Sushi, a Japanese cuisine concept that offers a fun-filled, bar-forward, upbeat, and vibrant dining atmosphere anchored by creative sushi, inventive drinks, and outstanding service.\nOur F&B hospitality management services are marketed as ONE Hospitality and include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms,\nroom service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. We also provide hospitality advisory and consulting services to certain clients. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands\nsuch as the W Hotel, ME Hotel and Hippodrome Casino. For those restaurants and venues that are managed, licensed or franchised, we generate management fee revenue and franchise revenue based on top-line revenues and\nincentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the location’s revenues and net profits.\nWe opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York, New York. We currently own, operate, manage, license or franchise 166 venues including 29 STKs, 85 Benihanas, 27 Kona Grills and 16 RA Sushi in major cities\nin North America, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and 9 F&B venues operated under ONE Hospitality in four hotels and casinos throughout the United States and Europe.\nAs our footprint increases, we expect to benefit by leveraging system-wide operating efficiencies and best practices through the management of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of overall revenue.\nWe intend to open six new venues in 2024. As of the date of this report we have opened the following:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Washington DC\n● Owned RA Sushi restaurant in Plantation, Florida\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Tigard, Oregon\n● Owned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida\n22\nTable of Contents\n● Owned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado\nThere are currently two Company-owned STK restaurants and one Company-owned Benihana restaurant under construction in the following cities:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Topanga, California\n● Owned STK restaurant in Los Angeles, California\n● Owned Benihana restaurant in San Mateo, California\nIn July 2024, we terminated a franchise agreement for one restaurant.\nIn October 2024, we closed four company-owned RA Sushi restaurants.\nThe table below reflects our current venues by restaurant brand and geographic location:\nVenues\nSTK(1) Benihana(3) Kona Grill RA Sushi ONE Hospitality(2) Total\nDomestic\nOwned 18 74 27 16 3 138\nManaged 2 — — — 1 3\nLicensed 1 — — — — 1\nFranchised — 8 — — — 8\nTotal domestic 21 82 27 16 4 150\nInternational\nOwned — — — — 1 1\nManaged 4 — — — 4 8\nLicensed 4 — — — — 4\nFranchised — 3 — — — 3\nTotal international 8 3 — — 5 16\nTotal venues 29 85 27 16 9 166\n(1) Locations with an STK and STK Rooftop are considered one venue location.

The Credit Agreement provides a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, up to $10.0\nmillion of which will be available in the form of letters of credit. On May 1, 2024, we borrowed $350.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility was and remains undrawn.\nRefer to Notes 6 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the new credit facility and preferred stock financing.\nKey Performance Indicators\nRefer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Company’s key performance indicators. The following represents changes in key performance indicators during 2024,\nprimarily attributable to the evaluation of accounting policies in conjunction with the Benihana acquisition discussed below:\nSame Store Sales (“SSS”). SSS represents total food and beverage sales at domestic owned and managed restaurants opened for at least a full 24-month period at the beginning of each quarter, which removes the impact of\nnew restaurant openings and closures in comparing the operations of existing restaurants. For STK SSS, this measure includes total revenue from our owned and managed domestic STK locations, excluding revenues from our\nowned STK restaurant located in the W Hotel in Los Angeles, California due to the impact of the F&B hospitality management agreement with the hotel. Revenues from locations where we do not directly control the event sales\nforce are excluded from this measure.\nExecutive Summary\nTotal revenues increased $117.1 million, or 152.3% to $194.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $76.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Benihana\nAcquisition on May 1, 2024. Same store sales decreased 8.8% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nOperating loss increased $1.0 million to $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily attributed to\ntransaction, transition and integration costs related to the Benihana Acquisition partially offset by the increase in operating income attributable to the acquired restaurants.\nRestaurant operating profit increased $16.0 million, or 175.6% to $25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\nrestaurant operating profit is primarily due to the Benihana Acquisition on May 1, 2024, strong restaurant operating profit for new STK restaurants and cost reduction initiatives. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of\nowned restaurant net revenue was 13.2% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 12.3%\n24\nTable of Contents\nin the third quarter of 2023.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant\nOperating Profit are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We have evolved our definition of Adjusted EBITDA starting in the third\nquarter of 2024 to provide more clarity and comparability relative to peers. We will exclude pre-opening expenses as an add back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Prior period amounts presented in the table below have been\nrecast to conform to the current period presentation.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, non-cash rent expense, transaction and exit costs, transition and integration expenses, stock-based compensation, and non-recurring gains and losses. Not all of the items defining Adjusted EBITDA\noccur in each reporting period but have been included in our definitions of these terms based on our historical activity. We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net revenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales\nand owned restaurant operating expenses.\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are appropriate measures of our operating performance because they eliminate non-cash or non-recurring expenses that do not reflect our\nunderlying business performance. We believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level\nproductivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison\nof our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business and to evaluate the performance of our restaurants. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an\nanalytical tool and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported\nunder GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate\ncompanies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit, alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, to measure profitability, as a key profitability target in our budgets, and to compare our\nperformance against that of peer companies despite possible differences in calculation.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ (8,890) $ (3,098) $ (17,888) $ 76\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (165) (155) (689) (583)\nNet loss (9,055) (3,253) (18,577) (507)\nInterest expense, net 10,679 1,673 20,622 5,102\nBenefit for income taxes (4,644) (375) (8,180) (227)\nDepreciation and amortization 9,416 3,732 22,701 10,894\nEBITDA 6,396 1,777 16,566 15,262\nStock-based compensation 1,580 1,244 4,433 3,798\nTransaction and exit costs 850 — 9,199 —\nTransition and integration expenses 6,274 — 10,068 —\nNon-cash rent expense (1) (343) (126) (1,034) (279)\nLoss on early debt extinguishment — — 4,149 —\nOther expenses 46 128 78 480\nAdjusted EBITDA 14,803 3,023 43,459 19,261\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest (54) (72) (387) (326)\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 14,857 $ 3,096 $ 43,846 $ 19,588\n(1) Non-cash rent expense is included in owned restaurant operating expenses and general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Operating (loss) income to Restaurant Operating Profit for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income as reported $ (3,020) $ (1,955) $ (1,986) $ 4,368\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue (3,388) (3,184) (10,348) (10,631)\nGeneral and administrative 12,785 7,280 30,941 22,803\nDepreciation and amortization 9,416 3,732 22,701 10,894\nTransaction and exit costs 850 — 9,199 —\nTransition and integration expenses 6,274 — 10,068 —\nPre-opening expenses 2,110 3,097 7,528 6,005\nOther expenses 46 128 78 480\nRestaurant Operating Profit $ 25,073 $ 9,098 $ 68,181 $ 33,919\nRestaurant Operating Profit as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue 13.2% 12.3% 15.5% 14.6%\n28\nTable of Contents\nRestaurant operating profit by component is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) $ 6,547 $ 6,796 $ 26,769 $ 25,050\nSTK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of STK revenue (Company owned) 14.6% 16.6% 18.4% 18.8%\nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) $ 17,708 $ — $ 34,442 $ —\nBenihana restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of Benihana revenue (Company owned) (1) 17.0% — 18.9% —\nCore Grill Concepts restaurant operating profit $ 1,602 $ 2,254 $ 8,271 $ 8,149\nCore Grill Concepts restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Grill Concepts revenue 4.4% 10.7% 8.3% 9.4%\nNon-core Grill Concepts restaurant operating profit $ (783) $ 39 $ (1,291) $ 39\nNon-core Grill Concepts restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Non-core revenue (15.0)% 0.3% (9.8)% 0.3%\n(1) When adjusted for non-cash rent of $0.2 million and ($0.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the Benihana restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Benihana revenue increased 20 basis points from 17.0% for the\npro forma three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n29\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenues\nOwned restaurant net revenue. Owned restaurant net revenue increased $116.9 million, or 158.6%, to $190.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $73.7 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants on May 1, 2024, which generated $119.4 million in revenues and $10.1 million in revenues from six new restaurants\nopened since October 2023, partially offset by a reduction in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 8.8% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue. Management, license and incentive fee revenues increased $0.2 million, or 6.4%, to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $3.2 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Management, license and incentive fee revenue attributed to Benihana franchised restaurants contributed $0.7 million in revenues during the third quarter of 2024 which was offset by decreased\nrevenues at our managed STK restaurants in North America and early termination of the STK Westminster management agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we consolidated our operations in London, UK.\nCost and Expenses\nOwned restaurant cost of sales. Food and beverage costs for owned restaurants increased $21.7 million, or 118.8%, to $39.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $18.2 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase in owned restaurant cost of sales is primarily attributed to $23.2 million in cost of sales associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1,\n2024. As a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue, cost of sales decreased 380 basis points from 24.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due\nto lower cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales for Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants as compared to STK and Kona Grill restaurants, product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\nOwned restaurant operating expenses. Owned restaurant operating expenses increased $79.2 million to $125.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $46.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in owned restaurant operating expense is primarily attributed to $77.7 million in operating expenses associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May\n1, 2024. Owned restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue increased 300 basis points from 62.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 65.9% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative costs increased $5.5 million, or 75.6%, to $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was attributable to incremental headcount associated with the Benihana Acquisition and increased stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs were 6.6%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease was primarily related to depreciation and amortization for the Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024, depreciation associated with the opening of six new owned venues since October 2023 and\ncapital expenditures to maintain and enhance the guest experience in our restaurants.\nPre-opening expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $2.1 million of pre-opening expenses primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Tigard, which opened\non September 17, 2024, and STK Aventura, which opened in October 2024. We also incurred costs during the third quarter of 2024 for STK, Benihana and Kona Grill restaurants currently under development. Total pre-opening\nexpenses related to non-cash pre-open rent was $0.3 million.\nPre-opening expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $3.1 million, primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Riverton, which opened in July 2023, and STK and\nKona Grill restaurants that were under development. Detail of pre-opening expenses by category is provided in the table below for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).\n30\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Preopen Expenses Preopen Rent (2) Total\nTraining Team $ 1,116 $ — $ 1,116\nRestaurants (1) 549 445 994\nTotal $ 1,665 $ 445 $ 2,110\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023 Preopen Expenses Preopen Rent (2) Total\nTraining Team $ 1,562 $ — $ 1,562\nRestaurants 1,071 464 1,535\nTotal $ 2,633 $ 464 $ 3,097\n(1) Includes Salt Water Social, STK Aventura, Kona Grill Tigard, RA Sushi Plantation and other venues under development.\n(2) Cash rent paid was $202 and $64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTransaction and exit costs. Transaction and exit costs were $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These costs primarily included investment banking, legal and professional fees incurred in conjunction\nwith the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024.\nTransition and integration costs. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $6.3 million of transition and integration costs associated with the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024. Included\nin these costs are expenses related to the implementation of happy hour and wagyu offerings at Benihana and identified duplicate professional service vendors, operational support offices, support positions, and maintenance\nexpenses that will be eliminated in the foreseeable future. Over the next twelve months, we intend to integrate Benihana by leveraging our corporate infrastructure, our supply chain, and unique Vibe Dining program, to elevate\nthe brand experience and drive improved performance.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $10.7 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We borrowed $350.0 million on the Credit Agreement on May 1, 2024 to\nfinance the Benihana Acquisition. The weighted average interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.8% compared to 12.1% in the same period of 2023.\nBenefit for income taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax benefit was $4.6 million compared to income tax benefit of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenues\nOwned restaurant net revenue. Owned restaurant net revenue increased $208.9 million, or 90.0%, to $441.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $232.2 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants on May 1, 2024, which generated $208.1 million in revenues for the five-month period owned by the Company, and $32.6\nmillion in revenues from six new restaurants opened since October 2023, partially offset by a reduction in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.9% during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue. Management, license and incentive fee revenues decreased $0.3 million, or 2.7%, to $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $10.6 million for the\nnine months September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased revenues at our STK restaurants in North America and early termination of the STK Westminster management agreement in the fourth\nquarter of 2023 as we consolidated our operations in London, UK, partially offset by $1.1 million in revenues attributed to Benihana franchised restaurants.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCost and Expenses\nOwned restaurant cost of sales. Food and beverage costs for owned restaurants increased $38.2 million, or 67.8%, to $94.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $56.3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was due to the incremental sales increases noted above from the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi and the opening of six new venues since September 2023,\npartially offset by product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\nAs a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue, cost of sales improved 280 basis points from 24.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to\nlower cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales for Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants as compared to STK and Kona Grill restaurants, product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\nOwned restaurant operating expenses. Owned restaurant operating expenses increased $136.5 million to $278.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $142.0 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 The increase in owned restaurant operating expense is primarily attributed to $131.5 million in operating expenses associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May\n1, 2024. Owned restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue increased 200 basis points from 61.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 63.1% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative costs increased $8.1 million, or 35.7%, to $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was attributable to incremental headcount associated with the Benihana Acquisition and increased stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs were 6.9%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $22.7 million and $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily related to five\nmonths of depreciation and amortization for the Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024, depreciation associated with the six new owned venues opened since October 2023 and capital expenditures to\nmaintain and enhance the guest experience in our restaurants.\nPre-opening expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $7.5 million of pre-opening expenses primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for STK Washington DC, which\nopened in March 2024, RA Sushi Plantation which opened on July 1, 2024, Kona Grill Tigard which opened in September 2024, and STK Aventura which opened in October 2024. Total pre-opening expenses related to non-cash\npre-open rent was $0.9 million.\nPre-opening expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $6.0 million primarily related to payroll, training, and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Columbus and Kona Grill Riverton, which opened in\nJanuary 2023 and July 2023, respectively, and STK Charlotte and Kona Grill Phoenix, which opened in October 2023, and STK and Kona Grill restaurants under development.

Transaction and exit costs were $9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These costs primarily included investment banking, legal and professional fees incurred in conjunction\nwith the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024.\n32\nTable of Contents\nTransition and integration costs. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $10.1 million of transition and integration costs associated with the Benihana and RA Sushi acquisition, which closed on May 1,\n2024. Included in these costs are expenses related to the implementation of happy hour and wagyu offerings at Benihana and identified duplicate professional service vendors, operational support offices, support positions, and\nmaintenance expenses that will be eliminated in the foreseeable future. Over the next twelve months, we intend to integrate Benihana by leveraging our corporate infrastructure, our supply chain, and unique Vibe Dining program,\nto elevate the brand experience and drive improved performance.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We borrowed $350.0 million on the\nCredit Agreement on May 1, 2024 to finance the Benihana Acquisition. The weighted average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.8% compared to 11.8% in the same period of 2023.\nLoss on early debt extinguishment. On May 1, 2024, in conjunction with entering into the Credit Agreement, we prepaid the outstanding debt balance under the credit agreement with Goldman Sachs to early extinguish the\n$73.1 million of outstanding term loans. We recognized a $4.1 million loss on debt extinguishment primarily caused by the prepayment penalty and the recognition of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the debt\nextinguished.\nBenefit for income taxes. The benefit for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.2 million compared to a benefit for income taxes of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $0.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nExecutive Summary\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our lease obligations, working capital and capital expenditure needs and to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt. Subject to our operating performance, which, if\nsignificantly adversely affected, would adversely affect the availability of funds, we expect to finance our operations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future, including the costs of opening currently planned new\nrestaurants, through cash provided by operations and construction allowances provided by landlords of certain locations. We also may borrow on our revolving credit facility or issue equity, including preferred stock, to support\nongoing business operations. We believe these sources of financing are adequate to support our immediate business operations and plans. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash\nequivalents of $28.7 million and $349.1 million in long-term debt, which consisted of borrowings under our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the availability on our revolving credit facility was $34.1 million, subject\nto certain conditions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures were $53.8 million of which $43.0 million related to the construction of new STK, Benihana, Kona Grill and RA Sushi restaurants and $10.7 million\nrelated to existing restaurants. Net capital expenditures, inclusive of $4.7 million in landlord contributions, was $49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to receive between $3.0 million to $4.0\nmillion in landlord contributions in the next three months.

Revenues are received primarily in credit card or cash receipts, and\nrestaurant operations do not require significant receivables or inventories, other than our wine inventory. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies, thereby reducing the need for\nincremental working capital to support growth. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter.\nOur future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of expansion, conditions in the retail property development market, construction costs, the nature of the specific sites selected for new\nrestaurants, and the nature of the specific leases and associated tenant improvement allowances available, if any, as negotiated with landlords. We have made significant investments in our training and development teams to\nsupport new restaurants openings. We believe these investments are necessary to support the successful opening of our new restaurants. If we modify our growth plans, the personnel that comprise our training team could be\ndeployed to operate existing restaurants.\nTo help manage future cash requirements, we limit the number of owned company venues under construction at any given time to six restaurants. We also set a maximum number of signed leases for new restaurant\ndevelopment to twelve in order to minimize our cash rent commitment to approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million annually for restaurants under development.\nCapital Expenditures and Lease Arrangements\nWhen we open new Company-owned restaurants, our capital expenditures for construction increase. For owned STK restaurants, where we build from a shell state, we have typically targeted a restaurant size of 8,000 square\nfeet with a gross cash investment of approximately $515 to $675 per square foot, exclusive of $200 per square foot in landlord contributions. For owned Kona Grill restaurants, where we build from a shell state, we have typically\ntargeted a restaurant size of 7,000 square feet with a gross cash investment of approximately $510 per square foot, exclusive of $150 per square foot in landlord contributions. In situations where we add functional space and build\nan STK or Kona Grill restaurant with a mezzanine, covered patio, or rooftop, costs per square foot will increase. Typical cash pre-opening costs are $0.6 million to $0.8 million, excluding the impact of cash and non-cash pre-\nopening rent. In addition, some of our existing restaurants will require capital improvements to either maintain or improve the facilities. We may add seating or provide enclosures for outdoor space in the next twelve months for\nsome of our locations, when we believe that will increase revenues for those locations.\nOur hospitality F&B venues typically require limited capital investment from us. Capital expenditures for these projects will primarily be funded by cash flows from operations depending upon the timing of these\nexpenditures and cash availability.\nWe typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for periods of 10 to 20 years under operating lease arrangements, with a limited number of renewal options. Our rent structure varies, but our leases generally provide for the\npayment of both minimum and contingent rent based on sales, as well as other expenses related to the leases such as our pro-rata share of common area maintenance, property tax and insurance expenses. Many of our lease\narrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants. Generally, landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased\nminimum rents. However, there can be no assurance that such allowances will be available to us on each project that we select for development.\nCredit Agreement\nRefer to Note 6 and Note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the terms of our long-term debt arrangements and\ninformation regarding our commitments and contingencies.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 25,668 $ 15,228\nInvesting activities (423,606) (38,411)\nFinancing activities 405,565 (9,681)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 10 (120)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 7,637 $ (32,984)\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net\ncash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of collections on accounts receivables and payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $423.6 million, which was comprised of $369.8 million for the Benihana acquisition, net of cash acquired, and\n$53.8 million in capital expenditures for the construction of STK Washington DC, which opened in March 2024, RA Sushi Plantation, which opened in July 2024, Kona Grill Tigard, which opened in September 2024, and STK\nAventura, which opened in October 2024, in addition to residual payments on four restaurants that opened during the fourth quarter of 2023 and several restaurants that were under development as of September 30, 2024.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $38.4 million primarily for the construction of STK restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Salt Lake City,\nUtah and Washington D.C. and Kona Grill restaurants in Columbus, Ohio; Riverton, Utah and Phoenix, Arizona and several restaurants that were under development as of September 30, 2023, as well as capital expenditures for\nexisting restaurants.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $405.6 million and was comprised of net proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $333.8\nmillion and net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants of $138.9 million, partially offset by the repayment of the Goldman Sachs debt of $73.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $9.7 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which reflected $7.7 million in common stock purchased under our share repurchase program and $1.8 million in tax withholding obligation on stock-based compensation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the recent\naccounting pronouncements discussed in Note 1 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nAs a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\nand Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\n35\nTable of Contents\ndesired control objectives, as our controls are designed to do, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the risk and cost benefit relationship related to controls and procedures.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nOn May 1, 2024, we completed the Benihana Acquisition and have implemented new processes and internal controls to assist us in the preparation and disclosure of financial information. Given the significance of the\nBenihana Acquisition, we intend to exclude the acquired Benihana business from our assessment and report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. Other than discussed above, there\nhave been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrols over financial reporting.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are subject to claims common to our industry and in the ordinary course of our business. Companies in our industry, including us, have been and are subject to class action lawsuits, primarily regarding compliance with\nlabor laws and regulations. Defending lawsuits requires significant management attention and financial resources and the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. We believe that accrual and disclosure for these matters\nare adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements. We do not believe the ultimate resolutions of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nHowever, the resolution of lawsuits is difficult to predict. A significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than is currently anticipated, could\nmaterially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIn September 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $10.0 million of outstanding common stock. In May 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $5.0\nmillion to this program. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased 2.3 million shares for $15.0 million under the program. In March 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $5.0 million of\nrepurchases under this program.

Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nNote 1 – Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is an international restaurant company that develops, owns and operates, manages and licenses upscale and polished casual, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services and consulting services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations. Turn-key F&B services are food and beverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by the Company at a particular hospitality venue and customized for the client. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s primary restaurant brands are STK, a modern twist on the American steakhouse concept featuring premium steaks, seafood and specialty cocktails in an energetic upscale atmosphere, Benihana, an interactive dining destination with highly skilled chefs preparing food in front of guests and served in an energetic atmosphere alongside fresh sushi and innovative cocktails, Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere, and RA Sushi, a Japanese cuisine concept that offers a fun-filled, bar-forward, upbeat, and vibrant dining atmosphere anchored by creative sushi, inventive drinks, and outstanding service.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Safflower Holdings Corp. from Safflower Holdings LLC (the “Benihana Acquisition”). Safflower Holdings Corp. beneficially owns most of the Benihana restaurants, as well as all of the RA Sushi restaurants, in the United States. It also franchises Benihana locations in the U.S., Latin America (excluding Mexico) and the Caribbean. Refer to Note 2 – Benihana Acquisition for additional information.\n\n​\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company owned, operated, managed, franchised, or licensed 168 venues, including 28 STKs, 85 Benihanas, 27 Kona Grills and 20 RA Sushis in major metropolitan cities in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and 8 F&B venues in four hotels and casinos in the United States and Europe. For those restaurants and venues that are managed, licensed or franchised, the Company generates management fees and franchise fees based on top-line revenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the location’s revenues and profits.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (“condensed consolidated financial statements”) of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual audited financial statements have been omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the Company’s opinion, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. Additionally, the Company believes that the disclosures are sufficient for interim financial reporting purposes.\n\n_Prior Period Reclassifications_\n\nCertain reclassifications of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 have been made to conform to current year presentation. The Company has reclassified credit card receivables of $7.2 million to be presented within credit card receivables from accounts receivable.\n\nCertain reclassifications were also made to conform the prior period segment reporting to the current year segment presentation. Refer to Note 15 – Segment Reporting for additional information regarding the Company’s reportable operating segments.\n\nCertain reclassifications were also made to align our international revenues and long-term assets with the Company’s classification of domestic and international venues.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n _Significant Accounting Policies_\n\nRefer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Company’s significant accounting policies. The following represents changes in accounting policies during 2024, primarily attributable to the evaluation of accounting policies in conjunction with the Benihana acquisition discussed below:\n\n_Restricted cash and cash equivalents._ Restricted cash and cash equivalents are accounts that are restricted to funding payment of employee benefits and collateral accounts relating to liquor license bonds.\n\n_Goodwill._ Goodwill consists of goodwill associated with the Benihana Acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually on November 1st or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated a potential impairment.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure.” The ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The ASU includes amendments requiring enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its disclosures. \n\nNote 2 – Benihana Acquisition\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Safflower Holdings Corp. and its affiliates comprising of 93 company owned restaurants and 12 franchised restaurants (the “Benihana Acquisition”). The Company purchased the equity for a contractual price of $365.0 million, subject to customary adjustments. The Company believes that Benihana is complementary to its existing brands and will enable the Company to capture market share in the Vibe Dining segment.\n\n​\n\nThe assets and liabilities of Benihana were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The Company is in the process of finalizing the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired. Since the initial valuation, the Company adjusted the fair values for cash and cash equivalents by ($0.1) million, other current assets by $0.2 million, property and equipment by ($0.5) million, operating lease right-of-use assets by $1.2 million, deferred tax assets by $3.2 million, intangible assets by ($13.1) million, goodwill by $10.2 million, accrued expenses by $0.9 million, other current liabilities by ($2.2) million, and operating lease liabilities by $1.2 million to reflect the current fair value valuation and alignment with the Company’s accounting policies. The fair values set forth below are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to change as additional information is obtained during the measurement period which is up to one year from acquisition date (amounts in thousands). \n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Purchase consideration:**|  ​| ​  \nContractual purchase price| ​| $|  365,000  \nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and credit card receivable| ​| ​|  25,117  \nWorking capital adjustment| ​| ​|  1,151  \nCash consideration paid| ​| ​|  391,268  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Net assets acquired:**|  ​| ​| ​  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​| $|  20,879  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| ​| ​|  551  \nCredit card receivable| ​| ​|  3,687  \nInventory| ​| ​|  4,405  \nOther current assets| ​| ​|  7,471  \nProperty and equipment| ​|  102,552  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| ​|  182,346  \nDeferred tax assets, net| ​| ​|  29,991  \nIntangible assets| ​|  117,800  \nOther assets| ​|  2,899  \nAccounts payable| ​|  (9,851)  \nAccrued expenses| ​| ​|  (30,074)  \nOther current liabilities| ​|  (3,134)  \nOperating lease liabilities| ​|  (189,181)  \nOther long-term liabilities| ​| ​|  (4,404)  \nTotal net assets acquired| ​| ​|  235,937  \n**Goodwill**|  ​| $|  155,331  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nThe excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents benefits expected because of the acquisition, including sales and unit growth opportunities in addition to supply-chain and support-cost synergies. The Benihana and RA Sushi tradenames have an indefinite life based on the expected use of the asset and the regulatory and economic environment within which it is being used. The tradenames represent highly respected brands with positive connotations, and the Company intends to cultivate and protect the use of the brands. Goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\n\n​\n\nAs a result of the Benihana Acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million and $8.7 million of transaction costs, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are included in transaction and exit costs in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred $6.3 million and $10.1 million for transition and related integration efforts in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since the acquisition date, the Benihana Acquisition resulted in actual revenues of $209.2 million and net loss of $8.1 million in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n​\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 give effect to the Benihana Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023 (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the three months ended September 30,**|  ​| **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nTotal Revenues| ​| $|  193,975| ​| $|  201,688| ​| $|  625,001| ​| $|  636,337  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet (loss) income as reported| ​| $|  (8,890)| ​| $|  (5,522)| ​| $|  30,990| ​| $|  3,055  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTransaction and exit costs| ​| ​|  850| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  14,489| ​| ​|  (14,489)  \nTransition and integration costs| ​| ​|  6,274| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  10,068| ​| ​|  (10,068)  \nLoss on early debt extinguishment| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  4,149| ​| ​|  (4,149)  \nPurchase price accounting adjustments(1)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  177| ​| ​|  9,744| ​| ​|  640  \nChange in interest expense| ​| ​|  284| ​| ​|  1,139| ​| ​|  1,175| ​| ​|  2,309  \nPro forma net income (loss) before income taxes| ​| ​|  (1,482)| ​| ​|  (4,206)| ​| ​|  70,615| ​| ​|  (22,702)  \nIncome tax effect of adjustments| ​| ​|  (556)| ​| ​|  436| ​| ​|  (2,972)| ​| ​|  1,932  \nChange in valuation allowance| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (59,925)| ​| ​|  —  \nPro forma net income (loss)| ​| $|  (2,038)| ​| $|  (3,770)| ​| $|  7,718| ​| $|  (20,770)  \n  \n(1) Purchase price accounting adjustments include the elimination of Benihana's impairment charges and changes to depreciation \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe most significant adjustments included in the pro forma financial information are the elimination of the release of Benihana’s valuation allowance, elimination of Benihana’s impairment charges, movement of transaction, transition, integration and debt extinguishment costs, and increased interest expense associated with debt incurred to fund the Benihana Acquisition, all giving effect as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023.\n\n​\n\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes all significant necessary adjustments that can be factually supported to reflect the effects of the Benihana Acquisition and related transactions.

The Credit Agreement provides a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”, and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”), up to $10.0 million of which will be available in the form of letters of credit. On May 1, 2024, the Company borrowed $350.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility was and remains undrawn.\n\nThe Term Loan Facility is not subject to a financial covenant and the Revolving Facility’s financial covenant will apply only after 35% of the Revolving Facility’s capacity has been drawn.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Term Loan Facility bears interest at a margin over a reference rate selected at the option of the borrower. The margin for the Term Loan Facility is 6.5% per annum for SOFR borrowings and 5.5% per annum for base rate borrowings. The Term Loan Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the date of the related loan agreement. The Term Loan Facility is payable in quarterly installments commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, and are 1% per annum for the first year (through June 30, 2025), then 2.5% per annum for the next two years (through June 2027), then 5% per annum thereafter through maturity on April 30, 2029.\n\nThe Revolving Facility bears interest at a margin over a reference rate selected at the option of the borrower. The margin for the Revolving Facility is set quarterly based on the Company’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters and ranges from 5.5% to 6.0% per annum for SOFR borrowings and 4.5% to 5.0% for base rate borrowings. The Revolving Facility matures on November 1, 2028.\n\nThe Company’s weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit and Guarantee Agreement as of September 30, 2024 was 11.83%.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.6 million of debt issuance costs and $14.3 million of debt original issuance discount related to the Credit Agreement, which were capitalized and are recorded as a direct deduction to long-term debt and less than $0.1 million in debt issuance costs and $1.7 million of debt original issuance discount recorded in Other Assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. \n\n​\n\n _Debt Extinguishment_\n\n​\n\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into the credit agreement with Goldman Sachs, which was replaced with the Credit Agreement described above on May 1, 2024. The Goldman Sachs credit agreement provided for a secured revolving credit facility of $12.0 million, a $25.0 million term loan and a $50.0 million delayed draw term loan. On May 1, 2024, the outstanding loan balance was repaid and the unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.7 million and fees incurred of $2.4 million were recognized as a loss on early debt extinguishment on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n​\n\nNote 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Long-lived assets are measured and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis if an impairment is identified. There were no long-lived assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s long-term debt, including the current portion, is carried at cost on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, is valued using Level 2 inputs including current applicable rates for similar instruments and approximates the carrying value of such obligations. \n\nThe Company’s purchase price allocations for the Benihana Acquisition were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using Level 3 inputs.\n\nNote 8 – Income Taxes\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has computed its interim tax provision using the estimated annual effective tax rate method. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had elected to compute its interim tax provision using the actual year-to-date effective tax rate method as small changes in projected income could have produced large variations in the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 30.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. tax rate of 21% primarily due to the following: (i) tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees’ tips (ii) taxes owed in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate; (iii) taxes owed in state and local jurisdictions; (iv) transaction costs associated with the Benihana Acquisition; and (v) the tax effect of non-deductible compensation. The income tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the discrete period tax benefits resulting from the vesting of restricted stock units.\n\n​\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and various foreign income taxes for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by the federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. There are no ongoing federal, state, local, or foreign tax examinations as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNote 9 – Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following table provides information about contract liabilities, which include deferred license revenue, deferred gift card revenue, advanced party deposits and the Konavore rewards program (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nDeferred license revenue (1)| ​| $|  185| ​| $|  218  \nDeferred gift card and gift certificate revenue (2)| ​| $|  3,340| ​| $|  1,716  \nAdvanced party deposits (2)| ​| $|  692| ​| $|  361  \nKonavore rewards program (3)| ​| $|  195| ​| $|  177  \n(1)| Includes the current and long-term portion of deferred license revenue which are included in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Deferred gift card revenue and advance party deposits on goods and services yet to be provided are included in deferred gift card revenue and other on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  \n---|---  \n(3)| Konavore rewards program is included in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nRevenue recognized during the period from contract liabilities as of the preceding fiscal year end date is as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nRevenue recognized from deferred license revenue| ​| $|  33| ​| $|  60  \nRevenue recognized from deferred gift card revenue| ​| $|  1,106| ​| $|  1,121  \nRevenue recognized from advanced party deposits| ​| $|  361| ​| $|  278  \n  \n​\n\nThe estimated deferred license revenue to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of September 30, 2024 were as follows for each year ending (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024, three months remaining| $|  11  \n2025| ​|  44  \n2026| ​|  37  \n2027| ​|  34  \n2028| ​|  34  \nThereafter| ​|  25  \nTotal future estimated deferred license revenue| ​| $|  185  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nNote 10 – Leases\n\nThe components of lease expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**  \nLease cost| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating lease cost| $|  24,595| $|  12,104| ​  \nFinance lease cost| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAmortization of ROU assets| ​| ​|  157| ​| ​|  155| ​  \nInterest on lease liabilities| ​| ​|  66| ​| ​|  62| ​  \nTotal finance lease cost| ​| ​|  223| ​| ​|  217| ​  \nVariable lease cost (1)| ​| ​|  16,860| ​| ​|  8,499| ​  \nShort-term lease cost| ​| ​|  1,447| ​| ​|  805| ​  \nTotal lease cost| $|  43,125| $|  21,625| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted average remaining lease term| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating leases| ​| ​| 13 years| ​| ​| 13 years| ​  \nFinance leases| ​| ​| 4 years| ​| ​| 4 years| ​  \nWeighted average discount rate| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating leases| ​| ​|  10.31| %| ​|  8.63| %  \nFinance leases| ​| ​|  11.14| %| ​|  9.07| %  \n(1)| Variable lease cost is comprised of percentage rent and common area maintenance.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period was as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nFinance lease right-of-use assets (1)| ​| $|  841| ​| $|  850  \nCurrent portion of finance lease liabilities (1)| ​|  172| ​|  222  \nLong-term portion of finance lease liabilities (1)| ​| ​|  730| ​| ​|  658  \n(1)| Finance lease assets and liabilities are included in other assets, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases| ​| $|  21,479| ​| $|  10,760  \nOperating cash flows from finance leases| ​| $|  157| ​| $|  155  \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases| ​| $|  199| ​| $|  208  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating leases| ​| $|  3,081| ​| $|  9,039  \nFinance leases| $|  —| ​| $|  81  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nThe Company has entered into six operating leases for future restaurants that have not commenced as of September 30, 2024.

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of potential shares of common stock including common stock issuable pursuant to stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units. The two-class method for computing earnings per share will be utilized when applicable.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net (loss) income per share was calculated as follows (in thousands, except net income per share and related share data):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended September 30,**|  ​| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.| ​| $|  (8,890)| ​| $|  (3,098)| ​| $|  (17,888)| ​| $|  76  \nSeries A Preferred Stock paid-in-kind dividend and accretion| ​| ​|  (7,125)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (11,663)| ​| ​|  —  \nNet (loss) income available to common stockholders| ​| ​|  (16,015)| ​| ​|  (3,098)| ​| ​|  (29,551)| ​| ​|  76  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic weighted average shares outstanding| ​|  31,008,275| ​|  31,515,011| ​|  31,256,946| ​|  31,657,761  \nDilutive effect of stock options, warrants and restricted share units| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  879,811  \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding| ​|  31,008,275| ​|  31,515,011| ​|  31,256,946| ​|  32,537,572  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic net (loss) income per common share| ​| $|  (0.52)| ​| $|  (0.10)| ​| $|  (0.95)| ​| $|  —  \nDiluted net (loss) income per common share| ​| $|  (0.52)| ​| $|  (0.10)| ​| $|  (0.95)| ​| $|  —  \n  \n​\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 3.1 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of stock options, warrants and restricted share units were determined to be anti-dilutive and were therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 2.3 million and a nominal amount of stock options, warrants and restricted share units were anti-dilutive.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nNote 12 – Series A Preferred Stock\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company issued 160,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $160.0 million, subject to a 5% original issuance discount. Additionally, the Company recorded an additional discount of $2.3 million for expenses paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock. \n\n​\n\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting and non-convertible; has compounding dividends that begin at a rate of 13.0% per annum and increase over time at specified intervals; is subject to optional redemption by the Company and mandatory redemption following specified events and in certain circumstances upon the exercise by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of an option to deliver written notice to the Company to require redemption, in each case, for specified prices; and gives certain consent rights for the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for specified matters. \n\n​\n\nThe Company records the paid-in-kind dividend and accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock using the effective interest method based on a future redemption value of $247.4 million payable in 2027, the earliest date at which the Company can redeem the Series A Preferred Stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded paid-in-kind dividends and accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock of $7.2 million and $11.7 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n _Redemption Rights_\n\n​\n\nOn and after May 1, 2029, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to require redemption of all or any part of the Series A Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the liquidation preference after the fifth anniversary, upon an acceleration of material indebtedness or upon a change-of-control. However, at any time between the third and fourth anniversary of the issuance date, the Company may repurchase all or some of the preferred stock for 102.5% of the liquidation preference. At any time after the fourth anniversary, the Company may repurchase all of some of the preferred stock for 100% of the liquidation preference.\n\n​\n\nSince the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable and therefore not certain to occur, the Series A Preferred Stock is not required to be classified as a liability under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. As the Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable in certain circumstances at the option of the holder and is redeemable in certain circumstances upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the Company’s control, the Series A Preferred Stock is classified separately from stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n​\n\nNote 13 – Stockholder’s Equity\n\n**Preferred Stock**\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 9,840,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001. There were no shares of preferred stock that were issued or outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, other than the Series A Preferred Stock discussed above.\n\n​\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nThe issuance of a dividend is dependent on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, available cash and the overall financial condition of the Company. The issuance of a dividend is also subject to legal restrictions and the terms of the Company’s credit agreement. The Company did not issue dividends related to its common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n​\n\n _Stock Purchase Program_\n\n​\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $15.0 million of outstanding common stock that was completed in December 2023. In March 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $5.0 million of repurchases under this program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company spent $2.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the repurchases of 0.6 million and 0.7 million shares, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.5 million and 1.1 million shares, respectively, for an aggregate consideration of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 3,007,020 shares for $18.2 million under the repurchase program.\n\n​\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nNote 14 – Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants\n\n**Stock-Based Compensation**\n\n​\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,862,779 shares available for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan.\n\nStock-based compensation cost was $1.6 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4.4 million and $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Turn-key F&B services are food and beverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by us for the client at a particular hospitality venue. Our vision is to be a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance, high-energy and cuisine into one great experience that we refer to as “Vibe Dining”. We design all our restaurants, lounges and F&B services to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors.\n\nOur primary restaurant brands are as follows:\n\n●| STK, a modern twist on the American steakhouse concept featuring premium steaks, seafood and specialty cocktails in an energetic upscale atmosphere;  \n---|---  \n●| Benihana, an interactive dining destination with highly skilled chefs preparing food in front of guests and served in an energetic atmosphere alongside fresh sushi and innovative cocktails;  \n---|---  \n●| Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere; and  \n---|---  \n●| RA Sushi, a Japanese cuisine concept that offers a fun-filled, bar-forward, upbeat, and vibrant dining atmosphere anchored by creative sushi, inventive drinks, and outstanding service.   \n---|---  \n  \nOur F&B hospitality management services are marketed as ONE Hospitality and include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. We also provide hospitality advisory and consulting services to certain clients. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands such as the W Hotel, ME Hotel and Hippodrome Casino. For those restaurants and venues that are managed, licensed or franchised, we generate management fee revenue and franchise revenue based on top-line revenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the location’s revenues and net profits.\n\nWe opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York, New York. We currently own, operate, manage, license or franchise 166 venues including 29 STKs, 85 Benihanas, 27 Kona Grills and 16 RA Sushiin major cities in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and 9 F&B venues operated under ONE Hospitality in four hotels and casinos throughout the United States and Europe. \n\nAs our footprint increases, we expect to benefit by leveraging system-wide operating efficiencies and best practices through the management of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of overall revenue.\n\nWe intend to open six new venues in 2024. As of the date of this report we have opened the following:\n\n●| Owned STK restaurant in Washington DC  \n---|---  \n●| Owned RA Sushi restaurant in Plantation, Florida  \n---|---  \n●| Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Tigard, Oregon  \n---|---  \n●| Owned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida  \n---|---  \n  \n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| Owned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado  \n---|---  \n  \nThere are currently two Company-owned STK restaurants and one Company-owned Benihana restaurant under construction in the following cities:\n\n●| Owned STK restaurant in Topanga, California  \n---|---  \n●| Owned STK restaurant in Los Angeles, California  \n---|---  \n●| Owned Benihana restaurant in San Mateo, California  \n---|---  \n  \nIn July 2024, we terminated a franchise agreement for one restaurant.\n\nIn October 2024, we closed four company-owned RA Sushi restaurants.\n\nThe table below reflects our current venues by restaurant brand and geographic location:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Venues**  \n​| **STK**(1)| **Benihana**(3)| **Kona Grill**| **RA Sushi**| **ONE Hospitality**(2)| **Total**  \n**Domestic**|  ​| ​  \nOwned|  18| ​|  74| ​|  27| ​|  16| ​|  3|  138  \nManaged|  2| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  1|  3  \nLicensed|  1| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —|  1  \nFranchised|  —| ​|  8| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —|  8  \nTotal domestic|  21| ​|  82| ​|  27| ​|  16| ​|  4|  150  \n**International**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOwned|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  1|  1  \nManaged|  4| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  4|  8  \nLicensed|  4| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —|  4  \nFranchised|  —| ​|  3| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —|  3  \nTotal international|  8| ​|  3| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  5|  16  \n**Total venues**|  29| ​|  85| ​|  27| ​|  16| ​|  9|  166  \n(1)| Locations with an STK and STK Rooftop are considered one venue location.

The Credit Agreement provides a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, up to $10.0 million of which will be available in the form of letters of credit. On May 1, 2024, we borrowed $350.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility was and remains undrawn.\n\n​\n\nRefer to Notes 6 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the new credit facility and preferred stock financing.\n\n​\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\nRefer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Company’s key performance indicators. The following represents changes in key performance indicators during 2024, primarily attributable to the evaluation of accounting policies in conjunction with the Benihana acquisition discussed below:\n\n_Same Store Sales (“SSS”)._ SSS represents total food and beverage sales at domestic owned and managed restaurants opened for at least a full 24-month period at the beginning of each quarter, which removes the impact of new restaurant openings and closures in comparing the operations of existing restaurants. For STK SSS, this measure includes total revenue from our owned and managed domestic STK locations, excluding revenues from our owned STK restaurant located in the W Hotel in Los Angeles, California due to the impact of the F&B hospitality management agreement with the hotel. Revenues from locations where we do not directly control the event sales force are excluded from this measure.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\n​\n\nTotal revenues increased $117.1 million, or 152.3% to $194.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $76.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Benihana Acquisition on May 1, 2024.

The change is primarily attributed to transaction, transition and integration costs related to the Benihana Acquisition partially offset by the increase in operating income attributable to the acquired restaurants. \n\nRestaurant operating profit increased $16.0 million, or 175.6% to $25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

on Form 10-Q to supplement other measures of financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We have evolved our definition of Adjusted EBITDA starting in the third quarter of 2024 to provide more clarity and comparability relative to peers. We will exclude pre-opening expenses as an add back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Prior period amounts presented in the table below have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. \n\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash rent expense, transaction and exit costs, transition and integration expenses, stock-based compensation, and non-recurring gains and losses. Not all of the items defining Adjusted EBITDA occur in each reporting period but have been included in our definitions of these terms based on our historical activity _._ We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net revenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses. \n\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are appropriate measures of our operating performance because they eliminate non-cash or non-recurring expenses that do not reflect our underlying business performance. We believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business and to evaluate the performance of our restaurants. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit, alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, to measure profitability, as a key profitability target in our budgets, and to compare our performance against that of peer companies despite possible differences in calculation.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to

30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n​\n\n _Revenues_\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant net revenue_ _._ Owned restaurant net revenue increased $116.9 million, or 158.6%, to $190.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $73.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants on May 1, 2024, which generated $119.4 million in revenues and $10.1 million in revenues from six new restaurants opened since October 2023, partially offset by a reduction in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 8.8% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_Management, license and incentive fee revenue_ _._ Management, license and incentive fee revenues increased $0.2 million, or 6.4%, to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management, license and incentive fee revenue attributed to Benihana franchised restaurants contributed $0.7 million in revenues during the third quarter of 2024 which was offset by decreased revenues at our managed STK restaurants in North America and early termination of the STK Westminster management agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we consolidated our operations in London, UK.\n\n​\n\n _Cost and Expenses_\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant cost of sales_ _._ Food and beverage costs for owned restaurants increased $21.7 million, or 118.8%, to $39.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in owned restaurant cost of sales is primarily attributed to $23.2 million in cost of sales associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024. As a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue, cost of sales decreased 380 basis points from 24.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales for Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants as compared to STK and Kona Grill restaurants, product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant operating expenses_ _._ Owned restaurant operating expenses increased $79.2 million to $125.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $46.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in owned restaurant operating expense is primarily attributed to $77.7 million in operating expenses associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024. Owned restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue increased 300 basis points from 62.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 65.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n _General and administrative_ _._ General and administrative costs increased $5.5 million, or 75.6%, to $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to incremental headcount associated with the Benihana Acquisition and increased stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs were 6.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\n _Depreciation and amortization_ _._ Depreciation and amortization expense was $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to depreciation and amortization for the Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024, depreciation associated with the opening of six new owned venues since October 2023 and capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the guest experience in our restaurants.\n\n​\n\n _Pre-opening expenses_. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $2.1 million of pre-opening expenses primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Tigard, which opened on September 17, 2024, and STK Aventura, which opened in October 2024. We also incurred costs during the third quarter of 2024 for STK, Benihana and Kona Grill restaurants currently under development. Total pre-opening expenses related to non-cash pre-open rent was $0.3 million.\n\nPre-opening expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $3.1 million, primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Riverton, which opened in July 2023, and STK and Kona Grill restaurants that were under development. Detail of pre-opening expenses by category is provided in the table below for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).\n\n​\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Preopen Expenses**| **Preopen Rent**(2)| ​| **Total**  \nTraining Team| ​| $|  1,116| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,116  \nRestaurants (1)| ​| ​|  549| ​| ​|  445| ​| ​|  994  \nTotal| ​| $|  1,665| ​| $|  445| ​| $|  2,110  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**| **Preopen Expenses**| **Preopen Rent**(2)| ​| **Total**  \nTraining Team| ​| $|  1,562| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,562  \nRestaurants| ​| ​|  1,071| ​| ​|  464| ​| ​|  1,535  \nTotal| ​| $|  2,633| ​| $|  464| ​| $|  3,097  \n(1)| Includes Salt Water Social, STK Aventura, Kona Grill Tigard, RA Sushi Plantation and other venues under development.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Cash rent paid was $202 and $64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n _Transaction and exit costs_ _._ Transaction and exit costs were $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These costs primarily included investment banking, legal and professional fees incurred in conjunction with the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024. \n\n​\n\n _Transition and integration costs_ _._ In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $6.3 million of transition and integration costs associated with the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024. Included in these costs are expenses related to the implementation of happy hour and wagyu offerings at Benihana and identified duplicate professional service vendors, operational support offices, support positions, and maintenance expenses that will be eliminated in the foreseeable future. Over the next twelve months, we intend to integrate Benihana by leveraging our corporate infrastructure, our supply chain, and unique Vibe Dining program, to elevate the brand experience and drive improved performance. \n\n​\n\n _Interest expense, net_ _._ Interest expense, net was $10.7 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We borrowed $350.0 million on the Credit Agreement on May 1, 2024 to finance the Benihana Acquisition. The weighted average interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was ­11.8% compared to 12.1% in the same period of 2023.\n\n​\n\n _Benefit for income taxes_ _._ For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax benefit was $4.6 million compared to income tax benefit of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n_Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest_. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\n**Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n​\n\n _Revenues_\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant net revenue_ _._ Owned restaurant net revenue increased $208.9 million, or 90.0%, to $441.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $232.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants on May 1, 2024, which generated $208.1 million in revenues for the five-month period owned by the Company, and $32.6 million in revenues from six new restaurants opened since October 2023, partially offset by a reduction in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.9% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\n_Management, license and incentive fee revenue_ _._ Management, license and incentive fee revenues decreased $0.3 million, or 2.7%, to $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $10.6 million for the nine months September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased revenues at our STK restaurants in North America and early termination of the STK Westminster management agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we consolidated our operations in London, UK, partially offset by $1.1 million in revenues attributed to Benihana franchised restaurants.\n\n​\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Cost and Expenses_\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant cost of sales_ _._ Food and beverage costs for owned restaurants increased $38.2 million, or 67.8%, to $94.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was due to the incremental sales increases noted above from the acquisition of Benihana and RA Sushi and the opening of six new venues since September 2023, partially offset by product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\n\n​\n\nAs a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue, cost of sales improved 280 basis points from 24.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales for Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants as compared to STK and Kona Grill restaurants, product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives.\n\n​\n\n _Owned restaurant operating expenses_ _._ Owned restaurant operating expenses increased $136.5 million to $278.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $142.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 The increase in owned restaurant operating expense is primarily attributed to $131.5 million in operating expenses associated with revenues generated by Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024. Owned restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue increased 200 basis points from 61.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 63.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n _General and administrative_ _._ General and administrative costs increased $8.1 million, or 35.7%, to $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to incremental headcount associated with the Benihana Acquisition and increased stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs were 6.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\n _Depreciation and amortization_ _._ Depreciation and amortization expense was $22.7 million and $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily related to five months of depreciation and amortization for the Benihana and RA Sushi restaurants acquired on May 1, 2024, depreciation associated with the six new owned venues opened since October 2023 and capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the guest experience in our restaurants.\n\n​\n\n _Pre-opening expenses_. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $7.5 million of pre-opening expenses primarily related to payroll, training and non-cash pre-open rent for STK Washington DC, which opened in March 2024, RA Sushi Plantation which opened on July 1, 2024, Kona Grill Tigard which opened in September 2024, and STK Aventura which opened in October 2024. Total pre-opening expenses related to non-cash pre-open rent was $0.9 million. \n\nPre-opening expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $6.0 million primarily related to payroll, training, and non-cash pre-open rent for Kona Grill Columbus and Kona Grill Riverton, which opened in January 2023 and July 2023, respectively, and STK Charlotte and Kona Grill Phoenix, which opened in October 2023, and STK and Kona Grill restaurants under development.

These costs primarily included investment banking, legal and professional fees incurred in conjunction with the Benihana Acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n _Transition and integration costs_ _._ In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $10.1 million of transition and integration costs associated with the Benihana and RA Sushi acquisition, which closed on May 1, 2024. Included in these costs are expenses related to the implementation of happy hour and wagyu offerings at Benihana and identified duplicate professional service vendors, operational support offices, support positions, and maintenance expenses that will be eliminated in the foreseeable future. Over the next twelve months, we intend to integrate Benihana by leveraging our corporate infrastructure, our supply chain, and unique Vibe Dining program, to elevate the brand experience and drive improved performance. \n\n​\n\n _Interest expense, net_ _._ Interest expense, net was $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We borrowed $350.0 million on the Credit Agreement on May 1, 2024 to finance the Benihana Acquisition. The weighted average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was ­11.8% compared to 11.8% in the same period of 2023.\n\n​\n\n _Loss on early debt extinguishment_ _._ On May 1, 2024, in conjunction with entering into the Credit Agreement, we prepaid the outstanding debt balance under the credit agreement with Goldman Sachs to early extinguish the $73.1 million of outstanding term loans. We recognized a $4.1 million loss on debt extinguishment primarily caused by the prepayment penalty and the recognition of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the debt extinguished.\n\n​\n\n _Benefit for income taxes_ _._ The benefit for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.2 million compared to a benefit for income taxes of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n_Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest_. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n​\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our lease obligations, working capital and capital expenditure needs and to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt. Subject to our operating performance, which, if significantly adversely affected, would adversely affect the availability of funds, we expect to finance our operations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future, including the costs of opening currently planned new restaurants, through cash provided by operations and construction allowances provided by landlords of certain locations. We also may borrow on our revolving credit facility or issue equity, including preferred stock, to support ongoing business operations. We believe these sources of financing are adequate to support our immediate business operations and plans. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $28.7 million and $349.1 million in long-term debt, which consisted of borrowings under our Credit Agreement.As of September 30, 2024, the availability on our revolving credit facility was $34.1 million, subject to certain conditions.\n\n​\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures were $53.8 million of which $43.0 million related to the construction of new STK, Benihana, Kona Grill and RA Sushi restaurants and $10.7 million related to existing restaurants. Net capital expenditures, inclusive of $4.7 million in landlord contributions, was $49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to receive between $3.0 million to $4.0 million in landlord contributions in the next three months. Capital expenditures by type for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively are provided below (in thousands).\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**|  ​| **STK**|  ​| **Benihana**|  ​| **Kona Grill**|  ​| **RA Sushi**|  ​| **Other**(1)| ​| **Total**  \nNew Venues| ​| $|  32,833| ​| $|  1,401| ​| $|  7,113| ​| $|  1,257| ​| $|  414| ​| $|  43,018  \nMaintenance| ​| ​|  2,865| ​| ​|  4,739| ​| ​|  2,395| ​| ​|  668| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  10,667  \nOther| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  85| ​| ​|  85  \nTotal | ​| $|  35,698| ​| $|  6,140| ​| $|  9,508| ​| $|  1,925| ​| $|  499| ​| $|  53,770  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTenant Improvement Allowance| ​| $|  3,247| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,460| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  4,706  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**|  ​| **STK**|  ​| **Benihana**|  ​| **Kona Grill**|  ​| **RA Sushi**|  ​| **Other**(1)| ​| **Total**  \nNew Venues| ​| $|  15,798| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  13,457| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,743| ​| $|  30,998  \nMaintenance| ​| ​|  3,675| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  3,379| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  7,054  \nOther| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  359| ​| ​|  359  \nTotal | ​| $|  19,473| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  16,836| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  2,102| ​| $|  38,411  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTenant Improvement Allowance| ​| $|  1,033| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  750| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,783  \n  \n(1)Includes inventory of restaurant equipment for venues under development. \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur operations have not required significant working capital, and, like many restaurant companies, we may have negative working capital during the year. Revenues are received primarily in credit card or cash receipts, and restaurant operations do not require significant receivables or inventories, other than our wine inventory. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter.\n\n​\n\nOur future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of expansion, conditions in the retail property development market, construction costs, the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants, and the nature of the specific leases and associated tenant improvement allowances available, if any, as negotiated with landlords. We have made significant investments in our training and development teams to support new restaurants openings. We believe these investments are necessary to support the successful opening of our new restaurants. If we modify our growth plans, the personnel that comprise our training team could be deployed to operate existing restaurants.\n\n​\n\nTo help manage future cash requirements, we limit the number of owned company venues under construction at any given time to six restaurants. We also set a maximum number of signed leases for new restaurant development to twelve in order to minimize our cash rent commitment to approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million annually for restaurants under development.\n\n​\n\n _Capital Expenditures and Lease Arrangements_\n\nWhen we open new Company-owned restaurants, our capital expenditures for construction increase. For owned STK restaurants, where we build from a shell state, we have typically targeted a restaurant size of 8,000 square feet with a gross cash investment of approximately $515 to $675 per square foot, exclusive of $200 per square foot in landlord contributions. For owned Kona Grill restaurants, where we build from a shell state, we have typically targeted a restaurant size of 7,000 square feet with a gross cash investment of approximately $510 per square foot, exclusive of $150 per square foot in landlord contributions. In situations where we add functional space and build an STK or Kona Grill restaurant with a mezzanine, covered patio, or rooftop, costs per square foot will increase. Typical cash pre-opening costs are $0.6 million to $0.8 million, excluding the impact of cash and non-cash pre-opening rent. In addition, some of our existing restaurants will require capital improvements to either maintain or improve the facilities. We may add seating or provide enclosures for outdoor space in the next twelve months for some of our locations, when we believe that will increase revenues for those locations.\n\nOur hospitality F&B venues typically require limited capital investment from us. Capital expenditures for these projects will primarily be funded by cash flows from operations depending upon the timing of these expenditures and cash availability.\n\nWe typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for periods of 10 to 20 years under operating lease arrangements, with a limited number of renewal options. Our rent structure varies, but our leases generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent rent based on sales, as well as other expenses related to the leases such as our pro-rata share of common area maintenance, property tax and insurance expenses. Many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants. Generally, landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased minimum rents. However, there can be no assurance that such allowances will be available to us on each project that we select for development.\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nRefer to Note 6 and Note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the terms of our long-term debt arrangements and information regarding our commitments and contingencies.\n\n​\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Cash Flows_\n\n​\n\nThe following table summarizes the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet cash provided by (used in):| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  25,668| ​| $|  15,228  \nInvesting activities| ​|  (423,606)| ​|  (38,411)  \nFinancing activities| ​|  405,565| ​|  (9,681)  \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash| ​|  10| ​|  (120)  \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents| ​| $|  7,637| ​| $|  (32,984)  \n  \n​\n\n _Operating Activities_ _._ Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of collections on accounts receivables and payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n\n​\n\n _Investing Activities_. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $423.6 million, which was comprised of $369.8 million for the Benihana acquisition, net of cash acquired, and $53.8 million in capital expenditures for the construction of STK Washington DC, which opened in March 2024, RA Sushi Plantation, which opened in July 2024, Kona Grill Tigard, which opened in September 2024, and STK Aventura, which opened in October 2024, in addition to residual payments on four restaurants that opened during the fourth quarter of 2023 and several restaurants that were under development as of September 30, 2024. \n\n​\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $38.4 million primarily for the construction of STK restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Salt Lake City, Utah and Washington D.C. and Kona Grill restaurants in Columbus, Ohio; Riverton, Utah and Phoenix, Arizona and several restaurants that were under development as of September 30, 2023, as well as capital expenditures for existing restaurants.\n\n​\n\n _Financing Activities_. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $405.6 million and was comprised of net proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $333.8 million and net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants of $138.9 million, partially offset by the repayment of the Goldman Sachs debt of $73.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which reflected $7.7 million in common stock purchased under our share repurchase program and $1.8 million in tax withholding obligation on stock-based compensation.\n\n​\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\n​\n\nSee Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the recent accounting pronouncements discussed in Note 1 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n​\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.**\n\n​\n\nAs a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information.\n\n​\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n​\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n​\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ndesired control objectives, as our controls are designed to do, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the risk and cost benefit relationship related to controls and procedures.\n\n​\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. \n\n​\n\nChanges in Internal Controls\n\n​\n\nOn May 1, 2024, we completed the Benihana Acquisition and have implemented new processes and internal controls to assist us in the preparation and disclosure of financial information. Given the significance of the Benihana Acquisition, we intend to exclude the acquired Benihana business from our assessment and report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. Other than discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. \n\n​\n\n**PART II —****OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n​\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nWe are subject to claims common to our industry and in the ordinary course of our business. Companies in our industry, including us, have been and are subject to class action lawsuits, primarily regarding compliance with labor laws and regulations. Defending lawsuits requires significant management attention and financial resources and the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. We believe that accrual and disclosure for these matters are adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements. We do not believe the ultimate resolutions of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. However, the resolution of lawsuits is difficult to predict. A significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than is currently anticipated, could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors.**\n\n​\n\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\n​\n\nIn September 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $10.0 million of outstanding common stock.

The term “year ended” refers to the entire calendar year unless the\ncontext otherwise indicates.\nItem 1. Business\nDescription of the Business\nWe are an international restaurant company that develops, owns and operates, manages and licenses upscale and polished casual, high-\nenergy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services and consulting service for hospitality venues\nincluding hotels, casinos and other high-end locations. Turn-key F&B services are food and beverage services that can be scaled,\ncustomized and implemented by us for the client at a particular hospitality venue. Our vision is to be a global market leader in the\nhospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance, high-energy and cuisine into one great experience that we refer to as “Vibe\nDining”. We design all our restaurants, lounges and F&B services to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within\na destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice\ncompetitors.\nOur primary restaurant brands are STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social atmosphere with the\nquality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse, and Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American\nfavorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere. Our F&B hospitality management services are\nmarketed as ONE Hospitality and include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and\ncatering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. We also\nprovide hospitality advisory and consulting services to certain clients. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands such as\nthe W Hotel, ME Hotel, Hippodrome Casino, and Curio Collection by Hilton. For those restaurants and venues that are managed or\nlicensed, we generate management fee revenue based on top-line revenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the\nlocation’s revenues and net profits.\n2\nTable of Contents\nWe opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York, New York. We currently own, operate, manage or license 63 venues\nincluding 28 STKs and 27 Kona Grills in major metropolitan cities in North America, Europe and the Middle East and 8 F&B venues in\nfour hotels and casinos in the United States and Europe.\nWe opened the following eight new venues in 2023:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina\n● Owned STK restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts\n● Owned STK restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Columbus, Ohio\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Riverton, Utah\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona\n● Two Bao Yum venues through a licensing agreement with Reef Kitchens\nRecently the Company exited its licensing agreement with REEF Kitchens and has no venues operating pursuant to that agreement.\nWe intend to add six to eight new venues in 2024. In March 2024, we opened the following:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Washington DC\nThere is currently one Company-owned STK restaurant, one Company-owned Kona Grill restaurant, and one Company-owned Salt\nWater Social restaurant under construction in the following cities:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant Tigard, Oregon\n● Owned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado\nAs our footprint increases, we expect to benefit by leveraging system-wide operating efficiencies and best practices through the\nmanagement of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of overall revenue.\nBrands and Locations\nThe table below reflects our venues by restaurant brand and geographic location:\nVenues\nSTK(1) Kona Grill ONE Hospitality(2) Total\nDomestic\nOwned 17 27 2 46\nManaged 2 — 1 3\nLicensed 1 — — 1\nTotal domestic 20 27 3 50\nInternational\nOwned — — 1 1\nManaged 4 — 4 8\nLicensed 4 — — 4\nTotal international 8 — 5 13\nTotal venues\n28 27 8 63\n(1) Locations with an STK and STK Rooftop are considered one venue location. This includes the STK Rooftop in San Diego, CA, which is a licensed location.\n(2) Includes concepts under the Company’s F&B hospitality management agreements and other venue brands such as Bao Yum, Heliot, Hideout, Radio and Rivershore Bar\n& Grill.\nWe expect to continue expanding our operations domestically and internationally primarily through a mix of owned, licensed and\nmanaged restaurants using a disciplined and targeted site selection process. We refer to our licensing and management strategy as our\n“capital light strategy” because it requires significantly less capital than expansion through\n3\nTable of Contents\nowned restaurants only. Refer to Item 2 – Properties for additional details regarding the domestic and international locations in which we\noperate.\nSTK\nSTK is a global steakhouse restaurant concept with locations in major metropolitan cities. STK artfully blends the modern steakhouse\nand a chic lounge, offering a high-energy, fine dining experience in a social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale\nsteakhouse. Each STK location features a large, open restaurant and bar area with a DJ playing music throughout the restaurant, offering\nour customers a high-energy, fun “destination” environment that encourages social interaction. We believe this Vibe Dining concept truly\ndifferentiates us from other upscale steakhouses. Our menu provides a variety of portion sizes and signature options to appeal to a broad\ncustomer demographic.\nWe operate seventeen owned, six managed and five licensed STK restaurants in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Our STK\nrestaurants average 10,000 square feet, and we typically target locations that range in size from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. In 2023, the\naverage domestic restaurant revenues and average domestic check per person for owned and managed STK restaurants that have been open\nat least 18 months at December 31, 2023 were $17.3 million and $130, respectively.\nWe are focused on expanding our global STK footprint. We believe that the locations of our STK restaurants are critical to our long-\nterm success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyze prospective restaurant sites. We intend to continue our focus on\n(i) metropolitan areas with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concept and (ii) finding partners with\nexcellent track records and brand recognition. We also consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and\noffice buildings, hotels and convention centers, area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. We have identified over 75\nadditional major metropolitan areas across the globe where we could grow our STK brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to open five to six STKs annually.\nKona Grill\nKona Grill is a bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, steaks, seafood, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a\npolished casual atmosphere. Kona Grill offers freshly prepared food and attentive service in an upscale, contemporary ambiance that\ncreates an exceptional dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants. Menu items are crafted to have\nmemorable flavor profiles that appeal to a wide range of customers. The diverse menu is complemented by a full-service bar offering a\nbroad assortment of wines, craft cocktails, and beers. We believe that the Kona Grill brand is complementary to our STK brand and enables\nus to capture market share in the Vibe Dining segment.\nWe own and operate 27 Kona Grill restaurants within 18 states in the United States. Our Kona Grill restaurants average approximately\n7,000 to 8,000 square feet. In 2023, the average restaurant revenues were $5.2 million and average spend per transaction was $63. We\nbelieve we can grow the Kona Grill brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future. We expect to open three to five Kona Grills\nannually.\nONE Hospitality\nOur ONE Hospitality platform is composed of our F&B hospitality management and consulting agreements with hotels, casinos, and\nother high-end locations as well as our other brands and venue concepts, which are described below:\n● F&B Services. Our F&B services for hospitality venues provide attractive and comprehensive tailored food and beverage\nsolutions to our hospitality clients. Our fee-based hospitality food and beverage solutions include developing, managing and\noperating restaurants, bars, rooftops, pools, banquet and catering services, private dining rooms, in-room dining services and mini\nbars on a contract basis. Currently, we operate three venues pursuant to F&B hospitality management agreements with hotels and\ncasinos in the United States and in Europe. Historically, our clients have provided the majority of the capital required for the\ndevelopment of the facilities we manage on their behalf.\n4\nTable of Contents\n● Bao Yum. A fast-casual concept that offers a whimsical twist on classic bao. Bao Yum serves breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert\nbao along with a variety of salads, soups, sandwiches and snacks. Bao Yum currently operates in London.\n● Heliot. Heliot Steak House is an award-winning steakhouse and bar within the Hippodrome Casino in London that offers\nimpressive views of the main casino gambling floor.\n● Hideout. The Hideout by STK is an outdoor, poolside restaurant and bar within the W Hotel in Westwood, California, which\ncomplements our owned STK and F&B hospitality services also offered within the W Hotel in Westwood.\n● Radio. Radio Rooftop is a premier rooftop restaurant and lounge bar concept boasting striking city views with a signature location\non top of the ME Milan hotel.\n● Rivershore Bar & Grill. Rivershore Bar & Grill celebrates the end of the Oregon Trail with a beautiful river view, American\nfavorites and friendly, professional service in Oregon City, Oregon.\n● Salt Water Social. Salt Water Social is a seafood concept which artfully blends the classic seafood restaurant and a chic lounge\ninto a high-energy, fine dining experience.\nOur F&B hospitality contracts generate revenues for us through management fees, which are typically calculated as a percentage of the\noperation’s revenues, and we earn additional milestone and incentive fees based on the operation’s profitability. We typically target F&B\nhospitality service opportunities where we believe we can generate at least $500,000 of annual pre-tax income.\nWe expect our F&B hospitality services business to be an important driver of our growth and profitability, enabling us to generate\nleads to develop managed STK restaurants and management fee income with minimal capital expenditures. We believe we are well\npositioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with global hospitality providers to drive the\ncontinued growth of our F&B hospitality business. We continue to receive inbound inquiries regarding new opportunities globally, and we\ncontinue to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. We expect to enter into\none to two new F&B hospitality agreements annually.\nWe exercised our option to renew the management agreement with ME London to manage STK. Effective January 1, 2023, ME\nLondon elected not to renew Radio, Marconi and in-room dining per the agreement. Therefore, we only continue to manage the STK\nrestaurant at ME London. In October 2023, we consolidated STK operations in London, United Kingdom to STK Strand and STK Stratford\nwhich resulted in the closure of our operations within the Westminster London Hotel. In December 2023, our agreement with ANGEL at\nthe Hotel Calimala in Florence, Italy terminated. In February 2024, we terminated our agreement with REEF Kitchens.\nSourcing and Supply Chain\nWe seek to ensure that consistently high-quality food and beverages are served at all of our venues through the coordination and\ncooperation of our purchasing and culinary teams.\nOur culinary and purchasing teams establish product specifications on a global basis, which are then disseminated to all locations\nthrough recipe books for all dishes served at our properties. We are committed to culinary innovation which allows us flexibility in our\npreparations and offerings in order to manage costs and ensure regular availability.\nWe maintain consistent pricing standards and procedures for all top-volume purchases at our restaurants.\nWe select high quality suppliers and negotiate pricing on a national level in each country where one or more of our restaurants operate.\nWe test new suppliers on a regional basis for an extended period before using them on a national basis. We periodically review supplier\nconsistency and satisfaction with our restaurant chefs and continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure the meat,\nseafood and other menu ingredients that we purchase comply with our high-quality specifications. We believe we have strong relationships\nwith national and regional foodservice\n5\nTable of Contents\ndistributors who can continue to supply us with our products on a consistent basis. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants from our\nsuppliers.\nOur corporate beverage program establishes guidelines for ordering beverage products at our properties. We provide beverage\nmanagers at each restaurant with national guidelines for standardized products. Our concepts emphasize the bar as a key driver of activity\nin our restaurants. In 2023, the sale of beverages accounted for approximately 23% of restaurant revenues.\nOn a company-wide basis, no supplier of food accounts for more than 30% of our total food and beverage purchases and no brand of\nalcohol accounts for more than 25% of our alcohol purchases. We believe that our food and beverage supplies are available from a\nsignificant number of alternate suppliers and that the loss of a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our costs of supplies.\nAdvertising and Marketing\nThe primary focus of our advertising and marketing is to increase awareness of our brands and our overall reputation for quality,\nservice and delivering a high-energy experience. Our marketing efforts are designed to strengthen our brand recognition in markets where\nwe operate and to create brand awareness in new markets before opening a new location. We use digital/social media channels, targeted\nlocal media such as magazines, billboards and other out-of-home advertising, and a strong network of public relations teams to increase the\nfrequency with which our existing customers visit our restaurants and to attract new customers. We conduct frequent promotional programs\ntailored to the city, brand and clientele of each location. We utilize a network of local and national public relations firms to support these\npromotional programs. Additional marketing functions include the use of our websites, www.STKsteakhouse.com and\nwww.KonaGrill.com, to facilitate online reservations, to-go/delivery orders and gift card sales to drive revenue.\nCompetition\nThe restaurant and hospitality industries are intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of\nfacilities and type and quality of food. We experience competition from a variety of sources, including upscale steakhouse chains such as\nRuth Chris, Del Frisco’s, Fleming’s, Mastro’s and The Capital Grille, local upscale steakhouses and polished casual chains, such as The\nCheesecake Factory, Bonefish and BJ’s. There is also competition from other Vibe Dining restaurants such as Nobu, Catch, Lavo, Zuma\nand Tao and other high-end hospitality services companies such as the Gerber Group and Lettuce Entertain You. To the extent that we\noperate lounges and similar venues in hotels and resorts, we are subject to our host venues being able to compete effectively in attracting\ncustomers to frequent our establishments.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. Because of the seasonality of the business and the\nindustry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or the full calendar\nyear. Typically, our fourth quarter has higher sales volumes than other quarters in the year.\nIntellectual Property\nOur rights in our registered and unregistered intellectual property, including trademarks and service marks, are significant to our\nbusiness. We own the U.S. federal registration rights to “STK,” “Kona Grill,” and several related word marks and design marks related to\nour brands. We depend on registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to maintain the identity of our locations. We license\nthe rights to use certain trademarks we own or license to our licensees in connection with their operations. We also own several other\ntrademarks and service marks. It is our policy to defend our marks against encroachment by others.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 60 employees within our support center, 27 employees in multi-unit leadership and an\naggregate of 257 full-time, salaried employees at our venues. We rely on hourly-wage employees for kitchen staff, servers, bussers,\nrunners, polishers, hosts, bartenders, barbacks, reservationists, administrative support, and interns. The average headcount for employees in\nour domestic restaurants is 90. Combining full-time and part-time\n6\nTable of Contents\nemployees, we employ and manage directly approximately 4,500 persons and through ONE Hospitality we manage approximately 500\nemployees for a total of approximately 5,000 employees worldwide. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and none of our\nemployees are represented by a labor organization.\nOur human capital objectives include attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining our existing and new employees. We offer our\nemployees online training courses and on-the-job training. Restaurant management trainees undergo training in order to understand all\naspects of our restaurant operations. We provide our employees with cash-based performance bonuses. We also have an equity incentive\ncompensation plan to provide certain management-level or other key employees with stock-based awards. We have implemented programs\nto attract and retain both restaurant managers and hourly employees. We monitor our progress with metrics such as employee performance\nmeasures, turnover rates and restaurant customer surveys.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulation, including health, safety, labor, sanitation,\nbuilding and fire agencies in the state, county, municipality or jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. In certain states, our\nrestaurants are subject to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover\ndamages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We maintain the necessary restaurant,\nalcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and\naffect operating costs. The development and construction of new restaurants are also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use\nand environmental regulations. A failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the\nclosing of restaurants for an indeterminate period of time, fines or third-party litigation.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current\nreports on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding\nissuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\nWe maintain a website at www.togrp.com, including an investor relations section at ir.togrp.com, on which we routinely post\ninformation, such as webcasts of quarterly earnings calls and other investor events in which we participate and any related material. Our\nannual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as well as\nother reports relating to us that are filed with or furnished to the SEC can be accessed in the investor relations section of our website free of\ncharge as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nWe also make available on our website and in print to any stockholder who requests it, our Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee charters, as well as the Code of Conduct that applies to all directors, officers and employees of the\nCompany. We do not incorporate any information found or accessible through our websites into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. Holders of our common stock and prospective investors should carefully\nconsider the following risks and other information contained in this document, including our historical financial statements and related\nnotes included herein. The following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose part or all of your\ninvestment. The risks and uncertainties below are all those that we have identified as material but may not be the only risks and\nuncertainties facing us. Our business is subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall\neconomic and industry conditions.\nEconomic Conditions and Competition\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur business is dependent on discretionary spending patterns, business travel and general economic conditions.\nWe depend on consumer discretionary spending, business travel and the overall economic environment. Disruptions in the economy,\nincluding recessions, high unemployment, foreclosures, bankruptcies, inflation and other economic impacts, could affect consumers’ ability\nand willingness to spend discretionary dollars. Reductions in business travel and dining, which we believe accounts for a majority of our\nweekday revenues at our hotel-based restaurants and food and beverage services operations, would adversely affect our revenues.\nReductions in discretionary income and spending also would impact our casino-based restaurants and food and beverage services\noperations. If uncertain economic conditions were to persist for an extended period of time or worsen, consumers might make long-lasting\nchanges to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently. Adverse changes in consumer discretionary spending\ncould be affected by many different factors that are out of our control, including international, national and local economic conditions, any\nof which could harm our business prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Continued uncertainty in or a worsening\nof the economy, generally or in a number of our markets, and our customers’ reactions to these trends could adversely affect our business\nand cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close locations and delay any\nremodeling of existing restaurants. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to changing\neconomic and other conditions.\nWe have a limited number of venues, and we operate multiple venues in some cities and are therefore sensitive to economic and other\ntrends and developments in these cities.\nWe have a relatively small number of restaurants and F&B service locations, and we operate multiple venues in some cities. We\ntypically operate one to five venues in the cities where we operate. Accordingly, particularly in cities where we have multiple venues, our\nbusiness is susceptible to adverse changes in these markets whether as a result of declining economic conditions, declining stock market\nperformance, negative publicity, changes in customer preferences or for other reasons, and any such adverse changes may have a\ndisproportionate effect on our overall results of operations compared to some of our competitors that may have less restaurant\nconcentration or that do not operate in our markets. Any regional occurrences such as local labor strikes, natural disasters, prolonged\ninclement weather, acts of terrorism or other national emergencies, accidents, energy shortages, system failures or other unforeseen events\nin or around these cities could result in temporary or permanent closings of our venues, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations as a whole.\nCompetition in the restaurant industry is intense.\nThe restaurant and hospitality industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of facilities\nand type and quality of food. The industry is also characterized by the continual introduction of new concepts and is subject to rapidly\nchanging consumer preferences, tastes, trends and eating and purchasing habits. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and\nrespond quickly to changing consumer preferences, and other factors affecting the restaurant and hospitality industry, including new market\nentrants and demographic changes. Shifts in consumer preferences away from upscale steakhouses or beef in general, which are significant\ncomponents of our concepts’ menus and appeal, whether as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nA substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as independently owned restaurants, compete with us for\ncustomers, restaurant locations and qualified management and other restaurant staff. There is also competition from non-steak but upscale\nand high-energy restaurants, and other high-end hospitality services companies and high-energy nightlife concepts. To the extent that our\nrestaurants and F&B hospitality services operations are in hotels, casinos, resorts and similar locations, we are subject to competition in the\nbroader lodging and hospitality markets that could draw potential customers away from our locations.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and operating resources than we do, have been in business longer, have\ngreater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants and F&B hospitality services operations are\nlocated or where we may expand. In addition, improved product offerings in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry, combined\nwith the effects of negative economic conditions and other factors, may lead consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. Our inability\nto compete successfully with other restaurants, other F&B hospitality services operations and other segments of the industry may harm our\nability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit our development of new restaurants or concepts, or force us to close one or\nmore of our restaurants or F&B hospitality services operations.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe may also need to evolve our concepts to compete with popular new restaurant or F&B hospitality services operation formats,\nconcepts or trends that emerge from time to time, and we cannot provide any assurance that any changes we make to any of our concepts in\nresponse will be successful or not adversely affect our profitability.\nHealth and Safety\nHealth concerns arising from outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases, or regional or global health pandemics could severely affect\nour business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as coronavirus,\nnorovirus, Avian Flu or “SARS,” H1N1 or “swine flu,” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as\n“mad cow disease.” If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers may become infected, or may choose, or be\nadvised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which may adversely affect the guest traffic at our restaurants and the ability to\nadequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also may be adversely\naffected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on\noperations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of\ninfection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.\nTo the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and\navailability of certain food products and cause our customers to eat less of such products. For example, health concerns relating to the\nconsumption of beef or to specific events such as the outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales of our beef-related menu\nitems. In addition, public concern over “avian flu” may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from\npoultry. The inability to serve beef or poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our customers.\nIf we change our menu in response to such concerns, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to\nsufficiently attract new customers to produce the revenue needed to restore the profitability of our restaurant operations. We also may\ngenerate different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a menu change and may not be able to\nsuccessfully compete against such competitors.\nFailure to protect food supplies and adhere to food safety standards could result in food borne illnesses and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nFailure to protect our food supply or enforce food safety policies, such as proper food temperature and adherence to shelf-life dates,\ncould result in food-borne illnesses to our guests. Also, our reputation of providing high-quality food is an important factor in our guests\nchoosing our restaurants. Whether or not traced to our restaurants or those of our competitors, instances of food borne illness or other food\nsafety issues could reduce the demand for certain or all of our menu offerings. If any of our guest become ill from consuming our products,\nthe affected restaurants may be forced to close, and we may be subject to legal liability. An instance of food contamination from one of our\nrestaurants or suppliers could have far-reaching effects, as the contamination, or the perception of contamination could affect any or all of\nour restaurants. Publicity related to either product contamination, recalls, or food-borne illness, including Bovine-Spongiform\nEncephalopathy, which is also known as BSE or mad cow disease, aphthous fever, which is also known as hoof and mouth disease, and\nhepatitis A, listeria, salmonella and e-coli may also injure our brand and may affect the selection of our restaurants by our guests or\nlicensees based on fear of such illnesses. In addition, the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely\naffect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and/or lower margins for us\nand our licensees.\nLabor and Supplies\nChanges to wage, immigration and labor laws could increase our costs substantially.\nUnder the minimum wage laws in most domestic jurisdictions, we are permitted to pay certain hourly employees a wage that is less\nthan the base minimum wage because these employees receive tips as a substantial part of their income. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 33% of our employees earn this lower minimum wage in their respective locations since tips constitute a substantial part of\ntheir income. If cities, states or the federal government change their laws to require all employees to be paid the general employee\nminimum base wage regardless of supplemental tip income, our labor costs would increase substantially. Certain states in which we operate\nrestaurants also have adopted or are considering adopting minimum wage statutes that exceed the federal minimum wage. We may be\nunable or\n9\nTable of Contents\nunwilling to increase our prices to pass these increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case, our business and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nA restaurant company employer may claim a credit against the company’s federal income taxes for FICA taxes paid on certain tip\nwages (the “FICA tip credit”). We utilize the federal FICA tip credit to reduce our federal income tax expense. Changes in the tax law could\nreduce or eliminate the FICA tip credit, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nFurther, the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or\nenforcement programs. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to\nadditional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Even if we operate our\nrestaurants in strict compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and state requirements, some of our employees may not\nmeet federal work eligibility or residency requirements, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. Although we require all of our\nnew employees to provide us with the government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our\nemployees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to seizure and deportation and may\nsubject us to fines, penalties or loss of our business license in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, a government audit could result in a\ndisruption to our workforce or adverse publicity that could negatively impact our brand and our use of E-Verify and/or potential for receipt\nof letters from the Social Security Administration requesting information (commonly referred to as no-match letters) could make it more\ndifficult to recruit and/or retain qualified employees.\nPotential changes in labor laws or increased union recruiting activities could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to\ngreater organized labor influence. Although we do not currently have any unionized employees, labor legislation could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and\nimpact our ability to service our customers. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees could harm our reputation,\ndisrupt our operations and reduce our revenues and resolution of such disputes may increase our costs.\nThe loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nOur success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees, and on our ability to\nrecruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate\nmanagement and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of key employees or\na significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees to maintain our current business and support our projected growth could\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe restaurant industry has faced labor challenges coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, we have been able to fully staff\nour restaurants in this challenging labor environment, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to effectively manage our\nemployee base and avoid a labor shortage.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants and some of our food and beverage hospitality services locations under long-term non-cancelable\nleases under which we may remain obligated to perform even if we close those operations, and we may be unable to renew leases at the\nend of their terms.\nMost of our restaurants and some of our food and beverage hospitality operations are located in premises that we lease. Many of our\ncurrent leases are non-cancelable and typically have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with renewal options for terms ranging from 5 to\n10 years. We believe that future leases that we enter into will be on substantially similar terms. Fixed payments and/or minimum percentage\nrent payments under our operating leases and management agreements account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. This\nmay increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business.\nWe primarily depend on cash flow from operations to pay our obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our\ncredit facility or other sources, we may not be able to meet our operating lease and\n10\nTable of Contents\nmanagement agreement obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs,\nwhich could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we were to close or fail to open a restaurant, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable\nlease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue\nmaking rent payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant,\nwe may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we cannot renew such a lease we may be forced to close\nor relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks.\nAdditionally, negative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to the inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable\neconomic factors may adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in\ngood standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease\ncovenants to us. If any landlord files for bankruptcy protection, the landlord may be able to reject our lease in the bankruptcy proceedings.\nWhile we would under some circumstances have the option to retain our rights under the lease, we could not compel the landlord to\nperform any of its obligations and would be left with damages (which are subject to collectability risk) as our sole recourse. Our\ndevelopment of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of potential developers, landlords and\nhost sites. Such parties may delay or cancel development projects or renovations of existing projects due to the instability in the credit\nmarkets and economic uncertainty. This could reduce the number of high-quality locations available that we would consider for new\nrestaurants or cause the quality of the sites in which the restaurants and food and beverage hospitality services operations are located to\ndeteriorate. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our existing businesses or cause us to curtail new projects.\nWe depend upon frequent deliveries of food, alcohol and other supplies, which subjects us to the possible risks of shortages,\ninterruptions and price fluctuations.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our locations depends in part upon our ability to acquire fresh, quality products,\nincluding beef, seafood, produce and related items, from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications. We currently purchase our\nfood products from various suppliers. We have elected to purchase our beef from a limited number of suppliers. If there were any shortages,\ninterruptions or significant price fluctuations in beef or seafood or if our suppliers were unable to perform adequately or fail to distribute\nproducts or supplies to our restaurants, or terminate or refuse to renew any contract with us, this could cause a short-term increase in our\ncosts or cause us to remove certain items from our menu, increase the price of certain offerings or temporarily close a location, which could\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we purchase beer, wine and spirits from distributors who own the exclusive rights to sell such alcoholic beverage products\nin the geographic areas in which our restaurants operate. Our continued ability to purchase certain brands of alcoholic beverages depends\nupon maintaining our relationships with those distributors, of which there can be no assurance. If any of our alcohol beverage distributors\ncease to supply us, we may be forced to offer brands of alcoholic beverage which have less consumer appeal or that do not match our brand\nimage, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in commodity prices would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, which have a substantial effect\non our total costs. The purchase of beef represents approximately 25% of our food and beverage costs. The market for beef is subject to\nextreme price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, the price of feed, industry demand, energy demand and other factors.\nOur ability to forecast and manage our commodities could significantly affect our gross margins. Energy prices can also affect our\noperating results because increased energy prices may cause increased transportation costs for beef and other commodities and supplies,\nand increased costs for the utilities required to run each restaurant. Historically we have passed increased commodity and other costs on to\nour customers by increasing the prices of our menu items. While we believe these price increases have historically not affected customer\ntraffic, there can be no assurance that additional price increases would not affect future customer traffic. If prices increase in the future and\nwe are unable to anticipate or mitigate these increases, or if there are shortages for beef, our business and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\n11\nTable of Contents\nStrategy and Operations\nUnsuccessful implementation of any or all of the initiatives of our business strategy, including opening new restaurants and attracting\nnew F&B hospitality service opportunities, could negatively impact our operations.\nOne key element of our growth strategy is opening new restaurants and F&B hospitality services locations. We believe there are\nopportunities to add approximately seven to twelve new locations (restaurants and/or hospitality services operations) annually, with a focus\non operating under licensing or management agreements (referred to as our “capital light strategy”). However, there can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to open new restaurants or F&B hospitality services locations at the rate that we currently expect.\nOur success in growing our business through the opening of new restaurants and F&B hospitality locations is dependent upon a\nnumber of factors, including our ability to: cost-effectively operate in markets that we are not familiar with, find suitable license and food\nand beverage partners, find suitable locations, reach acceptable lease terms, maintain adequate capital, find qualified contractors, obtain\nlicenses and permits, manage construction and development costs, recruit and train appropriate staff and properly manage the new venue.\nUnanticipated costs or delays in the development or construction of future restaurants could impede our ability to open new restaurants\ntimely and cost-effectively, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically,\nsome of the factors that adversely affect the cost and time associated with the development and construction of our restaurants include:\nlabor disputes, shortages of materials or skilled labor, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen engineering problems, environmental\nproblems, construction or zoning problems, local government regulations, modifications in design, and other unanticipated increases in\ncost.\nAdditionally, our restaurants are expensive to build, and we, our managed unit partners and our licensees incur significant capital and\npre-opening expenses. Our business and profitability may be adversely affected if the “ramp-up” period for a new location lasts longer than\nwe expect or if the profitability of a new location dips after our initial “ramp-up” marketing program ends. New locations may not be\nprofitable, and their sales performance may not follow historical or projected patterns. If we are forced to close any new restaurants, we\nwill incur losses for certain buildout costs and pre-opening expenses incurred in connection with opening such operations.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with licensees.\nWe rely in part on our licensees and the manner in which they operate the STK restaurants to develop and promote our business. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had five licensed STK restaurants.\nOur licensees are required to operate our restaurants according to the specific guidelines we set forth, which are essential to\nmaintaining brand integrity and reputation, as well as in accordance with all laws and regulations applicable to us, and all laws and\nregulations applicable in the countries in which we operate. We provide training to these licensees to integrate them into our operating\nstrategy and culture. However, since we do not have day-to-day control over these restaurants, we cannot give assurance that there will not\nbe differences in product and service quality, operations, labor law enforcement, marketing or profitability or that there will be adherence to\nall of our guidelines and applicable laws. In addition, if our licensees fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the\nrestaurants, guest preference for our brand could suffer. Our licensees are subject to business risks similar to those we face such as\ncompetition; customer acceptance; fluctuations in the cost, quality and availability of raw ingredients; increased labor costs; difficulty\nobtaining acceptable site leases; and difficulty obtaining proper financing. Failure of licensed restaurants to operate effectively could\nadversely affect our cash flows from those operations or have a negative impact on our reputation and our business.\nThe success of our licensed restaurants depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with our licensees. The\nvalue of our brand and the rapport that we maintain with our licensees are important factors for potential licensees considering doing\nbusiness with us. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with licensees, we may be unable to renew license agreements and\nopportunities for developing new relationships with additional licensees may be adversely affected. This, in turn, could have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective developers and licensees, we\ncannot be certain that the developers and licensees we select will have the business acumen necessary to open and operate successful\nlicensed restaurants in their licensed areas, or that the licensees, once selected, will be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms\nfor prospective sites or to obtain the necessary approvals for such sites, or that financing will be available to construct and open new\nvenues.\n12\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent that our operations are located in hotels, casinos or similar destinations, our results of operations and growth are subject\nto the risks facing such venues.\nOur ability to grow and realize profits from our operations in hotels, casinos and other branded or destination venues are dependent on\nthe success of such venues’ business. We are subject to the actions and business decisions of our partners and third parties, in which we\nmay have little or no influence in the overall operation of the applicable venue and such actions and decisions could have an adverse effect\non our business and operations.\nLitigation and Brand Risk\nWe face the risk of adverse publicity in connection with our operations, including as a result of increased social media usage.\nThe quality of our food and ambiance of our restaurants are two of our competitive strengths. Therefore, adverse publicity, whether\naccurate or not, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our\nvenues or those operated by others could negatively impact us. Any shifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food we offer,\nparticularly beef, whether because of dietary or health reasons, sustainability concerns or otherwise, would make our restaurants less\nappealing and could reduce customer traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing.\nThe use of social media platforms allows individuals to access a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers\nvalue readily available information concerning goods and services that they have or plan to purchase and may act on such information\nwithout further investigation or authentication. Many social media platforms immediately publish content from their subscribers and\nparticipants, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company may be posted on\nsuch platforms at any time. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in our food quality, service or ambiance or in any way believe\nwe have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, this information can be immediately and broadly disseminated. This\ninformation may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business.\nWe face the risk of litigation in connection with our operations.\nWe are, from time to time, the subject of complaints or litigation from our consumers alleging, among other things, illness, injury or\nother food quality, health or operational concerns. The inappropriate use of social media by our employees or customers could lead to\nlitigation and result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation. In addition, third party and employee claims against us based\non, among other things, alleged discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination, or labor code violations may divert financial and\nmanagement resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our future performance. Regardless of whether any claims against us are\nvalid or whether we are liable, such claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In\naddition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be\nadequate levels of insurance commensurate with the nature and extent of our operations, insurance may not be available at all or in\nsufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. A significant increase in the number of these claims or in the\nnumber of such claims that are successful could materially adversely affect our brand, financial condition or operating results. Like most\nemployee practices liability insurance policies, our policy does not provide protection against wage and hour claims, and therefore\nlitigation in this area could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our brands, trademarks, service marks or other proprietary rights.\nWe have registered, or have applications pending to register, the trademarks STK, Kona Grill and Konavore with the United States\nPatent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries in connection with restaurant services. Our brands, which include our\ntrademarks, service marks and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, are important to our success and our competitive position.\nIn that regard, we believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable assets that are critical to our success.\nAccordingly, we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our brands. However, the actions we take may be\ninadequate to prevent imitation of our products and concepts by others, to prevent various challenges to our registrations or applications or\ndenials of applications for the registration of trademarks, service marks and proprietary rights in the U.S. or other countries, or to prevent\nothers from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary marks. In addition, others may assert rights\n13\nTable of Contents\nin our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights or may assert that we are infringing rights they have in their trademarks,\nservice marks, patents or other proprietary rights. Any such disputes could force us to incur costs related to enforcing our rights. In\naddition, the use of trade names, trademarks or service marks similar to ours in some markets may keep us from entering those markets.\nEach of our intellectual property marks is pledged as collateral securing our credit and guaranty agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank\nUSA (“Goldman Sachs”). Default under these agreements could enable Goldman Sachs to sell (at auction or otherwise) our trademarks,\nwhich would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business.\nCybersecurity and IT Systems\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from\naccessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nWe utilize information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our\nbusiness activities. As the use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the\nsecurity of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, all of which are vital to our operations\nand business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their\neffects.\nWe estimate that approximately 80% of our sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security\nbreaches in which credit and debit card information has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly\nfraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits\nor other proceedings relating to these types of incidents.\nThe scope and severity of risks posed to our systems from cyber threats has increased. Many of our information technology systems,\nincluding those used for our point-of-sale, delivery services and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information\nthat is entrusted to us by our guests, vendors and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain confidential\ninformation about our business, such as business strategies, development initiatives and designs. To date, these attacks have not had a\nmaterial impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future.\nOur third-party providers’ information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such risks. We provide some guest\nand employee data, as well as confidential information important to our business, to third parties to conduct our business. Individuals\nperforming work for us and these third parties also may access some of this data, including on personally owned digital devices. To the\nextent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the\nunauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers’ or employees’ data or confidential information stored in or\ntransmitted through such systems, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and\nbrand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data\nor payment for recovery of data), loss of business, disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use,\ndestruction or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks\nusing malicious code, vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system\nmisconfigurations, phishing or social engineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may\nintensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or\nsufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems and failures or interruptions in our IT systems could harm our ability to\neffectively operate our business and/or result in the loss of guests or employees.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems, including the point-of-sale and payment processing system in our restaurants,\ntechnologies supporting our digital and delivery services business, technologies that manage our supply chain, our rewards program,\ntechnologies that facilitate marketing initiatives, employee engagement and payroll processing, and various other processes and\ntransactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe procurement, production, distribution, safety and sale of our products depends significantly on the availability, reliability and security of\nthese systems. Many of these critical systems are provided and managed by third parties, and we are reliant on these third-party providers\nto implement protective measures that ensure the security and availability of their systems. Although we have operational safeguards in\nplace, these safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these third-party systems or platforms to operate effectively and be\navailable. Failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network\nfailures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-\nparty software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or the third-party service providers. If any of our critical IT systems\nwere to become unreliable, unavailable, compromised or otherwise fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could\nexperience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nOther Risks\nOur operations may be negatively impacted by seasonality, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or acts of terror.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters that may at times affect the regions in\nwhich our restaurants and F&B hospitality services operations are located, regions that supply or produce food products for our restaurants,\nor locations of our distribution network. As a result of the seasonality of our business due to weather, holiday events and other factors, our\nquarterly results for any one quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.\nIn addition, if adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes affect our restaurants, we could experience\nclosures, repair and restoration costs, food spoilage, and other significant reopening costs, any of which would adversely affect our\nbusiness. We could also experience shortages or delayed shipments at our restaurants if adverse weather or natural disasters affect our\ndistribution network, which could adversely affect our restaurants and our business as a whole. Additionally, during periods of extreme\ntemperatures (either hot or cold) or precipitation, we may experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could adversely affect our\nrestaurants and our business as a whole. Weather conditions are impossible to predict as is the negative impact on our business that such\nconditions might cause. Catastrophic weather conditions are likely to affect the supply of and costs for food products. If we do not\nanticipate or react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices or menu prices, our operating margins would likely\ndeteriorate.\nTerrorism, including cyber-terrorism or efforts to tamper with food supplies, could have an adverse impact on our brand and results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to numerous and changing U.S. federal and foreign government regulations. Failure to comply with or substantial\nchanges in government regulations could negatively affect our sales, increase our costs or result in fines or other penalties against us.\nEach of our venues is subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety, labor, building environmental (including\ndisposal, pollution, and the presence of hazardous substances) and fire agencies of the respective states, counties, cities, and municipalities\nin which it is located, as well as under federal law. These regulations govern the preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages, the sale and use of tobacco, zoning and building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters. Alcoholic\nbeverage control regulations govern various aspects of our restaurants’ daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and\nemployees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, our restaurants’\nlicenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause. A failure to comply\nwith one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of venues for an indeterminate period of\ntime, or third-party litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur foreign operations are subject to all of the same risks as our domestic restaurants and food and beverage hospitality services\noperations, and additional risks that include, among others, international economic and political conditions and the possibility of instability\nand unrest, differing cultures and consumer preferences, diverse government regulations and tax systems, the ability to source fresh\ningredients and other commodities in a cost-effective manner and the availability of experienced management.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to governmental regulation in the domestic and international jurisdictions where we operate, including antitrust and tax\nrequirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act\nand the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any new regulatory or trade initiatives could impact our operations in certain countries. Failure to\ncomply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to comply with certain debt covenants on our debt.\nOur credit agreement requires us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial\nratios. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. If we were to default under our covenants\nand such default were not cured or waived, our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable. If we breach these covenants and\nfail to comply with the credit agreement, and the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding, our business and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends on several factors, including compliance with specified\nleverage incurrence ratios. If we are not able to borrow under our revolving credit facility and if alternative financing is not available to us\non acceptable terms or at all, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements\nor fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our\nfinancial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in\ninternal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting. Refer to Part II —\nItem 9A, “Controls and Procedures” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for management’s assessment as of December 31, 2023. Any\nfailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results\naccurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over\nfinancial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock, and we could be subject to\nsanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other\nstockholders wanted it to occur.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders hold a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock.\nAccordingly, these stockholders are able to control or have a significant impact on all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the\nelection of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or\nmerging with us even if our other stockholders affirmed such action. In addition, such concentrated control may adversely affect the price\nof our common stock and sales by our insiders or affiliates, along with any other market transactions, could affect the market price of our\ncommon stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which\ncould limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover\nproposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is divided into three classes,\neach of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected each year. As a result, at a given\nannual meeting, only a minority of the Board may be considered for election. Since our staggered Board may prevent our stockholders\nfrom replacing a majority of our Board at any\n16\nTable of Contents\ngiven annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of\nstockholders.\nMoreover, our Board has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nUnder the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Board may authorize and issue up to 10,000,000 shares of one\nor more series or class of preferred stock with rights superior to those of holders of common stock in terms of liquidation and dividend\npreference, voting and other rights. The issuance of preferred stock would reduce the relative rights of holders of common stock vis-à-vis\nthe holders of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of common stock. In addition, to the extent that such preferred stock is\nconvertible into shares of common stock, its issuance would result in a dilution of the percentage ownership of holders of common stock on\na fully diluted basis. In addition, the issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or\npreventing a change in control of our company.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together,\nthese provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve a\npayment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nThe price of our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations.\nThe trading price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including market perception of our\nability to meet our growth projections and expectations, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading value\nin our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our business\nand the business of others in the industry. In addition, the stock market itself is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This\nvolatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons related and unrelated to their\noperating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nOur enterprise risk management framework considers cybersecurity risk alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk\nassessment process. In the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process and use large amounts of data. Digital data is stored and\nbacked up with third party partners. Maintaining the integrity and availability of our information technology systems and this information,\nas well as appropriate limitations on access and confidentiality of such information, is important to our operations and business strategy.\nWe implemented a program designed to assess, identify and manage risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our\ninformation technology systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality and integrity of these systems and the data residing\nin them. With the exception of local point-of-sale solutions, we do not host any solutions on premise as all applications are software as a\nservice.\nThe program is managed and monitored by a team led by our Chief Information Officer and includes mechanisms, controls,\ntechnologies, systems, policies and other processes designed to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security incidents or\nvulnerabilities affecting the systems and data residing in them. For example, we conduct risk-based penetration and vulnerability testing\nand ongoing risk assessments. We also conduct employee training on cyber and information security, among other topics. In addition, we\nconsult with outside advisors and experts to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks and their impact on our\nrisk environment. Lastly, we outsource to a cybersecurity firm all intrusion detection, intrusion prevention and system incident and event\nmonitoring.\nOur Chief Information Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and has over 25 years of experience managing\ninformation technology and cybersecurity matters, together with our third-party service providers, are responsible for assessing and\nmanaging cybersecurity risks. We consider cybersecurity, along with other significant risks that we face, within our overall enterprise risk\nmanagement framework. In the last fiscal year, we have not identified any prior cybersecurity incidents that materially affected us, but we\nface certain ongoing risks from\n17\nTable of Contents\ncybersecurity threats that, if realized, could materially affect us. Additional information on cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Part\nI, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the heading “Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and IT Systems.”\nThe Board of Directors, as a whole and at the committee level, has oversight for the most significant risks facing us and for our\nprocesses to identify, prioritize, assess, manage, and mitigate those risks. The Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent\ndirectors, has been designated by our Board to oversee cybersecurity risks. The Committee receives regular updates and reviews with\nmanagement the implementation and effectiveness of the Company’s controls to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity risks.\nItem 2. Properties\nWe do not own any real property. Each of our “owned” restaurants operates in premises leased by its operating subsidiary.

Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to claims common to our industry and in the ordinary course of our business. Companies in our industry, including us,\nhave been and are subject to class action lawsuits, primarily regarding compliance with labor laws and regulations. Defending lawsuits\nrequires significant management attention and financial resources and the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. We believe that\naccruals for these matters are adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements. We may have to make payments from time\nto time to settle or resolve legal matters. We do not believe the ultimate resolutions of these matters will have a material adverse effect on\nour consolidated financial position and results of operations. However, the resolution of lawsuits is difficult to predict. A significant\nincrease in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than is currently\nanticipated, could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nFor information regarding litigation refer to Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For more information about the impact of legal proceedings in our\nbusiness, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.\nItem 4.

As of February 29, 2024, there were 70\nholders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend in the\nforeseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, our\ncapital requirements, compliance with debt covenants, overall financial condition and such other factors as the Board of Directors may\nconsider. As a Delaware corporation, we are also limited by Delaware law as to the payment of dividends. We currently intend to retain our\nearnings to finance our growth.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn September 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $10.0 million of outstanding common\nstock. In May 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $5.0 million to this program. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased 1.2 million and 1.1 million shares for aggregate consideration of $7.9 million and\n$7.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased 2.3 million shares for $15.0 million under the program.\nThe repurchase program was completed in October 2023 with the repurchase of $0.2 million in shares.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read\nin conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nOverview\nWe currently own, operate, manage or license 63 venues including 28 STKs and 27 Kona Grills in major metropolitan cities in North\nAmerica, Europe and the Middle East and 8 F&B venues in four hotels and casinos in the United States and Europe.\nWe opened the following eight new venues in 2023:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina\n● Owned STK restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts\n● Owned STK restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Columbus, Ohio\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Riverton, Utah\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona\n● Two Bao Yum venues through a licensing agreement with Reef Kitchens\nRecently the Company exited its licensing agreement with REEF Kitchens and has no venues operating pursuant to that agreement.\nWe intend to open six to eight new venues in 2024. In March 2024, we opened the following:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Washington DC\nThere is currently one Company-owned STK restaurant, one Company-owned Kona Grill restaurant, and one Company-owned Salt\nWater Social restaurant under construction in the following cities:\n● Owned STK restaurant in Aventura, Florida\n● Owned Kona Grill restaurant Tigard, Oregon\n● Owned Salt Water Social restaurant in Denver, Colorado\nThe table below reflects our venues by restaurant brand and geographic location:\nVenues\nSTK(1) Kona Grill ONE Hospitality(2) Total\nDomestic\nOwned 17 27 2 46\nManaged 2 — 1 3\nLicensed 1 — — 1\nTotal domestic 20 27 3 50\nInternational\nOwned — — 1 1\nManaged 4 — 4 8\nLicensed 4 — — 4\nTotal international 8 — 5 13\nTotal venues\n28 27 8 63\n(1) Locations with an STK and STK Rooftop are considered one venue location. This includes the STK Rooftop in San Diego, CA, which is a licensed location.\n(2) Includes concepts under the Company’s F&B hospitality management agreements and other venue brands such as Bao Yum, Heliot, Hideout, Marconi, Radio and\nRivershore Bar & Grill.\n22\nTable of Contents\n2023 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue increased $16.1 million, or 5.1% to $332.8 million for 2023 compared to $316.6 million for 2022. The increase was\nprimarily attributable to the opening of three STK restaurants and three Kona Grill restaurants during 2023. Same store sales decreased\n2.7% in 2023 compared to 2022. STK same store sales decreased 3.0% while Kona Grill same store sales decreased 2.2%. Compared to pre\nCOVID-19 pandemic sales volumes, same-store sales increased 43.8% for 2023 compared to 2019; STK same store sales increased 64.1%\nwhich includes a 39.1% increase in traffic, while Kona Grill same store sales increased 23.6%.\nRestaurant operating profit decreased $0.4 million, or 0.8% to $50.4 million for 2023 compared to $50.8 million in 2022. Restaurant\noperating profit as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue was 15.9% in 2023 compared to 16.9% in 2022. Inflation outpaced our\nprice increases during the year putting pressure on our restaurant operating profit, therefore we have implemented several initiatives to\nimprove restaurant operating profit and overall profitability of our company. These initiatives are focused on purchasing efficiencies for\nboth food and operating supplies, maximizing productivity through smart scheduling, evaluating third-party vendor relationships and\nreducing travel costs. We believe these initiatives will improve profitability without impacting the guest experience.\nOperating income decreased $7.0 million to $9.3 million for 2023 from $16.3 million for 2022 primarily due to higher pre-opening\nexpenses associated with the increased number of venue openings in 2023, increased depreciation expense associated with eight venues\nopened since August 2022 and higher labor costs driven by wage inflation and investments in human capital in anticipation of growth.\nNet income attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc was $4.7 million in 2023 compared to $13.5 million in 2022.\nOur Growth Strategies and Outlook\nOur growth model is primarily driven by the following:\nExpansion of STK. We expect to continue to expand our operations domestically and internationally through a mix of owned, licensed\nand managed STK restaurants using a disciplined and targeted site selection process. We have identified over 75 additional major\nmetropolitan areas across the globe where we expect we could grow our STK brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future. We\nexpect to open five to six STKs annually, primarily through company-owned locations and management or licensing agreements, provided\nthat we have sufficient interest from prospective licensees, acceptable locations and quality restaurant managers available to support that\npace of growth.\nIn 2023, we opened Company-owned STK restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina, Boston, Massachusetts and Salt Lake City, Utah.\nIn March 2024, we opened a Company-owned STK restaurant at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Washington, D.C. Additionally, we have one\nSTK restaurant in Aventura, Florida under construction and several restaurants in the development phase or under lease that we plan to\nopen in 2024 or 2025.\nIn 2022, we opened two owned STK restaurants in San Francisco, California and Dallas, Texas and one managed STK restaurant in\nLondon, United Kingdom.\nExpansion of Kona Grill. We expect to expand our operations domestically using a disciplined and targeted site selection process. We\nbelieve we could grow the Kona Grill brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future. We expect to open three to five Kona Grills\nannually, primarily through company-owned locations, provided that we have acceptable locations and quality restaurant managers\navailable to support that pace of growth. We opened the first Kona Grill since the Company acquired the Kona Grill brand in Columbus,\nOhio in January 2023 and also opened two additional Kona Grill restaurants in Riverton, Utah and Phoenix, Arizona in 2023.\nExpansion through New F&B Hospitality Projects. We expect our F&B hospitality services business to be an important contributor of\nour growth and profitability, enabling us to generate leads to develop managed STK restaurants and management fee income with minimal\ncapital expenditures. We believe we are well positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with\nglobal hospitality providers to drive the continued growth of our F&B hospitality business. We continue to receive inbound inquiries\nregarding new opportunities globally,\n23\nTable of Contents\nand we continue to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. We expect to\nenter into one to two new F&B hospitality agreements annually. In 2023, we opened two licensed virtual Bao Yum locations in Denver,\nColorado in conjunction with REEF Kitchens. Recently the Company exited its licensing agreement with REEF Kitchens and has no\nvenues operating pursuant to that agreement.\nIncrease Same Store Sales and Increase Our Operating Efficiency. In addition to expanding into new cities and hospitality venues, we\nintend to continue to increase revenue and profits in our existing operations through continued focus on high-quality, high-margin food and\nbeverage menu items. We believe that our operating margins will improve through growth in same store sales, as defined below in Key\nPerformance Indicators, and a reduction of store-level operating expenses.\nAcquisitions. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities.\nAs our footprint increases, we expect to benefit by leveraging system-wide operating efficiencies and best practices through the\nmanagement of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of overall revenue.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use the following key performance indicators in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business:\nSame Store Sales (“SSS”). SSS represents total food and beverage sales at domestic owned and managed restaurants opened for at\nleast a full 18-month period at the beginning of each quarter, which removes the impact of new restaurant openings in comparing the\noperations of existing restaurants. For STK SSS, this measure includes total revenue from our owned and managed domestic STK\nlocations, excluding revenues from our owned STK restaurant located in the W Hotel in Los Angeles, California due to the impact of the\nF&B hospitality management agreement with the hotel. Revenues from locations where we do not directly control the event sales force are\nexcluded from this measure. We have presented four-year comparable sales to illustrate how sales at our restaurant base before the COVID-\n19 pandemic compare to sales post COVID-19 restrictions.\nOur comparable restaurant base for STK SSS consisted of twelve domestic restaurants for the year ended December 31, 2023. For\nKona Grill SSS, 24 domestic restaurants are included in the comparable restaurant base. STK and Kona Grill SSS decreased 3.0% and\n2.2%, respectively for 2023 compared to the prior year. On a four-year basis, STK SSS increased 64.1% while Kona Grill SSS increased\n23.6%.\nNumber of Restaurant Openings. Number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular fiscal\nperiod. For each restaurant opening, we incur pre-opening costs, which are defined below. Typically, new restaurants open with an initial\nstart-up period of higher than normalized sales volumes (also referred to in the restaurant industry as the “honeymoon” period), which\ndecrease to a steady level approximately 18 to 24 months after opening. However, operating costs during this initial period are also higher\nthan normal, resulting in restaurant operating margins that are generally lower during the start-up period of operation and increase to a\nsteady level approximately 18 to 24 months after opening. Some new restaurants may experience a “honeymoon” period that is either\nshorter or longer than this time frame.\nIn 2023, we opened three STK restaurants, three Kona Grill restaurants and two Bao Yum venues under a licensing agreement.\nRecently the Company exited its licensing agreement with REEF Kitchens and has no venues operating pursuant to that agreement. In\n2022, we opened three STK restaurants including two owned restaurants in San Francisco, California and Dallas, Texas, a managed STK\nrestaurant in London, United Kingdom and opened one Bao Yum venue under a licensing agreement.\nAverage Check Per Person and Average Spend. Average check is calculated by dividing total restaurant sales by total number of guests\nfor a specified period. Average spend per transaction is calculated by dividing total restaurant sales by total number of transactions for a\nspecified period. Our management team uses these indicators to analyze trends in customers’ preferences, customer expenditures and the\noverall effectiveness of menu changes and price increases. For our comparable STK restaurants, the average check was $130 for 2023\ncompared to $131 for 2022. The average spend per transaction was $63 for our comparable Kona Grill restaurants in 2023 compared to $61\nfor 2022.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAverage Comparable Restaurant Revenue. Average comparable restaurant revenue consists of the average sales of our comparable\nrestaurants over a certain period of time. This measure is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales in a given period by the\ntotal number of comparable restaurants in that period. For purposes of this calculation, STK Downtown restaurant and rooftop are\nconsidered a single venue. This indicator assists management in measuring changes in customer traffic, pricing and development of our\nbrand. Our average comparable STK restaurant revenues were $17.3 million and $19.1 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our\naverage comparable Kona Grill restaurant revenues were $5.2 million and $5.3 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nKey Financial Terms and Metrics\nWe evaluate our business using a variety of key financial measures:\nSegment reporting\nOur reportable operating segments are as follows:\n● STK. The STK segment consists of the results of operations from company-owned STK restaurant locations, competing in the\nfull-service dining category, as well as management, license and incentive fee revenue generated from the STK brand and pre-\nopening expenses associated with new restaurants.\n● Kona Grill. The Kona Grill segment includes the results of operations of Kona Grill restaurant locations and pre-opening\nexpenses associated with new restaurants.\n● ONE Hospitality. The ONE Hospitality segment is composed of the management, license and incentive fee revenue and results of\noperations generated from the Company’s other brands and venue concepts, not including STK or Kona Grill, which include Bao\nYum, Heliot, Hideout, Radio and Rivershore Bar & Grill. Additionally, this segment includes the results of operations generated\nfrom F&B hospitality management agreements with hotels, casinos and other high-end locations.\n● Corporate. The Corporate segment consists of the following: general and administrative costs, stock-based compensation, lease\ntermination expenses, transaction costs, COVID-19 related expenses and other income and expenses. This segment also includes\nSTK Meat Market, an e-commerce platform that offers signature steak cuts nationwide, and revenue generated from gift card\nprograms. The Corporate segment’s total assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, the Kona Grill tradename, and\ndeferred tax assets.\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our segment reporting.\nRevenues\nOwned restaurant net revenues. Owned restaurant net revenues consist of food and beverage sales by owned restaurants net of any\ndiscounts associated with each sale and of any ancillary F&B hospitality services at owned locations. Additionally, revenues from offsite\nbanquets and our gift card programs are included in owned restaurant net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2023, beverage sales\ncomprised 23% of food and beverage sales, and food sales comprised the remaining 77%. This indicator assists management in\nunderstanding the trends in gross margins of the restaurants.\nOur primary owned restaurant brands are STK and Kona Grill. We specifically look at comparable sales from both owned and\nmanaged restaurants to understand customer count trends and changes in average check as it relates to our primary restaurant brands.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue. Management, license and incentive fee revenues include fees received pursuant to\nmanagement and license agreements. Management agreements typically call for a management fee based on a percentage of revenue, a\nmonthly marketing fee based on a percentage of revenues and an incentive fee based on a managed venue’s net profits. Similarly, royalties\nfrom the licensee in license agreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensed restaurant’s revenue. These management,\nlicense and incentive fees are recognized as revenue in the period the restaurant’s sales occur. Initial licensing fees and upfront fees related\nto management and license agreements are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe evaluate the performance of our managed and licensed properties based on sales growth, a key driver for management and license\nfees, and on improvements in operating profitability margins, which, combined with sales, drives incentive fee growth.\nCost and expenses\nOwned restaurant cost of sales. Owned restaurant cost of sales includes all owned restaurant food and beverage expenditures. We\nmeasure cost of goods as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenues. Owned restaurant cost of sales are generally influenced by the cost\nof food and beverage items, menu mix, discounting activity and restaurant level controls. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Increases in\ncommodity prices would adversely affect our results of operations.”\nOwned restaurant operating expenses. We measure owned restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant net\nrevenues. Owned restaurant operating expenses include the following:\n● Payroll and related expenses. Payroll and related expenses consist of manager salaries, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-\nrelated items, including taxes, insurance and fringe benefits. We measure our labor cost efficiency by tracking total labor costs as\na percentage of owned restaurant net revenues.\n● Occupancy. Occupancy comprises all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable rent, deferred rent expense, which is\na non-cash adjustment included in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation as defined below, common area maintenance charges, real\nestate property taxes, utilities and other related occupancy costs and is measured by considering both the fixed and variable\ncomponents of certain occupancy expenses.\n● Direct operating expenses. Direct operating expenses consist of supplies, such as paper, smallwares, china, silverware and\nglassware, cleaning supplies, credit card fees and linen costs. Direct operating expenses are typically measured as a variable\nexpense based on owned restaurant net revenues.\n● Outside services. Outside services include music and entertainment costs, such as the use of live DJ’s, security services, outside\ncleaning services and delivery service fees.\n● Repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance consist of general repair work to maintain our facilities, and computer\nmaintenance contracts. We expect these costs to increase at each facility as they get older.\n● Marketing. Marketing includes the cost of promoting our brands and, at times, can include the cost of goods used specifically for\ncomplementary purposes. Marketing costs will typically be higher during the first 18 months of a restaurant’s operations.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses are comprised of all corporate overhead expenses, including payroll\nand related benefits, stock-based compensation expense, professional fees, such as legal and accounting fees, insurance and travel\nexpenses. Certain centrally managed general and administrative expenses are allocated specifically to restaurant locations and are reflected\nin owned restaurant operating expenses and include shared services such as reservations, events and marketing. We expect general and\nadministrative expenses to be leveraged as we grow, become more efficient, and continue to focus on best practices and cost savings\nmeasures.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists principally of charges related to the depreciation of\nfixed assets including leasehold improvements, equipment and furniture and fixtures and loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nPre-opening expenses. Pre-opening expenses consist of costs incurred prior to opening an owned or managed STK or Kona Grill\nrestaurant at either a leased or F&B location. Pre-opening expenses are comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation costs,\nemployee payroll, training costs for new employees and lease costs incurred prior to opening. Pre-opening expenses also include payroll\nand travel costs associated with our new restaurant opening training team. Pre-opening expenses have varied from location to location\ndepending on a number of factors, including the proximity to our existing restaurants; the amount of rent expensed during the construction\nand in-restaurant training periods; the size and physical layout of each location; the number of management and hourly employees required\nto operate each restaurant; the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process; the cost of travel and lodging for\n26\nTable of Contents\ndifferent metropolitan areas; the timing of the restaurant opening; and the extent of unexpected delays, if any, in obtaining necessary\nlicenses and permits to open the restaurant.\nOther Items\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit\nto supplement other measures of financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are not required by,\nor presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We define EBITDA\nas net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as\nEBITDA before non-cash rent expense, pre-opening expenses, lease termination expenses, stock-based compensation, COVID-19 related\nexpenses and non-recurring gains and losses. Not all of the items defining Adjusted EBITDA occur in each reporting period but have been\nincluded in our definitions of these terms based on our historical activity. We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net\nrevenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses.\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are appropriate measures of our operating performance\nbecause they eliminate non-cash or non-recurring expenses that do not reflect our underlying business performance. We believe Restaurant\nOperating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to\nevaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate\nour restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison of our operating\nperformance on a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business and to evaluate the\nperformance of our restaurants. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be\ncomparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our\nresults as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and is a metric used in our debt compliance\ncalculation. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested\nparties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit, alongside other GAAP measures\nsuch as net income, to measure profitability, as a key profitability target in our budgets, and to compare our performance against that of\npeer companies despite possible differences in calculation.\nPlease refer to the table on page 30 for our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for a reconciliation of\noperating income to Restaurant Operating Profit.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain statements of operations data for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenues:\nOwned restaurant net revenue $ 317,366 $ 300,859\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue 15,403 15,779\nTotal revenues 332,769 316,638\nCost and expenses:\nOwned operating expenses:\nOwned restaurant cost of sales 75,727 75,365\nOwned restaurant operating expenses 191,250 174,689\nTotal owned operating expenses 266,977 250,054\nGeneral and administrative (including stock-based compensation of $5,032 and $3,985 for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) 30,751 29,081\nDepreciation and amortization 15,664 12,134\nPre-opening expenses 8,855 5,519\nTransaction costs 207 123\nLease termination expenses — 257\nCOVID-19 related expenses — 2,534\nOther expenses 1,021 630\nTotal costs and expenses 323,475 300,332\nOperating income 9,294 16,306\nOther expenses, net:\nInterest expense, net of interest income 7,028 2,113\nTotal other expenses, net 7,028 2,113\nIncome before provision for income taxes 2,266 14,193\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (1,760) 874\nNet income 4,026 13,319\nLess: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (692) (215)\nNet income attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 4,718 $ 13,534\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth certain statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated.

Owned restaurant net revenue increased $16.5 million, or 5.5%, to $317.4 million for 2023 from\n$300.9 million for 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a full year of sales for two STK restaurants that opened in the second\nhalf of 2022, the opening of three STK restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the opening of three Kona Grill restaurants during\n2023. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.7% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue. Management and license fee revenues decreased $0.4 million, or 2.4%, to\n$15.4 million for 2023 from $15.8 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the non-renewal of the management\nagreement for Radio at the ME London hotel.\nCost and Expenses\nOwned restaurant cost of sales. Food and beverage costs for owned restaurants increased $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to $75.7 million for\n2023 from $75.4 million for 2022. The increase was due to the incremental sales increases noted above from the opening of eight new\nvenues since August 2022. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased 110 basis points to 23.9% for 2023 from 25.0% for 2022\nprimarily due to product mix management, pricing and operational cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increased commodity prices.\nOwned restaurant operating expenses. Owned restaurant operating expenses increased $16.6 million, or 9.5%, to $191.3 million for\n2023 from $174.7 million for 2022. Owned restaurant operating costs as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue increased 220 basis\npoints from 58.1% in 2022 to 60.3% for 2023 primarily due to higher labor costs driven by wage inflation and investments in anticipation\nof growth, increased marketing expenses and general operating cost inflation.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative costs increased $1.7 million, or 5.7%, to $30.8 million for 2023 from\n$29.1 million for 2022. The increase was attributable to increased stock-based compensation expense and additional investments required\nahead of new restaurant openings partially offset by lower incentive-based performance compensation. As a percentage of revenues,\ngeneral and administrative costs were 9.2% in both 2023 and 2022.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.6 million to $15.7 million for 2023 from\n$12.1 million for 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of eight new owned venues since August 2022 and capital\nexpenditures to maintain and enhance the guest experience in our restaurants.\nPre-opening expenses. We incurred $8.9 million of pre-opening expenses primarily related to payroll, training, and non-cash rent for\nsix STK and Kona Grill restaurants which opened in 2023 as well as STK and Kona Grill restaurants currently under development. Total\npre-opening expenses related to non-cash pre-open rent was $1.8 million.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPre-opening expenses for 2022 were $5.5 million primarily related costs associated with STK San Francisco which opened August\n2022, STK Dallas which opened November 2022, and restaurants opened in 2023. Total pre-opening expenses related to non-cash rent\nwere $1.1 million.\nDetail of pre-opening expenses by category is provided in the tables below for 2023 and 2022 (in thousands).\nYear ended December 31, 2023 Preopen Expenses Preopen Rent Total\nTraining Team $ 3,845 $ — $ 3,845\nRestaurants 3,213 1,797 5,010\nTotal $ 7,058 $ 1,797 $ 8,855\nYear ended December 31, 2022 Preopen Expenses Preopen Rent Total\nTraining Team $ 1,186 $ — $ 1,186\nRestaurants 3,200 1,133 4,333\nTotal $ 4,386 $ 1,133 $ 5,519\n(1) Cash rent paid was $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther expenses. Other expenses were $1.0 million for 2023 primarily related to litigation expenses compared to other expenses of $0.6\nmillion for 2022 composed primarily of trademark defense and litigation expenses.\nInterest expense, net of interest income. Interest expense, net of interest income, was approximately $7.0 million and $2.1 million for\n2023 and 2022, respectively. We borrowed $50.0 million on the delayed draw term loan facility in December 2022. The weighted average\ninterest rate for 2023 was 11.9% compared to 6.9% for 2022.\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes. The benefit for income taxes for 2023 was ($1.8) million compared to provision for income taxes\nof $0.9 million for 2022. Our effective tax rate was (77.7)% and 6.2% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our\neffective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. tax rate of 21% primarily due to the following: (i) tax credits for FICA taxes on certain\nemployees’ tips; (ii) taxes owed in foreign jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy; (iii) taxes owed in state and local\njurisdictions; and (iv) windfall tax benefits from equity compensation offset by compensation limited for certain individuals with\ncompensation in excess of $1 million.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest increased to a net loss of $0.7 million for\n2023 compared to net loss of $0.2 million for 2022.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nExecutive Summary\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our lease obligations, working capital and capital expenditure needs and to pay\nprincipal and interest on our outstanding debt. Subject to our operating performance, which, if significantly adversely affected, would\nadversely affect the availability of funds, we expect to finance our operations for at least the next 12 months, including the costs of opening\ncurrently planned new restaurants, through cash provided by operations, construction allowances provided by landlords of certain locations\nand borrowings under our credit agreement. We also may borrow on our revolving credit facility or issue equity to support ongoing\nbusiness and fund additional expansion. We believe these sources of financing are adequate to support our immediate business operations\nand plans. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21.0 million. We had $73.5 million in long-term debt, which\nconsisted of borrowings under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the availability on our revolving\ncredit facility was $10.6 million, subject to the restrictions described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCapital expenditures in 2023 were $53.5 million of which $41.8 million primarily related to the construction of six new STK and Kona\nGrill restaurants and several restaurants that were under development as of December 31, 2023. We spent $8.4 million on maintenance\ncapital expenditures for existing restaurants which included additional furniture, fixtures and equipment commensurate with the higher\nsales volumes at our restaurants. In addition, we spent approximately $2.9 million for furniture, fixtures and equipment for restaurants that\nwe plan to open in the future. Net capital expenditures, inclusive of $4.7 million in landlord contributions, was $48.8 million for 2023. We\nexpect to receive between $1.5 million to $2.1 million in landlord contributions in the next three months.\nCapital expenditures by type for 2023 and 2022 is provided below (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 STK Kona Grill Other Total\nNew Venues $ 24,574 $ 17,234 $ 2,865 $ 44,673\nMaintenance 4,294 4,134 — 8,428\nOther — — 449 449\nTotal(1) $ 28,868 $ 21,368 $ 3,314 $ 53,550\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 STK Kona Grill Other Total\nNew Venues $ 12,555 $ 5,226 $ 2,258 $ 20,039\nMaintenance 5,279 4,748 — 10,027\nOther 409 413 1,741 2,563\nTotal(1) $ 18,243 $ 10,387 $ 3,999 $ 32,629\n(1) Exclusive of landlord contributions of $4.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur operations have not required significant working capital, and, like many restaurant companies, we may have negative working\ncapital during the year. Revenues are received primarily in credit card or cash receipts, and restaurant operations do not require significant\nreceivables or inventories, other than our wine inventory. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and\nsupplies, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically\ngenerate a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter.\nOur future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of expansion, conditions in the retail property\ndevelopment market, construction costs, the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants, and the nature of the specific leases\nand associated tenant improvement allowances available, if any, as negotiated with landlords. We have made significant investments in our\ntraining and development teams to support new restaurants openings. We believe these investments are necessary to support the successful\nopening of our new restaurants. If we modify our growth plans, the personnel that comprise our training team could be deployed to operate\nexisting restaurants.\n33\nTable of Contents\nTo help manage future cash requirements, we limit the number of owned company venues under construction at any given time to four\nrestaurants. We also set a maximum number of signed leases for new restaurant development to twelve in order to minimize our cash rent\ncommitment to approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million annually for restaurants under development.\nCredit Agreement\nOn October 4, 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Kona Grill, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Goldman\nSachs Bank USA. On August 6, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date\nfor both the term loan and revolving credit facility to August 2026, to eliminate all financial covenants except a maximum net leverage\nratio of 2.00 to 1.00, and to eliminate restrictions on the maximum amount of capital expenditures, the maximum number of Company-\nowned new locations, and credit extensions under the revolving credit facility. As amended, the Credit Agreement provided for a secured\nrevolving credit facility of $12.0 million and a $25.0 million term loan (reduced from $48.0 million). The term loan is payable in quarterly\ninstallments of $0.1 million, with the final payment due in August 2026.\nOn December 13, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement that:\n● Allows for a new $50.0 million delayed draw term facility, available to draw for twelve months and subject to a 1.75x Net\nLeverage Ratio incurrence test (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for permitted acquisitions, stock repurchases and new\nrestaurant capital expenditures;\n● Allows the Company to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire its own capital stock in an aggregate amount of up to $50\nmillion subject to a 1.75x Net Leverage Ratio incurrence test and no default or event of default;\n● Changes the interest rate from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR“) plus a margin to Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”) plus an applicable margin.\nThe Company borrowed $50.0 million on the delayed draw term facility on December 28, 2022. The delayed draw term loan is\npayable in quarterly installments of $0.25 million beginning December 31, 2023, with the final payment due in August 2026.\nLoans under the amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum using the SOFR rate subject to a 1.00% floor plus an\ninterest rate margin of 6.50%.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants under the amended Credit Agreement. Based on current\nprojections, we believe that we will continue to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, as amended, throughout the twelve\nmonths following the issuance of the financial statements.\nSee Note 5 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our long-term debt and commitments and\ncontingencies.\nCapital Expenditures and Lease Arrangements\nWhen we open new Company-owned restaurants, our capital expenditures for construction increase. For owned STK restaurants,\nwhere we build from a shell state, we have typically targeted a restaurant size of 8,000 square feet with a gross cash investment of\napproximately $515 to $675 per square foot, exclusive of $200 per square foot in landlord contributions. STK restaurants opened in 2023\nhad a gross cost per square foot of $690 and $125 per square foot in landlord contributions with an average size of 10,386 square feet. For\nowned Kona Grill restaurants, where we build from a shell state, we have typically targeted a restaurant size of 7,000 square feet with a\ngross cash investment of approximately $510 per square foot, exclusive of $150 per square foot in landlord contributions. Kona Grill\nrestaurants opened in 2023 had a gross cost per square foot of $600 and $90 per square foot in landlord contributions with an average size\nof 8,631 square feet. In situations where we add functional space and build an STK or Kona Grill restaurant with a mezzanine, covered\npatio, or rooftop, costs per square feet will increase. Typical cash pre-opening costs are $0.6 million to $0.8 million, excluding the impact\nof cash and non-cash pre-opening rent. In addition, some of our existing restaurants will require capital improvements to either maintain or\nimprove the facilities. We may add seating or provide\n34\nTable of Contents\nenclosures for outdoor space in the next twelve months for some of our locations, when we believe that will increase revenues for those\nlocations.\nOur hospitality F&B services projects typically require limited capital investment from us. Capital expenditures for these projects are\nprimarily funded by cash flows from operations and equipment financing, depending upon the timing of these expenditures and cash\navailability.\nWe typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for periods of 10 to 20 years under operating lease arrangements, with a limited\nnumber of renewal options. Our rent structure varies, but our leases generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent\nrent based on sales, as well as other expenses related to the leases such as our pro-rata share of common area maintenance, property tax and\ninsurance expenses. Many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset\nthe cost of developing and opening the related restaurants. Generally, landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased\nminimum rents. However, there can be no assurance that such allowances will be available to us on each project that we select for\ndevelopment.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in\nthousands):\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 30,781 $ 25,251\nInvesting activities (53,550) (32,629)\nFinancing activities (11,248) 39,102\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (57) (217)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (34,074) $ 31,507\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.8 million for 2023 compared to $25.3 million for 2022. The\nincrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to higher accounts payable\nand accrued expenses attributable to the timing of payments.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for 2023 was $53.5 million primarily for the construction of six restaurants\nopened in 2023 and new restaurants under development, as well as capital expenditures for existing restaurants compared to $32.6 million\nfor 2022.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used by financing activities was $11.2 million for 2023 primarily attributable to $7.9 million of shares\npurchased under our stock buyback plan compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $39.1 million for 2022. During 2022, we\nborrowed $50.0 million under the amended Credit Agreement, partially offset by $7.1 million in purchases of common stock and $2.0\nmillion to pay employee taxes for shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and\nresults and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different\nconditions or using different assumptions.\nOur significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We base our\nestimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate those\nestimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these\n35\nTable of Contents\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of\njudgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the\nrespective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted rates expected to\napply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of\nrealizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that\nsome portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions\nregarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income amongst various tax\njurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability. We adjust our liability\nfor unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax provision is effectively settled, the statute of\nlimitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $0.6 million that relates to foreign tax credits we do not expect to utilize as\na result of generating income in a jurisdiction with a higher income tax rate than the U.S. The recording of deferred taxes requires\nsignificant management judgment regarding the interpretation of applicable statutes, the status of various income tax audits, and our\nparticular facts and circumstances.\nOur income taxes are impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act in December 2017 (the “TCJA”), which, amongst other\nthings, enacted global intangible low-taxed income provisions that do not allow us to defer the earnings of our subsidiaries in the U.K. and\nItaly.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Disposal of Property and Equipment\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment and right-of-use assets for operating leases, are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The impairment\nevaluation is generally performed at the individual restaurant level, as we believe this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. We\nbelieve that historical cash flows, in addition to other relevant facts and circumstances, are the primary basis for estimating future cash\nflows. Relevant facts and circumstances include, among others, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future\noperating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant\nnegative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of restaurant assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nindividual restaurant’s assets to the estimated identifiable undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those restaurant\nassets. This process requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If the carrying amount\nof an individual restaurant’s assets exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount\nby which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value is determined for these assets in accordance with\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and the operating lease right-of-use assets as\nof December 31, 2023 were $139.9 million and $95.1 million, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we have decided to close or dispose of restaurants. Typically, such decisions are based on operating performance or\nstrategic considerations and must be made before the actual costs or proceeds of disposition are known, and management must make\nestimates of these outcomes. Such outcomes could include the sale of a leasehold, mitigating costs through a tenant or subtenant, or\nnegotiating a buyout of a remaining lease term. In these instances, management evaluates possible outcomes, frequently using outside real\nestate and legal advice, and records provisions for the effect of such outcomes. The accuracy of such provisions can vary materially from\noriginal estimates, and management regularly monitors the adequacy of the provisions until final disposition occurs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not identify any event or changes in circumstances that indicated that the\ncarrying values of our restaurant long-lived assets were impaired and therefore, no impairment loss related to long-lived assets has been\nrecognized.\n36\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances\nbetween annual tests indicate a potential impairment. First, we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an\nimpairment exists. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, historical financial performance, expected future cash flows, changes\nin management or key personnel, macroeconomic and industry conditions and the legal and regulatory environment. If the qualitative\nassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nThe quantitative assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. Key assumptions include\nprojected revenue growth and operating expenses, discount rates, royalty rates and other factors that could affect fair value or otherwise\nindicate potential impairment. These estimates are subjective, and our ability to realize future cash is affected by factors such as changes in\neconomic conditions and operating performance. Changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future,\nor in the estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our trademarks, could\nresult in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our trademarks.\nLeases\nContracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a lease at inception, and leases are classified as either operating or\nfinancing. For operating leases, we recognize a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, and a right of use\nasset equal to the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as prepaid rents, initial direct costs and lease incentives received from\nthe lessor. For leases that do not have a rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of\nthe lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a\nsimilar term on an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nThe lease term at the lease commencement date is determined based on the non-cancellable period for which we have the right to use\nthe underlying asset, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option,\nperiods covered by an option to terminate the lease if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option, and periods covered by an\noption to extend (or not to terminate) the lease in which the exercise of the option is controlled by the lessor.\nCertain of our leases also provide for percentage rent, which are variable lease costs determined as a percentage of gross sales in\nexcess of specified, minimum sales targets. These percentage rents are recognized as rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified\nsales target provided achievement of the sales target is considered probable.\nWe currently lease all of our restaurant locations under leases classified as operating leases. Management makes judgments regarding\nthe probable term for each lease and considers a number of factors to evaluate whether renewal options in the lease contracts are reasonably\ncertain of exercise, such as length of time before option exercise, expected value of the leased asset at the end of the initial lease term,\nimportance of the lease to overall operations, costs to negotiate a new lease, and any contractual or economic penalties. The lease term can\nimpact the lease classification and accounting for a lease as either an operating or financing lease, the incremental borrowing rate, the rent\nholidays and/or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating the rent expense and the related lease liability\nand right-of-use asset, and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are depreciated. These judgments may produce\nmaterially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense and materially different lease liabilities and right-of-use assets\nthan would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\n37\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to market price fluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices. Given the historical volatility of\nbeef, seafood, produce and other food product prices, these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs. While we have\ntaken steps to qualify multiple suppliers who meet our standards as suppliers for our restaurants and enter into agreements with suppliers\nfor some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations, we do not enter into long-term agreements for the purchase of such supplies.\nThere can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions\noutside of our control and we may be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government\nregulation. Because we typically set our menu prices in advance of our food product prices, our menu prices cannot immediately take into\naccount the changing costs of food items. To the extent that we are unable to pass the increased costs on to our customers through price\nincreases, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market price\nfluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices at this time.\nInflation\nInflation significantly affected our operations in 2022 and 2023, to a lesser extent. The impact of inflation on labor, food and\noccupancy costs could, in the future, significantly affect our operations. We pay many of our employees hourly rates related to the\napplicable federal or state minimum wage. Food costs as a percentage of revenues have been somewhat stable due to procurement\nefficiencies and menu price increases, although no assurance can be made that our procurement will continue to be efficient or that we will\nbe able to raise menu prices in the future. Costs for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance all impact our occupancy costs.\nWe believe that our current strategy, which is to seek to maintain operating margins through a combination of menu price increases, cost\ncontrols, careful evaluation of property and equipment needs, and efficient purchasing practices, has been an effective tool for dealing with\ninflation. There can be no assurance, however, that future inflationary or other cost pressure will be effectively offset by this strategy.\nInterest Rate Risk\nUnder our Credit Agreement, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our borrowings. Borrowings under the\nCredit Agreement are subject to rates based on SOFR plus an interest rate margin of 6.5%. As of December 31, 2023, we had $73.5 million\nof borrowings subject to variable interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk for our restaurants operating in the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, Mexico and\nthe Middle East. If foreign currency exchange rates depreciate in these countries or regions, or any other country or region in which we\nmay operate in the future, we may experience declines in our international operating results but such exposure would not be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements required by this Item are set forth in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n38\nTable of Contents\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,\nas our controls are designed to do, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the risk and cost benefit relationship\nrelated to controls and procedures.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as\nof December 31, 2023 and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and\nfairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial\nstatements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and\nproviding reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our\nfinancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making its\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations (the “COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment,\nour CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual\nReport, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n39\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated March 12, 2024,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nMarch 14, 2024\n40\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\ntwo years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 12,\n2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nLong-lived assets, which includes property and equipment and right-of-use assets for operating leases, are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The impairment\nevaluation is performed at the individual restaurant level. Recoverability of restaurant assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying\namount of an individual restaurant’s assets to the estimated\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nundiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those restaurant assets. If the carrying amount of an individual restaurant’s\nassets exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying\namount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value is determined for these assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value\nMeasurement. Property and equipment, net, and the Operating lease right-of-use assets as of December 31, 2023 were $139.9 million and\n$95.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, no impairment loss related to long-lived assets was recognized.\nWe identified the impairment of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions\nmanagement makes to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased\nextent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators and the\nreasonableness of management’s undiscounted future cash flows analysis.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to impairment of long-lived assets included the following, among others:\n● We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s long lived asset impairment indicator evaluation and\nundiscounted future cash flow analysis.\n● We evaluated the Company’s evaluation of impairment indicators by:\n- Testing long-lived restaurant assets for indications of impairment, including evaluating locations with current period\nlosses or projected losses\n- Performing inquiries of management regarding the process and assumptions used to identify potential indicators of\nimpairment and evaluating the consistency of the assumptions with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n- Inspecting minutes of the board of directors, the Company's public statements, operating plans, and industry data to\nidentify any evidence that may contradict management's assumptions.\n● We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s undiscounted future cash flows analysis by comparing management’s\nprojections to (1) the Company’s historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, (3)\nexternal communications made publicly by management, and (4) industry data.\n● We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying source information used by management to identify quantitative\nindicators of impairment.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nMarch 14, 2024\nWe

Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Description of Business\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is a global restaurant company that develops, owns\nand operates, manages and licenses upscale and polished casual, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and\nbeverage (“F&B”) services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations. Turn-key F&B services are food\nand beverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by the Company at a particular hospitality venue and customized for\nthe client. The Company’s primary restaurant brands are STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social\natmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse, and Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept\nfeaturing American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company owned, operated, managed or licensed 65 venues including 27 STKs and 27 Kona Grills in\nmajor metropolitan cities in North America, Europe and the Middle East and 11 F&B venues in four hotels and casinos in the United States\nand Europe. For those restaurants and venues that are managed or licensed, the Company generates management fees based on top-line\nrevenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the location’s revenues and net profits.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and have been prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and\nassumptions for the reporting period and as of the reporting date. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Assets and liabilities are\nvalued based upon observable and non-observable inputs. Valuations using Level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices that are\navailable in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs utilize significant other observable\ninputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly. Valuations using Level 3\ninputs are based on significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant\nmanagement judgment. There were no significant transfers between levels during any period presented.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less\nwhen purchased. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and at the restaurants as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company’s receivables arise from credit cards, management agreements, trade customers and other reimbursable amounts due\nfrom hotel operators where the Company operates a food and beverage service. Accounts receivable from credit card processors and third-\nparty delivery services at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Receivables from the Company’s\nmanagement, license and hotel partners were $8.2 million and $7.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInventory\nInventories, which consist of food, liquor and other beverages, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined\nby the first in, first out method. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs to sell. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, food inventories were $4.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively,\nand beverage inventories were $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nAdditions to property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost while costs incurred to repair and\nmaintain the Company’s operations and equipment are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the assets and the related accumulated\ndepreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on retirements is reflected in operating income in the year of disposition.\nComputers and equipment as well as furniture and fixtures are depreciated over their useful lives from three to fifteen years. Leasehold\nimprovements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the associated lease. Lease terms\nbegin on the date the Company takes possession under the lease and include option periods where failure to exercise such options would\nresult in an economic penalty.\nOther Assets\nOther assets include liquor license acquisition costs and costs to fulfill obligations under the Company’s management and license\nagreements.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of the indefinite-lived “Kona Grill” trade name and other finite-lived intangible assets that are amortized using\nthe straight-line method over their estimated useful life of 10 years. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross carrying amount of the\nKona Grill trade name intangible was $17.4 million. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the gross carrying amount of the other finite-lived\nintangible assets were $0.1 million. The amortization expense was nominal and $0.2 million for the years ending December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. The Company’s estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is a nominal\namount annually.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment and right-of-use assets for operating leases, are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The impairment\nevaluation is generally performed at the individual restaurant level, as we believe this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. We\nbelieve that historical cash flows, in addition to other relevant facts and circumstances, are the primary basis for estimating future cash\nflows. Relevant facts and circumstances include, among others, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future\noperating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant\nnegative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of restaurant assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nindividual restaurant’s assets to the estimated identifiable undiscounted future cash flows exclusive of operating lease payments, expected\nto be generated by those restaurant assets. This process requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of\njudgment. If the carrying amount of an individual restaurant’s assets exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, exclusive of\noperating lease payments, an impairment charge is\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nrecognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value is determined for these\nassets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and the operating\nlease right-of-use assets as of December 31, 2023 were $139.9 million and $95.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, no impairment loss related to long-lived assets has been recognized.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not identify any event or changes in circumstances that indicated\nthat the carrying values of its restaurant assets were impaired.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense based\non the term of the related debt agreement using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The Company\nhas recorded debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of\ndebt issuance costs related to the term loan and delayed draw term loan is recorded in long-term debt, net of current portion on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized\nfor differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, using the enacted statutory rate in\neffect for the year these differences are expected to be taxable or refunded. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the\nchanges in the asset or liability, respectively, from period to period. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future\ntax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. If the Company determines that a deferred\ntax asset or liability could be realized in a greater or lesser amount than recorded, the deferred tax asset or liability is adjusted and a\ncorresponding adjustment is made to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nincome in the period during which the determination is made.\nThe Company reduces its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it determines that it is more likely than not that some portion\nor all of these tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, the Company considers various qualitative and quantitative\nfactors, such as:\n● the level of historical taxable income;\n● the projection of future taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets would be deductible;\n● events within the restaurant industry;\n● the health of the economy; and,\n● historical trending.\nThe recording of deferred taxes requires significant management judgment regarding the interpretation of applicable statutes, the status\nof various income tax audits, and particular facts and circumstances.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the\nposition would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit\nthat has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If the Company derecognizes an uncertain tax position,\nthe Company’s policy is to record any applicable interest and penalties within the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is derived from restaurant sales, management services and license related operations.\nThe Company recognizes restaurant revenues, net of discounts, when goods and services are provided. Sales tax amounts collected\nfrom customers that are remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net revenue.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nManagement agreements typically call for a management fee based on a percentage of revenue, a monthly marketing fee based on a\npercentage of revenues and an incentive fee based on a managed venue’s net profits. Similarly, royalties from the licensee in license\nagreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensed restaurant’s revenue. These management, license and incentive fees are\nrecognized as revenue in the period the restaurant’s sales occur.\nThe Company recognizes initial licensing fees and upfront fees related to management and license agreements on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the agreement as a component of management, license and incentive fee revenue on the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income.\nThe Company has a loyalty program for Kona Grill to encourage customers to frequent its restaurants. The loyalty rewards program\nawards a customer one point for every dollar spent. When a customer is part of the rewards program, the obligation to provide future\ndiscounts related to points earned is considered a separate performance obligation, to which a portion of the transaction price is allocated.\nThe performance obligation related to loyalty points is deemed to have been satisfied, and the amount deferred in the balance sheet is\nrecognized as revenue, when the points are converted to a reward and redeemed, or the likelihood of redemption is remote. A portion of the\ntransaction price is allocated to loyalty points, if necessary, on a pro-rata basis, based on the stand-alone selling price, as determined by\nmenu pricing and loyalty points terms. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the deferred revenue allocated to loyalty points that have not\nbeen redeemed was $0.2 million, which is recorded as a component of accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company expects the loyalty points to be redeemed and recognized over a one-year period.\nGift Cards\nProceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when redeemed by the holder. There\nare no expiration dates on the Company’s gift cards and the Company does not charge any service fees that would result in a decrease to a\ncustomer’s available balance.\nAlthough the Company will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, it may determine the likelihood of redemption to be\nremote for certain gift cards due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent the Company\ndetermines there is no requirement for remitting balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, outstanding gift card\nbalances may then be recognized as breakage in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a component of\nowned restaurant net revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.3 million,\nrespectively, in revenue from gift card breakage.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs for Company owned restaurants are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business. Pre-opening\ncosts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $8.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotions as incurred. Advertising expense was $10.4 million and $7.5 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\nContracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a lease at inception. The Company’s contracts determined to be or contain a\nlease include explicitly or implicitly identified assets where the Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits of the\nassets and has the ability to direct how and for what purpose the assets are used during the lease term. If it is determined that the contract\ncontains an operating lease, a right-of-use asset and operating lease liability are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. A right-of-use\nasset represents the Company’s right to use the underlying asset and the lease liability represents the Company’s contractually obligated\npayments. Both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability are recognized as of the commencement date of the lease and are based upon\nthe present value of lease payments due over the course of the lease. The right-of-use asset is reduced by any lease incentives\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nreceived. For leases that do not have a rate implicit in the lease, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of commencement is\nused to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that it would\nhave to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term on an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nThe Company enters into contracts to lease office and restaurant space with terms that expire at various dates through 2047. The lease\nterm is the minimum of the noncancelable period of the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods. The\nCompany considers a number of factors when evaluating whether the options in its lease contracts were reasonably certain of exercise, such\nas length of time before option exercise, expected value of the leased asset at the end of the initial lease term, importance of the lease to\noverall operations, costs to negotiate a new lease, and any contractual or economic penalties.\nCertain of the Company’s leases also provide for percentage rent, which are variable lease costs determined as a percentage of gross\nsales in excess of specified, minimum sales targets, as well as other lease costs to reimburse the lessor for real estate tax and insurance\nexpenses, and certain non-lease components that transfer a distinct service to the Company, such as common area maintenance services.\nThese percentage rents and other variable lease costs are not included in the calculation of lease payments when classifying a lease and in\nthe measurement of the lease liability as they do not meet the definition of in-substance, fixed-lease payments under ASC Topic 842,\nLeases.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company maintains an equity incentive compensation plan under which it may grant options, warrants, restricted stock or other\nstock-based awards to directors, officers, key employees and other key individuals performing services to the Company. Restricted stock\nand restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that vest on the passage of time are valued using the closing stock price on the date of grant. For RSUs\nwith both a market condition and time element, the fair value was calculated using the Monte Carlo Simulation.\nUnder the plan, vesting of awards can either be based on the passage of time or on the achievement of performance goals. For awards\nthat vest on the passage of time, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period. For performance-based awards, the Company\nrecognizes compensation costs over the requisite service period when conditions for achievement become probable. The Company\nestimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ or are expected to\ndiffer. These estimates, which are currently at 10%, are based on historical forfeiture behavior exhibited by employees of the Company.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and income\navailable to common stockholders. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock including common stock issuable pursuant to\nstock options, warrants, and RSUs. Refer to Note 9 for the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company has identified the following four reportable operating segments: STK, Kona Grill, ONE Hospitality and Corporate.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional details and certain financial information regarding the Company’s operating segments relating to the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are\ntranslated at average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiaries represent other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Currency translation gains or losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity and amounted to a loss of approximately $0.1 million and\n$0.2 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s other\ncomprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. All of the Company’s foreign currency translation\nadjustments relate to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB “) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU“) 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This update requires companies to\nmeasure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of\nreasonable and supportable information to estimate credit losses.

Introduction. The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of The One Group Hospitality, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is\nin the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability\nand that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which\nauthorizes the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material\nnoncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the “Policy”).\n2. Administration. This Policy will be administered by the Board or by the Compensation Committee, in which case references\nherein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board will be final\nand binding on all affected individuals.\n3. Covered Executives. This Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the\nBoard, and such other senior leadership team members who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Board (the\n“Covered Executives”). Covered Executives must include the individuals specified in CFR §240.10D-1 and in any national securities\nexchange listing standards (“Listing Standards”) adopted pursuant to such rule that are applicable to the Company.\n4. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement. In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its\nfinancial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,\nirrespective of if or when a financial restatement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Board will\npromptly require reimbursement or forfeiture of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (defined below) received by any Covered\nExecutive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately\nfollowing those three completed fiscal years.\n5. Incentive Compensation. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following; provided that,\nsuch compensation is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure:\n● Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.\n● Stock options.\n● Stock appreciation rights.\n● Restricted stock.\n● Restricted stock units.\n● Performance shares.\n● Performance units.\nFinancial reporting measures include:\n● Company stock price.\n● Total shareholder return.\n● Revenues.\n● Net income.\n● EBITDA.\n● Funds from operations.\n● Liquidity measures such as working capital or operating cash flow.\n● Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets.\n● Earnings measures such as earnings per share.\n6. Erroneously Awarded Compensation. The amount to be recovered (the “Erroneously Awarded Compensation\") will be\nthe excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation\nthat would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, which must be computed without regard\nto any taxes paid, as determined by the Board. If the Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by the Covered Executive is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the accounting restatement, the Board will make its\ndetermination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. If approved by the Board and not prohibited\nby SEC rules or Listing Standards, the Company may cooperate with the Covered Executive in filing any amended tax returns\nrequired as a result of the exercise by the Company of its rights pursuant to this Policy.\n7. Method of Recoupment. The Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation\nhereunder which may include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any\nequity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\n8. No Indemnification. The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly\ncalculated Incentive Compensation or any amount recovered under this Policy.\n9. Interpretation. The Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy.\n10. Effective Date. This Policy will be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and will apply to\nIncentive Compensation that is approved, awarded or granted to Covered Executives before, on or after that date.\n11. Amendment; Termination. The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy\nas it deems necessary to comply with any applicable rules or Listing Standards. The Board may terminate this Policy or adopt a new\npolicy at any time.\n12. Other Recoupment Rights. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar\nagreement entered into shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the\nterms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of\nrecoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity\naward agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\n13. Impracticability. The Company may forego recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation only (a) on conditions\nspecified in applicable SEC rules and Listing Standards and (b) if the Compensation Committee or a majority of independent directors\nserving on the Board determines that recovery would be impractical.\n14. Successors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nAdopted: November 30, 2023"
