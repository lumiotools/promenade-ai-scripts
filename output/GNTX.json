Gentex will also showcase its automotive portfolio of car-to-home automation, connectivity, e-concierge, digital vision, and dimmable glass products for automakers and the automotive aftermarket.\n\nGentex is a long-time supplier of electro-optical products for the global automotive, aerospace, fire protection, and medical industries. It’s best known for supplying nearly every major automaker with connected-car technologies and advanced electronic features that optimize driver vision and enhance safety.\n\n“While we’re primarily a Tier 1 supplier, we maintain an extensive array of products for the aftermarket and OEM accessory programs, which is why we appreciate the SEMA show,” said Gentex Chief Technology Officer Neil Boehm. “We also have a long history in racing, providing custom vision systems for professional racing teams, and extensive prototyping capabilities that have allowed us to contribute to numerous custom vehicle builds over the years.”\n\nGentex’s SEMA booth will host two vehicle unveils from the [Ringbrothers](https://www.ringbrothers.com/), one of the nation’s most prominent custom car builders: INVADR, a 1,246 horsepower, 1987 Buick Grand National, and TUKA, a 1972 Chevy Blazer. Co-founded by brothers Jim and Mike Ring, the Ringbrothers debut celebrated iconic vehicle creations every year at SEMA.\n\n“We’re once again thankful to unveil at the Gentex booth, this year with two exciting vehicle debuts,” said Ringbrothers co-founder Mike Ring. “Gentex and Ringbrothers have partnered on various projects over the past decade, and we appreciate Gentex’s willingness to take its core vision-based products designed for automakers and customize it so it blends seamlessly into our designs.”\n\nIn 2014, Gentex developed its GNTX-R Series of high-performance vision products designed for professional race teams. From that line emerged a limited edition, lightweight, minimalist rearview mirror designed for custom car builds, which debuted on a Ringbrothers vehicle in 2015. The two companies have enjoyed a collaborative relationship ever since.\n\nIn addition to the Ringbrothers unveils, the Gentex booth will feature the debut of Project Opsis, a Chevy Corvette Z06 featuring a meticulous, 35-piece carbon fiber widebody program designed and manufactured by [Label Motorsports](https://www.labelmotorsports.com/), an exotic, European, and custom automotive performance, design, and installation facility located in West Michigan.\n\nThe three vehicle unveils will be hosted by professional emcee, host and presenter Jarod DeAnda, and take place in succession beginning at 1 p.m. on November 5 at the Gentex booth.\n\nGentex’s stand will also highlight connectivity features like [HomeLink](https://www.homelink.com/), the world’s leading car-to-home automation system, and Integrated Toll Module, a universal, vehicle-integrated toll collection technology.\n\nVisitors will also be able to experience the company’s [Full Display Mirror](https://www.fulldisplaymirror.com/), an intelligent rear-vision system that uses a custom, externally mounted camera and mirror-integrated video display to optimize a vehicle’s rearward view. The system captures video from a rearward-facing camera and streams it to a unique mirror-integrated LCD display that provides the driver with an unobstructed panoramic view behind the vehicle. In addition, a version designed specifically for race team use will be highlighted.\n\nGentex’s dimmable sun visor concept will also be on display. The product folds down like a traditional visor but includes a clear, dimmable panel that darkens on demand or in conjunction with sunload sensors.\n\nThe Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show is the world’s premier automotive specialty products trade event. This year’s show takes place November 5-8 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gentex’s display can be seen in Central Hall, Hot Rod Alley, booth 23889.\n\nFounded in 1974, Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ: GNTX) is a supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and electronics to the automotive industry, dimmable aircraft windows for aviation markets, and fire protection products to the fire protection market.

For the third quarter of 2024, global light vehicle production declined by 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. \"During the third quarter of 2024, light vehicle production weakened across all major regions, but especially in our primary markets. When compared to the third quarter of 2023, light vehicle production declined by 6% this quarter in North America, Europe and Japan/Korea, which was significantly worse than the 3% quarter over quarter decline forecasted at the beginning of the quarter,” said Gentex President and CEO, Steve Downing. “The production declines resulted in a sales shortfall of approximately $25 - $30 million for the quarter, but despite that weakness in our end markets, we were able to outperform our primary markets by 12%,” commented Downing.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the gross margin was 33.5%, compared to a gross margin of 33.2% for the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the gross margin improved as a result of the higher revenue levels and purchasing cost reductions, which were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequentially, the gross margin improved by 60 basis points, as a result of the higher sales levels versus the second quarter of 2024 and lower pricing reserves in the third quarter, versus the first half of 2024. \"Overall, we are pleased with the sequential improvement in gross margin, but the third quarter was still behind our margin forecast due to lower than expected sales driven by light vehicle production shortfalls, product mix issues and overhead inefficiencies. We remain committed to our gross margin recovery plan that we laid out over the last 18 months, but given the shifts in the market and light vehicle production mix, we expect that the Company’s margin recovery target won’t be fully achieved until 2025,” said Downing.\n\nOperating expenses during the third quarter of 2024 increased by 13% to $78.3 million, compared to operating expenses of $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses increased quarter over quarter primarily due to staffing and engineering related professional fees. “Our operating expenses remain in line with our expectations for the full year, with increases primarily focused on R&D and launches of new programs and products. Operating expenses, especially R&D expenses, are expected to continue at the current pace for the rest of this year, despite the lower than forecasted light vehicle production and sales levels we have experienced over the last two quarters. Our R&D spend is being driven by several new launches that are currently in development and expected to launch in the next two years, as well as research projects in support of new technologies that we have showcased at CES the last few years,” said Downing.\n\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $125.7 million, compared to income from operations of $122.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther income was $19.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to other income of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change was primarily driven by non-cash gains of $14.5 million resulting from mark-to-market adjustments and other market adjustments of certain holdings within the Company's tech investment portfolio, as well as interest income from the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an effective tax rate of 15.7%, which was primarily driven by the benefit of the foreign derived intangible income deduction.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $122.5 million, a 17% increase compared to net income of $104.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the third quarter was driven by the increased net sales, income from operations, and other income, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.53, an 18% increase compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.45 for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by the increased net sales and operating income as well as the increases in other income for the quarter.\n\nAutomotive net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $596.5 million compared to $564.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Auto-dimming mirror unit shipments decreased by 3% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther net sales in the third quarter of 2024, which includes dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products, were $12.0 million, compared to other net sales of $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Fire protection sales increased by $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Dimmable aircraft window sales decreased by $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded its first official sales of medical devices of $0.8 million from shipments of the previously acquired eSight Go product line and business.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $30.16 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 10.1 million shares remaining available for repurchase pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase plan. The Company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future in support of the previously disclosed capital allocation strategy, but share repurchases will vary from time to time and will take into account macroeconomic issues, market trends, and other factors that the Company deems appropriate.\n\n**Future Estimates**\n\nThe Company’s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full years 2024 and 2025, are based on the mid-October 2024 S&P Global Mobility forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea, and China. Light vehicle production in these markets is expected to decrease by approximately 4% for the fourth quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023, while light vehicle production in our primary markets of North America, Europe and Japan/Korea is expected to be down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For calendar year 2024, light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea and China is now forecasted to decline approximately 2%, compared to light vehicle production in calendar year 2023. Light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 is forecasted to increase by 1%, compared to the calendar year 2024 forecast in these markets. Fourth quarter 2024 and calendar years 2024 and 2025 forecasted vehicle production volumes from S&P Global Mobility are shown below:\n\n**Light Vehicle Production (per S &P Global Mobility mid-October light vehicle production forecast)**  \n---  \n**_(in Millions)_**  \n**Region** | **Q42024** | **Q42023** | **%Change** | **CalendarYear2025** | **CalendarYear2024** | **CalendarYear2023** | **2025 vs2024****%Change** | **2024 vs2023****%Change**  \nNorth America | 3.64 | 3.76 | (3 | )% | 15.29 | 15.47 | 15.68 | (1 | )% | (1 | )%  \nEurope | 4.24 | 4.66 | (9 | )% | 17.00 | 17.07 | 17.97 | — | % | (5 | )%  \nJapan and Korea | 3.20 | 3.38 | (5 | )% | 12.02 | 12.00 | 12.80 | — | % | (6 | )%  \nChina | 8.69 | 8.81 | (1 | )% | 30.02 | 29.34 | 29.04 | 2 | % | 1 | %  \nTotal Light Vehicle Production | 19.77 | 20.61 | (4 | )% | 74.33 | 73.88 | 75.49 | 1 | % | (2 | )%  \n  \nBased on this light vehicle production forecast and actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is making certain changes to its previously provided guidance for calendar year 2024 as shown in the table below.\n\n**2024 Annual Guidance**  \n---  \n**_Guidance as of July 26, 2024_** | **_As of October 25, 2024_**  \nRevenue | $2.40 - $2.50 billion | $2.35 - $2.40 billion  \nGross Margin | 34% - 34.5% | 33.5% - 34.0%  \nOperating Expenses | $295 -$305 million | $295 -$305 million  \nTax Rate | 15% - 16% | 15% - 15.5%  \nCapital Expenditures | $175 - $200 million | $150 - $175 million  \nDepreciation & Amortization | $95 - $100 million | $90 - $95 million  \n  \nAdditionally, based on the Company’s updated forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 as well as year to date actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is updating calendar year 2025 revenue estimates to approximately $2.45 - $2.55 billion.\n\n\"The Company continues to be on pace for record revenue in 2024 and 2025, despite significant changes in the light vehicle production environment, vehicle mix and regional mix that have impacted the production landscape. Obviously, the actual and forecasted light vehicle production deterioration has impacted our total revenue estimates for 2024 and 2025, but our 12% outperformance versus the underlying vehicle production numbers in our primary markets during the third quarter gives us renewed confidence in our ability to continue to outperform the market. While the teams have done a phenomenal job creating and executing our margin recovery plan, industry conditions have created a slower growth environment that we intend to address with increased cost focus, expense control and lower capital expenditures that more closely align with our updated revenue expectations. As we have indicated, the timeline to achieve our targeted gross margin of 35 - 36% will likely push into the 2025 calendar year, but we remain confident in our ability to accomplish our stated goal despite the industry headwinds,” concluded Downing.\n\n**Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For the third quarter of 2024, global light vehicle production declined by 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. \"During the third quarter of 2024, light vehicle production weakened across all major regions, but especially in our primary markets. When compared to the third quarter of 2023, light vehicle production declined by 6% this quarter in North America, Europe and Japan/Korea, which was significantly worse than the 3% quarter over quarter decline forecasted at the beginning of the quarter,” said Gentex President and CEO, Steve Downing. “The production declines resulted in a sales shortfall of approximately $25 - $30 million for the quarter, but despite that weakness in our end markets, we were able to outperform our primary markets by 12%,” commented Downing.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the gross margin was 33.5%, compared to a gross margin of 33.2% for the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the gross margin improved as a result of the higher revenue levels and purchasing cost reductions, which were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequentially, the gross margin improved by 60 basis points, as a result of the higher sales levels versus the second quarter of 2024 and lower pricing reserves in the third quarter, versus the first half of 2024. \"Overall, we are pleased with the sequential improvement in gross margin, but the third quarter was still behind our margin forecast due to lower than expected sales driven by light vehicle production shortfalls, product mix issues and overhead inefficiencies. We remain committed to our gross margin recovery plan that we laid out over the last 18 months, but given the shifts in the market and light vehicle production mix, we expect that the Company’s margin recovery target won’t be fully achieved until 2025,” said Downing.\n\nOperating expenses during the third quarter of 2024 increased by 13% to $78.3 million, compared to operating expenses of $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses increased quarter over quarter primarily due to staffing and engineering related professional fees. “Our operating expenses remain in line with our expectations for the full year, with increases primarily focused on R&D and launches of new programs and products. Operating expenses, especially R&D expenses, are expected to continue at the current pace for the rest of this year, despite the lower than forecasted light vehicle production and sales levels we have experienced over the last two quarters. Our R&D spend is being driven by several new launches that are currently in development and expected to launch in the next two years, as well as research projects in support of new technologies that we have showcased at CES the last few years,” said Downing.\n\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $125.7 million, compared to income from operations of $122.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther income was $19.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to other income of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change was primarily driven by non-cash gains of $14.5 million resulting from mark-to-market adjustments and other market adjustments of certain holdings within the Company's tech investment portfolio, as well as interest income from the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an effective tax rate of 15.7%, which was primarily driven by the benefit of the foreign derived intangible income deduction.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $122.5 million, a 17% increase compared to net income of $104.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the third quarter was driven by the increased net sales, income from operations, and other income, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.53, an 18% increase compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.45 for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by the increased net sales and operating income as well as the increases in other income for the quarter.\n\nAutomotive net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $596.5 million compared to $564.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Auto-dimming mirror unit shipments decreased by 3% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther net sales in the third quarter of 2024, which includes dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products, were $12.0 million, compared to other net sales of $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Fire protection sales increased by $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Dimmable aircraft window sales decreased by $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded its first official sales of medical devices of $0.8 million from shipments of the previously acquired eSight Go product line and business.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $30.16 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 10.1 million shares remaining available for repurchase pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase plan. The Company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future in support of the previously disclosed capital allocation strategy, but share repurchases will vary from time to time and will take into account macroeconomic issues, market trends, and other factors that the Company deems appropriate.\n\n**Future Estimates**\n\nThe Company’s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full years 2024 and 2025, are based on the mid-October 2024 S&P Global Mobility forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea, and China. Light vehicle production in these markets is expected to decrease by approximately 4% for the fourth quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023, while light vehicle production in our primary markets of North America, Europe and Japan/Korea is expected to be down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For calendar year 2024, light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea and China is now forecasted to decline approximately 2%, compared to light vehicle production in calendar year 2023. Light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 is forecasted to increase by 1%, compared to the calendar year 2024 forecast in these markets. Fourth quarter 2024 and calendar years 2024 and 2025 forecasted vehicle production volumes from S&P Global Mobility are shown below:\n\n**Light Vehicle Production (per S &P Global Mobility mid-October light vehicle production forecast)**  \n---  \n**_(in Millions)_**  \n**Region** | **Q42024** | **Q42023** | **%Change** | **CalendarYear2025** | **CalendarYear2024** | **CalendarYear2023** | **2025 vs2024****%Change** | **2024 vs2023****%Change**  \nNorth America | 3.64 | 3.76 | (3 | )% | 15.29 | 15.47 | 15.68 | (1 | )% | (1 | )%  \nEurope | 4.24 | 4.66 | (9 | )% | 17.00 | 17.07 | 17.97 | — | % | (5 | )%  \nJapan and Korea | 3.20 | 3.38 | (5 | )% | 12.02 | 12.00 | 12.80 | — | % | (6 | )%  \nChina | 8.69 | 8.81 | (1 | )% | 30.02 | 29.34 | 29.04 | 2 | % | 1 | %  \nTotal Light Vehicle Production | 19.77 | 20.61 | (4 | )% | 74.33 | 73.88 | 75.49 | 1 | % | (2 | )%  \n  \nBased on this light vehicle production forecast and actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is making certain changes to its previously provided guidance for calendar year 2024 as shown in the table below.\n\n**2024 Annual Guidance**  \n---  \n**_Guidance as of July 26, 2024_** | **_As of October 25, 2024_**  \nRevenue | $2.40 - $2.50 billion | $2.35 - $2.40 billion  \nGross Margin | 34% - 34.5% | 33.5% - 34.0%  \nOperating Expenses | $295 -$305 million | $295 -$305 million  \nTax Rate | 15% - 16% | 15% - 15.5%  \nCapital Expenditures | $175 - $200 million | $150 - $175 million  \nDepreciation & Amortization | $95 - $100 million | $90 - $95 million  \n  \nAdditionally, based on the Company’s updated forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 as well as year to date actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is updating calendar year 2025 revenue estimates to approximately $2.45 - $2.55 billion.\n\n\"The Company continues to be on pace for record revenue in 2024 and 2025, despite significant changes in the light vehicle production environment, vehicle mix and regional mix that have impacted the production landscape. Obviously, the actual and forecasted light vehicle production deterioration has impacted our total revenue estimates for 2024 and 2025, but our 12% outperformance versus the underlying vehicle production numbers in our primary markets during the third quarter gives us renewed confidence in our ability to continue to outperform the market. While the teams have done a phenomenal job creating and executing our margin recovery plan, industry conditions have created a slower growth environment that we intend to address with increased cost focus, expense control and lower capital expenditures that more closely align with our updated revenue expectations. As we have indicated, the timeline to achieve our targeted gross margin of 35 - 36% will likely push into the 2025 calendar year, but we remain confident in our ability to accomplish our stated goal despite the industry headwinds,” concluded Downing.\n\n**Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For the third quarter of 2024, global light vehicle production declined by 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. \"During the third quarter of 2024, light vehicle production weakened across all major regions, but especially in our primary markets. When compared to the third quarter of 2023, light vehicle production declined by 6% this quarter in North America, Europe and Japan/Korea, which was significantly worse than the 3% quarter over quarter decline forecasted at the beginning of the quarter,” said Gentex President and CEO, Steve Downing. “The production declines resulted in a sales shortfall of approximately $25 - $30 million for the quarter, but despite that weakness in our end markets, we were able to outperform our primary markets by 12%,” commented Downing.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the gross margin was 33.5%, compared to a gross margin of 33.2% for the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the gross margin improved as a result of the higher revenue levels and purchasing cost reductions, which were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequentially, the gross margin improved by 60 basis points, as a result of the higher sales levels versus the second quarter of 2024 and lower pricing reserves in the third quarter, versus the first half of 2024. \"Overall, we are pleased with the sequential improvement in gross margin, but the third quarter was still behind our margin forecast due to lower than expected sales driven by light vehicle production shortfalls, product mix issues and overhead inefficiencies. We remain committed to our gross margin recovery plan that we laid out over the last 18 months, but given the shifts in the market and light vehicle production mix, we expect that the Company’s margin recovery target won’t be fully achieved until 2025,” said Downing.\n\nOperating expenses during the third quarter of 2024 increased by 13% to $78.3 million, compared to operating expenses of $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses increased quarter over quarter primarily due to staffing and engineering related professional fees. “Our operating expenses remain in line with our expectations for the full year, with increases primarily focused on R&D and launches of new programs and products. Operating expenses, especially R&D expenses, are expected to continue at the current pace for the rest of this year, despite the lower than forecasted light vehicle production and sales levels we have experienced over the last two quarters. Our R&D spend is being driven by several new launches that are currently in development and expected to launch in the next two years, as well as research projects in support of new technologies that we have showcased at CES the last few years,” said Downing.\n\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $125.7 million, compared to income from operations of $122.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther income was $19.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to other income of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change was primarily driven by non-cash gains of $14.5 million resulting from mark-to-market adjustments and other market adjustments of certain holdings within the Company's tech investment portfolio, as well as interest income from the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an effective tax rate of 15.7%, which was primarily driven by the benefit of the foreign derived intangible income deduction.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $122.5 million, a 17% increase compared to net income of $104.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the third quarter was driven by the increased net sales, income from operations, and other income, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.53, an 18% increase compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.45 for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by the increased net sales and operating income as well as the increases in other income for the quarter.\n\nAutomotive net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $596.5 million compared to $564.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Auto-dimming mirror unit shipments decreased by 3% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther net sales in the third quarter of 2024, which includes dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products, were $12.0 million, compared to other net sales of $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Fire protection sales increased by $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Dimmable aircraft window sales decreased by $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded its first official sales of medical devices of $0.8 million from shipments of the previously acquired eSight Go product line and business.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $30.16 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 10.1 million shares remaining available for repurchase pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase plan. The Company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future in support of the previously disclosed capital allocation strategy, but share repurchases will vary from time to time and will take into account macroeconomic issues, market trends, and other factors that the Company deems appropriate.\n\n**Future Estimates**\n\nThe Company’s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full years 2024 and 2025, are based on the mid-October 2024 S&P Global Mobility forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea, and China. Light vehicle production in these markets is expected to decrease by approximately 4% for the fourth quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023, while light vehicle production in our primary markets of North America, Europe and Japan/Korea is expected to be down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For calendar year 2024, light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea and China is now forecasted to decline approximately 2%, compared to light vehicle production in calendar year 2023. Light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 is forecasted to increase by 1%, compared to the calendar year 2024 forecast in these markets. Fourth quarter 2024 and calendar years 2024 and 2025 forecasted vehicle production volumes from S&P Global Mobility are shown below:\n\n**Light Vehicle Production (per S &P Global Mobility mid-October light vehicle production forecast)**  \n---  \n**_(in Millions)_**  \n**Region** | **Q42024** | **Q42023** | **%Change** | **CalendarYear2025** | **CalendarYear2024** | **CalendarYear2023** | **2025 vs2024****%Change** | **2024 vs2023****%Change**  \nNorth America | 3.64 | 3.76 | (3 | )% | 15.29 | 15.47 | 15.68 | (1 | )% | (1 | )%  \nEurope | 4.24 | 4.66 | (9 | )% | 17.00 | 17.07 | 17.97 | — | % | (5 | )%  \nJapan and Korea | 3.20 | 3.38 | (5 | )% | 12.02 | 12.00 | 12.80 | — | % | (6 | )%  \nChina | 8.69 | 8.81 | (1 | )% | 30.02 | 29.34 | 29.04 | 2 | % | 1 | %  \nTotal Light Vehicle Production | 19.77 | 20.61 | (4 | )% | 74.33 | 73.88 | 75.49 | 1 | % | (2 | )%  \n  \nBased on this light vehicle production forecast and actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is making certain changes to its previously provided guidance for calendar year 2024 as shown in the table below.\n\n**2024 Annual Guidance**  \n---  \n**_Guidance as of July 26, 2024_** | **_As of October 25, 2024_**  \nRevenue | $2.40 - $2.50 billion | $2.35 - $2.40 billion  \nGross Margin | 34% - 34.5% | 33.5% - 34.0%  \nOperating Expenses | $295 -$305 million | $295 -$305 million  \nTax Rate | 15% - 16% | 15% - 15.5%  \nCapital Expenditures | $175 - $200 million | $150 - $175 million  \nDepreciation & Amortization | $95 - $100 million | $90 - $95 million  \n  \nAdditionally, based on the Company’s updated forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2025 as well as year to date actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company is updating calendar year 2025 revenue estimates to approximately $2.45 - $2.55 billion.\n\n\"The Company continues to be on pace for record revenue in 2024 and 2025, despite significant changes in the light vehicle production environment, vehicle mix and regional mix that have impacted the production landscape. Obviously, the actual and forecasted light vehicle production deterioration has impacted our total revenue estimates for 2024 and 2025, but our 12% outperformance versus the underlying vehicle production numbers in our primary markets during the third quarter gives us renewed confidence in our ability to continue to outperform the market. While the teams have done a phenomenal job creating and executing our margin recovery plan, industry conditions have created a slower growth environment that we intend to address with increased cost focus, expense control and lower capital expenditures that more closely align with our updated revenue expectations. As we have indicated, the timeline to achieve our targeted gross margin of 35 - 36% will likely push into the 2025 calendar year, but we remain confident in our ability to accomplish our stated goal despite the industry headwinds,” concluded Downing.\n\n**Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
