Read the\nprospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before investing.\nThere are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform\nvalue stocks or the overall equity market. Growth stocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types ofstocks. Funds focusing their\ninvestments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater\nshare price volatility. The Fund is non-diversified, as a result, changes in the market value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value of Fund\nshares than would occur in a diversified fund. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit. The\nFund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets and the Index may not perform as intended. The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger capitalization stocks\nor the stock market as a whole. Small-capitalization companies may be particularly sensitive to adverse economic developments aswell as changes in interest\nrates, government regulation, borrowing costs and earnings. The Fund is new and has limited operating history.

The performance impact of these deviations is especially magnified in the more inefficient\nmid- and small-cap universes. Take the returns of the S&P and Russell family of indexes as an example.\nThe black line of the large-cap indexes hovers closest to a 0% return difference, with the mid- and small-\ncap indexes having return differences of over 8% in certain rolling 3-year periods.\nSource: WisdomTree, S&P, Russell, 4/30/94-9/30/2024. Rolling 3-Year return differentials are annualized. Large-Caps measured by S&P 500 and\nRussell 1000. Mid-Caps measured by S&P 400 and Russell Midcap. Small-Caps measured by S&P 600 and Russell 2000. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results. You cannot invest directly in an index.\nA major driver in relative performance is the weight that unprofitable companies—which are generally\nexcluded from the S&P Indexes—account for in each universe. In large-cap indexes, there are very few\nunprofitable companies.\nIn mid- and small-cap indexes, particularly small-cap growth indexes, unprofitable companies can\nmake up over one-fourth of the weight of the index, and over 40% of the company count.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nQMID/QS ML WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Fund/WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Fund 2\nSource: WisdomTree, FactSet, as of 9/30/2024. You cannot invest directly in an index.\nThe natural question is, “what are these unprofitable companies?” In general, they are in the Health\nCare and Information Technology sectors; almost 75% of mid- and small-cap Health Care and 55% of\nInfo. Tech. companies are unprofitable. Screening for quality (profitability) in a growth universe, by\ndesign, results in under-weights to these unprofitable companies.\nSource: WisdomTree, FactSet, as of 9/30/2024. You cannot invest directly in an index.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nQMID/QS ML WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Fund/WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Fund 3\nWhy Quality for Mid- and Small-Caps\nInvestors are familiar with the standard value, blend, and growth styles. Higher operating profitability\n(higher quality) has outpaced lower quality over time. And that outperformance has been most\npronounced in the higher growth (less value) segments of the market. Among investors who allocate to\nQuality, many often think Large-Cap when they think of Quality. High-profitability small-caps have\noutperformed high-profitability large-caps over the long-run. The performance spread between high-\nprofitability and low-profitability companies is even greater within small-caps than large-caps.\nSource: Kenneth French Data Library, 6/30/1963-8/31/2024. Period based on availability of annual operating profitability returns, which begins\n6/30/1963. Portfolios are market capitalization weighted. Market is U.S.-listed equities grouped on the basis of operating profitability and\nmarket capitalization. The portfolios, which are constructed at the end of each June, are the intersections of 2 portfolios formed on size\n(market equity, ME) and 3 portfolios formed on profitability (OP). The size breakpoint for year t is the median NYSE market equity at the end\nof June of year t. OP for June of year t is annual revenues minus cost of goods sold, interest expense, and selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses divided by book equity for the last fiscal year end in t-1. The OP breakpoints are the 30th and 70th NYSE percentiles. For simplicity,\nonly 4 of the 6 portfolios are shown in this graph. “Small High Profitability” portfolio is the intersection of securities with below median market\ncapitalization and in the top 30% on operating profitability. “Small Low Profitability” portfolio is the intersection of securities with below\nmedian market capitalization and in the bottom 30% on operating profitability. “Large High Profitability” portfolio is the intersection of\nsecurities with above median market capitalization and in the top 30% on operating profitability. “Large Low Profitability” portfolio is the\nintersection of securities with above median market capitalization and in the bottom 30% on operating profitability. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results.\nHow do you Identify Growth Stocks?\nA few common measures to identify growth stocks include trailing sales and earnings growth, future\nsales and earnings growth estimates, and relative valuations like price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and\nprice-to-book ratios.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nPSSDLLD o r tfo liom\na ll H ig h P ro fita b ilitym\na ll L o w P ro fita b ilityiffe\nr e n c ea\nrg e H ig h P ro fita b ilitya\nrg e L o w P ro fita b ilityiffe\nr e n c e\nA n n u a liz e d R1\n4 .0 0 %9\n.4 1 %4\n.5 9 %1\n1 .9 5 %8\n.0 6 %3\n.9 0 %\ne tu r n s\nQMID/QS ML WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Fund/WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Fund 4\nBecause earnings-based measures of growth may be undefined for loss-making growth companies,\ngrowth strategies may ignore profitability considerations in favor of metrics like price-to-sales and\nprice-to-book as proxies for growth.\nAt times, growth investors become enamored with more narrow non-earnings growth measures like\n“eye-balls” during the internet craze of the early 2000s or “subscriber-growth” in recent years as it\nrelates to streaming platforms and social media companies.\nThis can lead to an approach to growth that over-weights highly speculative, or junky, growth names.\nAlternatively, some investors have been considering focusing on quality stocks—companies with higher\nprofitability—to implicitly tilt towards profitable growth stocks. But ignoring explicit growth signals can\nlead to excluding some of the fastest growing companies, diluting the intended growth exposure.\nThe WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth and WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Indexes\naim to identify stocks that have both quality and growth characteristics to avoid having to make\nsacrifices on either factor.\nWisdomTree U.S. MidCap and SmallCap Quality Growth Indexes\nThe WisdomTree U.S. MidCap and SmallCap Quality Growth Indexes are market-cap weighted indexes\nthat consist of companies with quality and growth characteristics. Mid- and small-cap U.S. companies\nare ranked on a composite score of two fundamental factors: growth and quality, which are equally\nweighted.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nQMID/QS ML WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Fund/WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Fund 5\nThe Index is comprised of the top 30% of companies with the highest composite scores.\nInvestment Process\nYou cannot invest directly in an index.\nIndex Characteristics\nReal Estate, Utilities, and Banks are excluded from the Indexes because companies from these sectors\ntend to have lower earnings growth and/or high earnings volatility (lowering earnings quality).\nThe low growth of these sectors can be seen from the relative under-weight of the Russell Growth\nindexes on these sectors relative to the broad Russell Indexes.\nCompared to the Russell Midcap Growth Index, the WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Index is\noverweight in sectors not traditionally associated with growth, such as Consumer Staples, Energy, and\nIndustrials. The Index is underweight Health Care and Information Technology; two sectors commonly\nassociated with growth investing.\nA similar pattern of over- and under-weights can be seen in the small-cap Indexes, with an even greater\ndifference in Health Care, to which the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Index is underweight\ncompared to even the broad Russell 2000 Index.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nQMID/QS ML WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Quality Growth Fund/WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Growth Fund 6\nBy screening for quality in addition to growth, the WisdomTree U.S. MidCap and SmallCap Quality\nGrowth Indexes gain exposure to fast-growing companies with high quality scores, while filtering out\nhighly speculative names with weaker profitability measures.\nIndex Sector Weights\nSource: WisdomTree, FactSet, as of 9/30/2024.

For a prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus containing this and other\nimportant information about the fund, call 866.909.9473 or visit WisdomTree.com/investments. Read the\nprospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before investing.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nThere are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.\nQMID: Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform value stocks or the overall\nequity market. Growth stocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types of stocks. The Fund is\nnon-diversified, as a result, changes in the market value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value\nof Fund shares than would occur in a diversified fund. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of,\nits Index regardless of their investment merit. The Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive\npositions in declining markets and the Index may not perform as intended. The fund invests primarily in the securities of\nmid-capitalization companies. As a result, the Fund's performance may be adversely affected if securities of these\ncompanies underperform securities of other capitalization ranges or the market as a whole. Securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies are often less stable and more vulnerable to market volatility and adverse economic\ndevelopments than securities of larger companies, but mid-capitalization companies may also underperform the\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies because medium capitalization companies are more mature and are subject\nto slower growth during economic expansion. The Fund is new and has limited operating history.\nQSML: Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform value stocks or the overall\nequity market. Growth stocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types of stocks. Funds\nfocusing their investments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single\neconomic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The Fund is non-diversified, as a\nresult, changes in the market value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value of Fund shares than\nwould occur in a diversified fund. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless\nof their investment merit. The Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining\nmarkets and the Index may not perform as intended. The securities of small-capitalization companies generally trade in\nlower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger capitalization stocks or the\nstock market as a whole. Small-capitalization companies may be particularly sensitive to adverse economic\ndevelopments as well as changes in interest rates, government regulation, borrowing costs and earnings. The Fund is\nnew and has limited operating history.\nPlease read each Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each Fund’s risk profile.\nWisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. “WisdomTree” is a registered mark of WisdomTree, Inc.\nWisdomTree.com/investments"

Size (SMB) refers to small-minus-big and is the sensitivity or factor loading to small caps, with higher numbers\nindicating greater loading to small caps. Value (HML) refers to high-minus-low and is the sensitivity or factor loading to value, specifically the book value-to-market value ratio, with higher meaning more loading\ntoward value. Quality (RMW) refers to robust-minus-weak and is the sensitivity or factor loading to operating profitability. Investment (CMA) premium associated with investing in companies that grow assets\nconservatively vs. those that grow them aggressively; a higher loading suggests a positive sensitivity with this premium, while a negative loading suggests the opposite.\nSee the important information on page 30 regarding PIP Data.
