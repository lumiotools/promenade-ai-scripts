(the Ansys\nMerger); strategies related to our products, technology and services; business and market outlook, opportunities, strategies and technological trends, such as artificial intelligence;\nthe Ansys Merger, including, among other things, its anticipated benefits; planned dispositions and their expected impact, such as the previously announced divestiture of our\nSoftware Integrity business (the Software Integrity Divestiture); the potential impact of the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment on our financial results; the\nexpected impact of U.S. and foreign government actions and regulatory changes, including export control restrictions, on our financial results; customer demand and market\nexpansion; our planned product releases and capabilities; industry growth rates; the expected realization of our contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance\nobligations (backlog); software trends; planned stock repurchases; our expected tax rate; and the impact and result of pending legal, administrative and tax proceedings. These\nstatements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, time frames or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such\nforward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and factors include, but are not limited to: macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical uncertainty in the global economy;\nuncertainty in the growth of the semiconductor and electronics industries; the highly competitive industry we operate in; actions by the U.S. or foreign governments, such as the\nimposition of additional export restrictions or tariffs; consolidation among our customers and our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers; risks and compliance\nobligations relating to the global nature of our operations; failure to complete the Ansys Merger on the terms described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the SEC), if at all; failure to obtain required governmental approvals related to the Ansys Merger or the imposition of conditions to such governmental approvals that may have an\nadverse effect on us; failure to realize the benefits expected from the Ansys Merger; failure to complete the Software Integrity Divestiture, or the Software Integrity Divestiture\ndisrupting our business or failing to achieve its intended benefits, and more. Additional information on potential risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect Synopsys’\nresults is included in filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including in the sections entitled “Risk Factors\" in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our latest\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial information contained in this presentation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in Synopsys’ most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, each as may be amended from time to time. Synopsys’ financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2024\nare not necessarily indicative of Synopsys’ operating results for any future periods. The information provided herein is as of August 21, 2024. Synopsys undertakes no duty to, and\ndoes not intend to, update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nRegulation G\nIn addition to financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), this presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nWhen possible, Synopsys provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely applicable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of certain of the non-\nGAAP financial measures (either contained in this presentation or given verbally) to their most comparable GAAP measures are included in the table at the end of this presentation,\nalong with the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings release and financial supplement, dated August 21, 2024, and available on Synopsys’ website at\nhttps://investor.synopsys.com/overview/default.aspx. Synopsys is unable to provide a reconciliation of its long-term, multi-year target for annual non-GAAP EPS growth and certain\nfourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP financial targets to the corresponding GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because Synopsys believes that it\nwould not be possible for it to have the required information necessary to quantitatively reconcile such measures with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts due to, among\nother things, the potential variability and limited predictability of the excluded adjustment items necessary for a full reconciliation such as certain acquisition/divestiture related items,\nrestructuring charges, tax deduction variability, changes in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan, and gains (losses) on the sale of strategic investments. For\nthe same reasons, Synopsys is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

In evaluating our business segments, the CODM considers the income and expenses that the CODM believes are directly related to those segments. The CODM does not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our business segments and, as a result, the reported operating income and operating margin do not include these unallocated expenses as shown in the table below. These unallocated expenses are presented in the table below to provide a reconciliation of the total adjusted operating income from segments to our consolidated operating income from continuing operations:\n\n**SYNOPSYS, INC.**  \n---  \n**Business Segment Reporting(1)(2)(5)**  \n_(in millions)_  \n**Three Months Ended July 31, 2024** | **Three Months Ended July 31, 2023** | **Nine Months EndedJuly 31, 2024** | **Nine Months EndedJuly 31, 2023**  \nRevenue by segment  \n- Design Automation | $ 1,062.6 | $ 1,004.2 | $ 3,103.0 | $ 2,821.5  \n_% of Total_ | 69.6 % | 74.1 % | 69.1 % | 73.3 %  \n- Design IP | $ 463.1 | $ 350.2 | $ 1,388.5 | $ 1,029.1  \n_% of Total_ | 30.4 % | 25.9 % | 30.9 % | 26.7 %  \nAdjusted operating income by segment  \n- Design Automation | $ 440.9 | $ 410.0 | $ 1,218.6 | $ 1,102.8  \n- Design IP | $ 169.7 | $ 82.8 | $ 540.2 | $ 277.7  \nAdjusted operating margin by segment  \n- Design Automation | 41.5 % | 40.8 % | 39.3 % | 39.1 %  \n- Design IP | 36.7 % | 23.6 % | 38.9 % | 27.0 %  \n  \n**Total Adjusted Segment Operating Income Reconciliation(1)(2)(5)**  \n---  \n_(in millions)_  \n**Three Months Ended July 31, 2024** | **Three Months Ended July 31, 2023** | **Nine Months EndedJuly 31, 2024** | **Nine Months EndedJuly 31, 2023**  \nGAAP total operating income – as reported | $ 360.2 | $ 300.1 | $ 1,044.9 | $ 849.1  \nOther expenses managed at consolidated level  \n-Amortization of acquired intangible assets (3) | 18.6 | 13.0 | 53.3 | 38.6  \n-Stock-based compensation (3) | 164.4 | 131.5 | 492.6 | 384.5  \n-Non-qualified deferred compensation plan | 25.8 | 21.5 | 76.3 | 44.1  \n-Acquisition/divestiture related items (4) | 41.7 | 4.8 | 91.8 | 9.8  \n-Restructuring charges | — | 21.9 | — | 54.4  \nTotal adjusted segment operating income | $ 610.6 | $ 492.8 | $ 1,758.8 | $ 1,380.5  \n(1) Synopsys manages the business on a long-term, annual basis, and considers quarterly fluctuations of revenue and profitability as normal elements of our business. Amounts may not foot due to rounding.  \n(2) Synopsys' third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and 2023 ended on August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. For presentation purposes, we refer tothe closest calendar month end. The first quarter of fiscal year 2024 included one extra week.  \n(3) The adjustment includes non-GAAP expenses attributable to non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest.  \n(4) The adjustment excludes the amortization of bridge financing costs entered into in connection with the pending acquisition of Ansys, that was recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.  \n(5) Presented on a continuing operations basis.  \n  \n**GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation** Synopsys continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP but acknowledges evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Synopsys presents non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Synopsys' operating results in a manner that focuses on what Synopsys believes to be its core business operations and what Synopsys uses to evaluate its business operations and for internal budgeting and resource allocation purposes. This press release includes non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP tax rate for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for non-GAAP expenses, non-GAAP interest and other income (expense), non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nWhen possible, Synopsys provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely applicable GAAP financial measures. Synopsys is unable to provide a full reconciliation of certain fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP financial targets to the corresponding GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because Synopsys believes that it would not be possible for it to have the required information necessary to quantitatively reconcile such measures with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts due to, among other things, the potential variability and limited predictability of the excluded adjustment items necessary for a full reconciliation such as certain acquisition/divestiture related items, restructuring charges, tax deduction variability, changes in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan, and gains (losses) on the sale of strategic investments. For the same reasons, Synopsys is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. \n\nSynopsys' management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, as superior to, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Synopsys' management believes presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides useful information to investors allowing them to view financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations through the eyes of management. Synopsys' management evaluates and makes decisions about our business operations using both GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate internal comparisons to Synopsys' historical operating results and forecasted targets, planning and forecasting in subsequent periods and comparisons to competitors' operating results.\n\nThe following are descriptions of the adjustments made to reconcile non-GAAP financial measures (other than free cash flow, which is defined in the footnote to the _Financial Targets_ table above) to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\n\n(i) _Amortization of acquired intangible assets._ We incur expenses from amortization of acquired intangible assets, which include, among other things, core/developed technology, customer relationships, contract rights, trademarks and trade names, and other intangibles related to acquisitions. We amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We do not enter into acquisitions on a predictable cycle. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and their estimated useful lives can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition. We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the amortization of intangible assets provides investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. We also exclude this item because such expenses are non-cash in nature and we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operational performance and liquidity, and ability to invest in research and development and fund future acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n(ii) _Stock-based compensation_. Stock-based compensation expenses consist primarily of expenses related to restricted stock units, stock options, employee stock purchase rights and other stock awards, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us. Further, the expense for the fair value of the stock-based instruments we utilize may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards and, therefore, is not used by management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.\n\n(iii) _Acquisition/divestiture related items._ In connection with certain of our business combinations and/or divestitures, we incur significant expenses that we would not have otherwise incurred as part of our business operations. These expenses include, among other things, compensation expenses, professional fees and other direct expenses, concurrent restructuring activities and divestiture activities, including employee severance and other exit costs, bridge financing costs, costs related to integration activities, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquired company, and amortization of the fair value difference of below-market value assets arising from arrangements entered into or acquired in conjunction with an acquisition. We also recognize the gains and losses from the mark-up of equity or cost method investments to fair value upon obtaining control through acquisition. We exclude these items because they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the core operation of our business. Further, because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction, we believe it is useful to exclude such expenses when looking for a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods.\n\n(iv) _Restructuring charges._ We initiate restructuring activities to align our costs to our operating plans and business strategies based on then-current economic conditions, and such activities have a specific and defined term. Restructuring costs generally include severance and other termination benefits related to voluntary retirement programs, involuntary headcount reductions and facilities closures. Such restructuring costs include elimination of operational redundancy, permanent reductions in workforce and facilities closures and, therefore, are not considered by us to be a part of the core operation of our business and are not used by management when assessing the core profitability and performance of our business operations.\n\n(v) _Gains (losses) on the sale of strategic investments._ We exclude gains and losses on the sale of equity investments in privately held companies because we do not believe they are reflective of our core business and operating results.\n\n(vi) _Deferred compensation_. We exclude changes in the fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan because we do not use these to assess the core profitability of our business operations.\n\n(vii) _Income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments_. Excluding the income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effect on net income. We utilize an annual non-GAAP tax rate in calculating non-GAAP financial measures to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of certain non-recurring and other period-specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and do not necessarily reflect our normal operations, and to more closely align our tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. This annual non-GAAP tax rate is based on an evaluation of our historical and projected mix of U.S. and international profit before tax, taking into account the impact of non-GAAP adjustments, U.S. tax law changes, as well as other factors such as our current tax structure, existing tax positions and expected recurring tax incentives. Based on these considerations, we have elected to adopt a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% for fiscal year 2024.\n\n**INVESTOR CONTACT** :Trey CampbellSynopsys, Inc.650-584-4289Synopsys-ir@synopsys.com\n\n**EDITORIAL CONTACT** :Cara WalkerSynopsys, Inc.650-584-5000corp-pr@synopsys.com\n\n[ ![Synopsys \\(PRNewsfoto/Synopsys\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2186690/Synopsys_Logo_Purple.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2186690/Synopsys_Logo_Purple.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF88214&sd=2024-08-21) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/synopsys-posts-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-302227772.html>\n\nSOURCE Synopsys, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/default.aspx)\n"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation\nWe have prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Pursuant to these rules and regulations, we have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote\ndisclosures we normally include in our annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (U.S. GAAP). The condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited but, in management’s opinion, we have made all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, except as otherwise indicated) necessary for a fair presentation of our quarterly\nresults. Our interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the\nfull fiscal year. These financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nnotes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on December 12, 2023 (our\nAnnual Report).\nUse of Estimates. To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates and could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and\nmajority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFiscal Year and Fiscal Quarter End. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception\nthat approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to\nrealign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week year ending on November 2, 2024, which impacts our revenue, expenses\nand operating results. Fiscal 2023 was a 52-week year and ended on October 28, 2023.\nOur results of operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 included 40 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively, and ended on August\n3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. For presentation purposes, the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\nrefer to the closest calendar month end.\n8\nSoftware Integrity Divestiture. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we determined that our Software Integrity business met the criteria to\nbe classified as a discontinued operation, and, as a result, Software Integrity’s historical financial results are reflected in our consolidated\nfinancial statements as discontinued operations, and assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale.\nWe did not allocate any general corporate overhead to discontinued operations. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies included in our Annual Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement\n(Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which applies to all equity securities\nmeasured at fair value that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. This change prohibits entities from taking into account contractual\nrestrictions on the sale of equity securities when estimating fair value and introduces required disclosures for such transactions. The ASU will\nbecome effective for us beginning on November 1, 2024 and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. Any future impact from\nthe adoption of this ASU will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The\nASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the\nChief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its\ncomposition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The ASU is effective for our\nannual report beginning in the fiscal year 2025, and interim period reports beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2026 on a retrospective\nbasis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid\ninformation. The ASU will become effective for us beginning on November 1, 2025 and will be applied on a prospective basis, with a\nretrospective option. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements\nand related disclosures.\nNote 3. Discontinued Operations\nOn May 5, 2024, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) by and between Synopsys and Sapphire Software\nBuyer, Inc. (Buyer), an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and Francisco Partners (together, the Sponsors),\npursuant to which we will sell our Software Integrity business. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of\ncustomary closing conditions specified therein, we will sell our Software Integrity business to the Buyer (the Software Integrity Divestiture) for a\npurchase price of up to $2.1 billion in cash, comprised of: (i) $1.5 billion, payable at closing; (ii) $125 million, payable in equal installments over\nfive fiscal quarters beginning on the first business day after the 75th day of our first full fiscal quarter following the closing, subject to acceleration\nat our option prior to the closing of our pending acquisition of ANSYS, Inc. (Ansys); and (iii) up to $475 million, payable upon the Sponsors\nachieving a specified rate of return in the event of one or more potential liquidity transactions.\nThe Software Integrity Divestiture, which was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, is currently expected to close in the second half\nof 2024, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\n9\nManagement believes that the Software Integrity Divestiture has met the criteria to be disclosed as discontinued operations as it represents a\nsignificant strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of the Software Integrity business are\npresented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of income and, as such, have been excluded from both\ncontinuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Further, we reclassified the assets and liabilities of the Software Integrity\nbusiness as assets and liabilities held for sale in the condensed consolidated statements of balance sheets for all periods presented. The\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued\noperations. We did not allocate any general corporate overhead to the Software Integrity business. Unless otherwise noted, reference within\nthese Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relates to continuing operations.\nThe financial results of the Software Integrity business are presented as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on our\ncondensed consolidated statements of income. The following table presents the major components of financial results of our Software Integrity\nbusiness for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 127,917 $ 132,898 $ 392,579 $ 392,860\nCost of revenue 40,279 47,050 136,010 145,188\nOperating expenses 91,854 90,450 262,745 258,008\nInterest and other income (expense), net 605 324 1,601 722\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations before\nincome taxes (3,611) (4,278) (4,575) (9,614)\nIncome tax provisions (benefits) 14,202 (4,822) 8,580 (9,318)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of\nincome taxes $ (17,813) $ 544 $ (13,155) $ (296)\nAs of July 31, 2024, the assets and liabilities of our Software Integrity business are classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance\nsheets, as it is probable that the sale will occur within one year.

Pending Acquisition of Ansys\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of\nAnsys, a provider of broad engineering simulation and analysis software and services, in a cash-and-stock transaction (the Ansys Merger) that\nvalues Ansys at approximately $35.0 billion, based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 2023.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Ansys Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Ansys common stock\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (with certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into\nthe right to receive 0.3450 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of Synopsys common stock and $197.00 in cash, without interest. The Merger\nAgreement also provides for Synopsys’ assumption of certain outstanding Ansys options and other unvested Ansys equity awards held by\ncontinuing Ansys\n11\nemployees. If the stock consideration to be issued by Synopsys in connection with the Ansys Merger exceeds 19.9999% of the shares of\nSynopsys common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum\nextent necessary to ensure that the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Ansys Merger\ndoes not exceed such threshold, and the cash consideration will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.\nThe Ansys Merger was approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ansys common stock on May 22, 2024 and is\nanticipated to close in the first half of calendar year 2025. The Ansys Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing\nconditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as\namended, the clearance of the Ansys Merger under certain other antitrust and foreign investment regimes, and the continued effectiveness of\nthe registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-277912) filed by us on March 14, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on April 17, 2024.\nWe and Ansys each have termination rights under the Merger Agreement. A fee of $1.5 billion may be payable by us to Ansys, or a fee of\n$950.0 million may be payable by Ansys to us, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, each as more fully\ndescribed in the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on January 15, 2024 (the Bridge Commitment\nLetter) with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, a senior unsecured\nbridge facility (the Bridge Commitment). The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $11.7 billion. On\nFebruary 13, 2024, we entered into a term loan facility credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement), which provides us with the ability to borrow\nup to $4.3 billion at the closing of the Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for similar facilities, for the\npurpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with\nthe Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See Note 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and\nRevolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Bridge Commitment and\nthe Term Loan Agreement.\nNote 5. Business Combinations\nDuring the nine months ended July 31, 2024, we completed three acquisitions for aggregate purchase consideration of $159.3 million, net of\ncash acquired. The purchase consideration was allocated as follows: $78.9 million to identifiable intangible assets, $97.5 million to goodwill, and\n$17.1 million to net tangible liabilities. The total purchase consideration is preliminary, and as additional information becomes available, we may\nfurther revise it during the remainder of the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the closing of the acquisition. The\ngoodwill recognized from these acquisitions, of which $62.7 million was attributable to the Design Automation reporting unit and $34.8 million\nwas attributable to the Design IP reporting unit, was not deductible for income tax purposes.\nWe have included the financial results of these acquisitions in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of each\nacquisition. These results were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nTransaction costs were $53.0 million and $110.2 million during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, respectively. Transaction costs\nwere $4.8 million and $9.8 million during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. These costs mainly consisted of\nprofessional fees and administrative costs for closed and pending acquisitions and were expensed as incurred in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of income.\nNote 6. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue\n12\nThe following table shows the percentage of revenue by product groups:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEDA 66.9 % 71.8 % 66.8 % 71.3 %\nDesign IP 30.4 % 25.9 % 30.9 % 26.7 %\nOther 2.7 % 2.3 % 2.3 % 2.0 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nContract Balances\nThe contract assets indicated below are presented as prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The\ncontract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to invoice and receive payment become unconditional. Unbilled receivables are\npresented as accounts receivable, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract balances are as follows:\nAs of\nJuly 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nContract assets, net $ 693,874 $ 375,904\nUnbilled receivables $ 33,603 $ 60,016\nDeferred revenue $ 1,675,884 $ 1,710,288\nDuring the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, we recognized revenue of $216.8 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, that was included\nin the deferred revenue balance as of October 31, 2023, including previously unfulfilled contracts that have expired and are no longer subject to\nan implied promise to provide future services.\nContracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations (backlog) were approximately $7.9 billion as of July 31, 2024, which\nincludes $1.2 billion in non-cancellable Flexible Spending Account (FSA) commitments from customers where actual product selection and\nquantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. We have elected to exclude future sales-based\nroyalty payments from the remaining performance obligations. Approximately 40% of the backlog as of July 31, 2024, excluding non-cancellable\nFSA, is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The majority of the remaining\nbacklog is expected to be recognized in the following three years.\nDuring the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, we recognized $21.1 million and $73.9 million, respectively, from performance\nobligations satisfied from sales-based royalties earned during the periods. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, we\nrecognized $24.2 million and $75.8 million, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied from sales-based royalties earned during the\nperiods.\nCosts of Obtaining a Contract with Customer\nCapitalized commission costs, net of accumulated amortization, as of July 31, 2024 were $70.5 million and are included in other long-term\nassets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of these assets was $12.6 million and $36.3 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended July 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in our condensed consolidated statements of\nincome. Amortization of these assets was $14.0 million and $40.3 million during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, respectively,\nand are included in sales and marketing expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nNote 7.

Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on fair values.\nRestricted cash. We include amounts generally described as restricted cash in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period\nand end-of-period total amounts shown on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Restricted cash is primarily associated with\noffice leases and employee loan programs.\n16\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nAs of\nJuly 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,839,815 $ 1,433,966\nRestricted cash included in prepaid and other current assets 1,536 1,549\nRestricted cash included in other long-term assets 694 725\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,842,045 $ 1,436,240\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash from discontinued operations 17,441 4,947\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, including cash from discontinued operations $ 1,859,486 $ 1,441,187\nNon-marketable equity securities. Our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities consists of strategic investments in privately held companies.\nIn November 2023, we completed the sale of strategic investments in privately-held companies. The gain recognized from the sales was\n$55.1 million and included in interest and other income (expense), net, in our condensed consolidated statements of income. There were no\nmaterial impairments of non-marketable equity securities during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\nDerivatives\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and provide\nqualitative and quantitative disclosures about such derivatives. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in\nforeign currency exchange rates. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign\ncurrency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets\nand liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders,\nand (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe duration of forward contracts, the majority of which are short-term, ranges from approximately 2 months to 29 months at inception. We do\nnot use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with high credit\nquality financial institutions that are rated \"A\" or above and to date have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. In addition, we\nmitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty and anticipate continued\nperformance by all counterparties to such agreements.\nThe assets or liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets or accrued liabilities in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the\nforeign currency forward contract and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The cash flow impact upon settlement of the\nderivative contracts is included in net cash provided by operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCash Flow Hedging Activities\nCertain foreign exchange forward contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. These contracts have durations of approximately 29\nmonths or less. Certain forward contracts are rolled over periodically to capture the full length of exposure to our foreign currency risk, which can\nbe up to three years. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge,\nand the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on the hedged transactions. The related gains or losses\nresulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI)\nin stockholders’ equity and reclassified into revenue or operating expenses, as appropriate, at the time the hedged transactions affect earnings.\nWe expect a majority of the hedge balance in OCI to be reclassified to the statements of income within the next 12 months.\nWe did not record any gains or losses related to discontinuation of cash flow hedges during the nine months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\n17\nNon-designated Hedging Activities\nOur foreign exchange forward contracts that are used to hedge non-functional currency denominated balance sheet assets and liabilities are not\ndesignated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, any gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in\ninterest and other income (expense), net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses associated with\nthe underlying assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in interest and other income (expense), net. The duration of the forward contracts\nfor hedging our balance sheet exposure is approximately one month.\nWe also have certain foreign exchange forward contracts for hedging certain international revenues and expenses that are not designated as\nhedging instruments. Accordingly, any gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in interest and other\nincome (expense), net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses associated with the foreign\ncurrency in operating income. The duration of these forward contracts is usually less than one year. The overall goal of our hedging program is\nto minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on the net income over the fiscal year.\nThe effects of the non-designated derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of income are summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGains (losses) recorded in Interest and other income\n(expense), net $ 955 $ (1,205) $ (110) $ 3,532\nThe notional amounts in the table below for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding:\nAs of\nJuly 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nTotal gross notional amounts $ 1,816,755 $ 1,666,758\nNet fair value $ 5,768 $ (2,308)\nOur exposure to the market gains or losses will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. The amounts ultimately realized upon\nsettlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market\nconditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nThe following table represents the condensed consolidated balance sheets location and amount of derivative instrument fair values segregated\nbetween designated and non-designated hedge instruments:\nFair values of Fair values of\nderivative instruments derivative instruments\ndesignated as hedging not designated as\ninstruments hedging instruments\n(in thousands)\nBalance at July 31, 2024\nOther current assets $ 13,655 $ 820\nAccrued liabilities $ 7,498 $ 1,209\nBalance at October 31, 2023\nOther current assets $ 12,962 $ 491\nAccrued liabilities $ 14,665 $ 1,096\n18\nThe following table represents the location of the amount of gains and losses on derivative instrument fair values for designated hedge\ninstruments, net of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of income:\nAmount of Amount of\ngains (losses) gains (losses)\nLocation of recognized in OCI on Location of reclassified from\ngains (losses) recognized in derivatives gains (losses) OCI\nOCI on derivatives (effective portion) reclassified from OCI (effective portion)\n(in thousands)\nThree months ended\nJuly 31, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts Revenue $ 4,501 Revenue $ 2,689\nForeign exchange contracts Operating expenses (320) Operating expenses (611)\nTotal $ 4,181 $ 2,078\nThree months ended\nJuly 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contracts Revenue $ 899 Revenue $ (1,352)\nForeign exchange contracts Operating expenses 5,008 Operating expenses (3,898)\nTotal $ 5,907 $ (5,250)\nNine months ended\nJuly 31, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts Revenue $ 1,936 Revenue $ (1,593)\nForeign exchange contracts Operating expenses 5,720 Operating expenses (763)\nTotal $ 7,656 $ (2,356)\nNine months ended\nJuly 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contracts Revenue $ 7,315 Revenue $ (10,856)\nForeign exchange contracts Operating expenses 36,174 Operating expenses (12,025)\nTotal $ 43,489 $ (22,881)\nNote 10. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes guidelines and enhances disclosure requirements for fair\nvalue measurements. The accounting guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the independence of\nthe source and objective evidence of the inputs used. There are three fair value hierarchies based upon the level of inputs that are significant to\nfair value measurement:\nLevel 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs derived from fair valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable.\nOn a recurring basis, we measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, which include cash equivalents, short-term investments, non-\nqualified deferred compensation plan assets, and foreign currency derivative contracts.\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because they are valued using quoted market prices in\nan active market or alternative independent pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\n19\nOur non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market and mutual funds invested in domestic and international\nmarketable securities that are directly observable in active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1.\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because these contracts are not actively traded, and the valuation inputs\nare based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nOur borrowings under our credit and term loan facilities are classified within Level 2 because these borrowings are not actively traded and have\na variable interest rate structure based upon market rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities. See Note 11. Bridge\nCommitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more\ninformation on these borrowings.\nAssets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of July 31, 2024:\nFair Value Measurement Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Significant Other Unobservable\nfor Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 44,537 44,537 $ — $ —\nU.S. Treasury, agency & T-bills 7,446 — 7,446 —\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. Treasury, agency & T-bills 18,302 — 18,302 —\nCorporate debt securities 104,758 — 104,758 —\nAsset-backed securities 31,371 — 31,371 —\nPrepaid and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivative contracts 14,475 — 14,475 —\nOther long-term assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets 373,306 373,306 — —\nTotal assets $ 594,195 $ 417,843 $ 176,352 $ —\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities:\nForeign currency derivative contracts $ 8,707 $ — $ 8,707 $ —\nOther long-term liabilities:\nDeferred compensation plan liabilities 373,306 373,306 — —\nTotal liabilities $ 382,013 $ 373,306 $ 8,707 $ —\n20\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of October 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurement Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Significant Other Unobservable\nfor Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 10,129 $ 10,129 $ — $ —\nU.S. Treasury, agency & T-bills 2,994 — 2,994 —\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. Treasury, agency & T-bills 15,689 — 15,689 —\nMunicipal bonds 499 — 499 —\nCorporate debt securities 102,375 — 102,375 —\nAsset-backed securities 33,076 — 33,076 —\nPrepaid and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivative contracts 13,453 — 13,453 —\nOther long-term assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets 297,180 297,180 — —\nTotal assets $ 475,395 $ 307,309 $ 168,086 $ —\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities:\nForeign currency derivative contracts $ 15,761 $ — $ 15,761 $ —\nOther long-term liabilities:\nDeferred compensation plan liabilities 297,180 297,180 — —\nTotal liabilities $ 312,941 $ 297,180 $ 15,761 $ —\nAssets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 as they are valued using a combination of observable transaction price and\nunobservable inputs or data in an inactive market due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity.\nNote 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the\nsatisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Bridge Commitment. The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal\namount of up to $11.7 billion. The proceeds of any borrowing under the Bridge Commitment will be used for the purpose of financing a portion of\nthe cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe commitments to provide the Bridge Commitment may be terminated in whole or reduced in part, at our discretion. In addition, the Bridge\nCommitment Letter provides that net cash proceeds received from certain debt and equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and\nassets, including the pending Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan commitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will\nresult in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement in connection with the financing of the pending Ansys Merger. The Term Loan\nAgreement provides us with the ability to borrow up to $4.3 billion at the closing of the Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary\nclosing conditions for similar facilities, for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying\nrelated fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n21\nThe Term Loan Agreement provides for two tranches of senior unsecured term loans: a $1.45 billion tranche (Tranche 1) that matures two years\nafter funding and a $2.85 billion tranche (Tranche 2) that matures three years after funding. There was no outstanding balance under the Term\nLoan Agreement as of July 31, 2024.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring that Synopsys maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio commencing\nthe last day of the first fiscal quarter ending on or after the completion of the Ansys Merger, as well as other non-financial covenants. Under the\nTerm Loan Agreement, borrowings will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the\nAdjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Synopsys ranging\nfrom 0.875% to 1.375% (in the case of Tranche 1) or 1.000% to 1.500% (in the case of Tranche 2) or (ii) the ABR (as defined in the Term Loan\nAgreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Synopsys ranging from 0.000% to 0.375% (in the case of Tranche 1) or\n0.000% to 0.500% (in the case of Tranche 2).\nOn May 14, 2024, a ticking fee began to accrue under the Term Loan Agreement in an amount equal to a rate per annum equal to 0.10% times\nthe actual daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the term loan facility. This ticking fee will accrue until the earlier of (i)\ntermination or expiration of the commitments under the term loan facility or (ii) the funding of the commitments, at which point the accrued\namount of the ticking fee will become payable.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into a Sixth Amendment Agreement (the Sixth Amendment), which amended and restated our previous\nrevolving credit agreement, dated as of December 14, 2022 (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Agreement).\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides an unsecured $850.0 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and an unsecured\nuncommitted incremental revolving loan facility of up to $150.0 million. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is December 14, 2027,\nwhich may be extended at our option.\nUnder the Sixth Amendment, certain amendments became effective on February 13, 2024 and certain additional amendments will become\neffective upon the completion of the Ansys Merger. Upon the effective date, the Sixth Amendment amended the financial covenant to allow\nnetting of the cash proceeds of certain debt incurred to finance the Ansys Merger as well as certain other modifications set forth therein. Upon\nthe completion of the Ansys Merger, the Sixth Amendment, among other things: (i) amends the applicable margin used to determine the interest\nthat accrues on loans and the facility fee payable under the revolving credit facility to be based on our credit ratings, (ii) amends the financial\ncovenant thresholds under the financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Agreement requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage\nratio and (iii) amends certain conditions to borrowing, other non-financial covenants and events of default.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, as well as other\nnon-financial covenants. As of July 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant.\nInterest accrues on dollar-denominated loans at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in\nthe Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or (ii) the ABR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable\nmargin. The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate based loans ranges from 0.785% to 0.975%, based upon Synopsys’ consolidated\nleverage ratio. The applicable margin for ABR based loans is 0.000%. In addition to the interest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys is also\nrequired to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.09% to 0.15% based on Synopsys’ consolidated\nleverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nSubject to the completion of the Ansys Merger, interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement will accrue on dollar-denominated loans at a\nfloating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging\nfrom 0.795% to 1.200% or (ii) the ABR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging from 0.000% to 0.200%. In addition to the\ninterest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys will also be required to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging\nfrom 0.080% to 0.175% based on the credit ratings of Synopsys on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nThere was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million Renminbi (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support\nour facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of July 31, 2024, we had\n$15.6 million outstanding balance under the agreement.\n22\nThe carrying amount of the short-term and long-term debt approximates the estimated fair value.\nNote 12. Leases\nWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. These leases have various\nexpiration dates through December 31, 2042, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years. Because we are not\nreasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential\noption payments are excluded from lease payments.\nThe components of our lease expense during the period presented are as follows:\nThree Months Ended July 31, Nine Months Ended July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease expense (1) $ 23,800 $ 22,018 $ 67,848 $ 68,165\nVariable lease expense (2) 5,182 5,622 16,761 14,684\nTotal lease expense $ 28,982 $ 27,640 $ 84,609 $ 82,849\n(1) Operating lease expense includes immaterial amounts of short-term leases, net of sublease income.\n(2) Variable lease expense includes payments to lessors that are not fixed or determinable at lease commencement date.

Redeemable Non-controlling Interest\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired a 75% equity interest in OpenLight Photonics, Inc. (OpenLight) for cash consideration of\n$90.0 million. The remaining 25% equity interest in OpenLight is held by Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Minority Investor) from their contribution of\nIP and certain tangible assets.\nThe agreement with the Minority Investor contains redemption features whereby the interest held by the Minority Investor is redeemable either\n(1) at the option of the Minority Investor on or after the third anniversary of the acquisition or sooner in certain circumstances or (2) at our option\nbeginning on the third anniversary of the acquisition. This option is exercisable at the greater of fair value at the time of redemption or\n$30.0 million and was valued at $10.1 million, resulting in a total consideration of $100.1 million.\nDuring the nine months ended July 31, 2024, our ownership interest in OpenLight was reduced to 71% as a result of the recognition of non-\ncontrolling interest upon issuance of OpenLight stock.\nDuring the nine months ended July 31, 2024, OpenLight incurred a net loss of $28.9 million, of which $6.9 million was attributable to redeemable\nnon-controlling interest. As of July 31, 2024, the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest was recorded at its estimated fair value\nof $31.0 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n24\nNote 14.

See Note 9. Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 15. Stock Repurchase Program\nIn fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the Program) with authorization to purchase up to $1.5 billion of our\ncommon stock. As of July 31, 2024, $194.3 million remained available for future repurchases under the Program. However, in connection with\nthe pending Ansys Merger, we have suspended the Program until we are able to reduce our expected debt levels.\nStock repurchase activities as well as the reissuance of treasury stock for employee stock-based compensation purposes are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023(1)(2) 2024(3) 2023(1)\n(in thousands)\nTotal shares repurchased — 751 74 2,382\nTotal cost of the repurchased shares $ — $ 300,000 $ 45,000 $ 860,724\nReissuance of treasury stock 409 625 1,634 2,132\n(1) Excluded the 41,682 shares and $45.0 million equity forward contract from the May 2023 Accelerated Stock Repurchase program (ASR) settled in August\n2023.\n(2) Included the 105,792 shares and $45.0 million equity forward contract from the February 2023 ASR settled in May 2023.\n(3) Included the 73,903 shares and $45.0 million equity forward contract from the August 2023 ASR settled in November 2023.\n25\nNote 16.

The grant date fair\nvalue of the market-based RSUs and the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the grant date fair value during the\nperiods were as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\nExpected life (in years) 2.89 years 0.90 years - 2.70 years\nRisk-free interest rate 4.41% 4.36% - 4.63%\nVolatility 34.03% 35.84% - 42.86%\nGrant date fair value $600.29 $357.29 - $408.55\nAs of July 31, 2024, we had $1.3 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense from continuing and discontinued operations\nrelating to options, RSUs and restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, we had $70.3 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense from continuing and discontinued operations relating to\nour Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 2.0 years.\nThe intrinsic values of equity awards exercised from continuing and discontinued operations during the periods are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nIntrinsic value of awards exercised $ 90,973 $ 94,116 $ 166,993 $ 212,339\nNote 17. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nWe compute basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the dilution from potential common shares\noutstanding such as stock options and unvested RSUs and awards during the period using the treasury stock method.\n26\nThe table below reconciles the weighted average common shares used to calculate basic net income (loss) per share with the weighted average\ncommon shares used to calculate diluted net income (loss) per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income from continuing operations attributed to Synopsys $ 425,868 $ 335,708 $ 1,162,429 $ 880,994\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations attributed to\nSynopsys (17,813) 544 (13,155) (296)\nNet income attributed to Synopsys $ 408,055 $ 336,252 $ 1,149,274 $ 880,698\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares for basic net income per\nshare 153,417 152,023 152,885 152,204\nDilutive effect of common share equivalents from equity-\nbased compensation 2,714 2,924 2,978 2,915\nWeighted average common shares for diluted net income per\nshare 156,131 154,947 155,863 155,119\nNet income (loss) per share attributed to Synopsys - basic:\nContinuing operations $ 2.78 $ 2.21 $ 7.60 $ 5.79\nDiscontinued operations $ (0.12) $ — $ (0.08) $ —\nBasic net income per share $ 2.66 $ 2.21 $ 7.52 $ 5.79\nNet income (loss) per share attributed to Synopsys - diluted:\nContinuing operations $ 2.73 $ 2.17 $ 7.46 $ 5.68\nDiscontinued operations $ (0.12) $ — $ (0.09) $ —\nDiluted net income per share $ 2.61 $ 2.17 $ 7.37 $ 5.68\nAnti-dilutive employee stock-based awards excluded 211 289 203 454\nNote 18. Segment Disclosure\nSegment reporting is based upon the “management approach,” i.e., how management organizes our operating segments for which separate\nfinancial information is (1) available and (2) evaluated regularly by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing\nperformance. Our CODM is our CEO.\nWe have two reportable segments: (1) Design Automation, which includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services,\nsystem integration products and services, digital, custom and field programmable gate array (FPGA) IC design software, verification software\nand hardware products, manufacturing software products and other; and (2) Design IP, which includes our Design IP products.\nThe financial information provided to and used by the CODM to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources, and assessing\nperformance includes consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin\ninformation for the Design Automation and Design IP segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenue by geographic\nregion.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of the Software Integrity business are presented as discontinued operations in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of income and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all\nperiods presented. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n27\nInformation by reportable segment is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nTotal Segments:\nRevenue $ 1,525,749 $ 1,354,390 $ 4,491,450 $ 3,850,631\nAdjusted operating income 610,589 492,791 1,758,823 1,380,537\nAdjusted operating margin 40 % 36 % 39 % 36 %\nDesign Automation:\nRevenue $ 1,062,666 $ 1,004,156 $ 3,102,938 $ 2,821,570\nAdjusted operating income 440,864 410,023 1,218,574 1,102,837\nAdjusted operating margin 41 % 41 % 39 % 39 %\nDesign IP:\nRevenue $ 463,083 $ 350,234 $ 1,388,512 $ 1,029,061\nAdjusted operating income 169,725 82,768 540,249 277,700\nAdjusted operating margin 37 % 24 % 39 % 27 %\nCertain operating expenses are not allocated to the segments and are managed at a consolidated level. The unallocated expenses managed at\na consolidated level, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of deferred\ncompensation plan, restructuring charges, and acquisition/divestiture related items, are presented in the table below to provide a reconciliation of\nthe total adjusted operating income from segments to our consolidated operating income from continuing operations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nTotal segment adjusted operating income $ 610,589 $ 492,791 $ 1,758,823 $ 1,380,537\nReconciling items:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets (18,572) (13,008) (53,317) (38,632)\nStock-based compensation expense (164,354) (131,496) (492,550) (384,454)\nDeferred compensation plan (25,780) (21,492) (76,276) (44,123)\nRestructuring charges — (21,879) — (54,439)\nAcquisition/divestiture related items (41,672) (4,840) (91,771) (9,815)\nTotal operating income $ 360,211 $ 300,076 $ 1,044,909 $ 849,074\nThe CODM does not use total assets by segment to evaluate segment performance or allocate resources.

Income Taxes\nEffective Tax Rate\nWe estimate our annual effective tax rate at the end of each fiscal quarter. The effective tax rate takes into account our estimations of annual\npre-tax income, the geographic mix of pre-tax income and interpretations of tax laws and possible outcomes of audits.\nThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nIncome before income taxes $ 391,995 $ 325,560 $ 1,190,979 $ 901,705\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes $ (30,712) $ (6,951) $ 37,634 $ 29,779\nEffective tax rate (7.8)% (2.1)% 3.2 % 3.3 %\nOur effective tax rate for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, is lower than the statutory federal corporate tax rate of 21% primarily due to U.S.\nfederal research tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, U.S. foreign tax\ncredits, and tax benefits from a valuation allowance release against California research credits, partially offset by state taxes and the effect of\nnon-deductible stock-based compensation.\n29\nOur effective tax rate decreased in the three months ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2023, primarily due to the tax\nbenefits recorded as a result of the valuation allowance release. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 is consistent with\nthe same period in fiscal 2023.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations, and the amounts and timing of various tax payments that are part of the settlement\nprocess, are highly uncertain. Variations in such amounts and/or timing could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of\ncurrent and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that in the coming 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits and\nongoing tax litigation will conclude or the statute of limitations on certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes will expire, or both.\nGiven the uncertainty as to ultimate settlement terms, the timing of payment and the impact of such settlements on other uncertain tax positions,\nthe range of the estimated potential decrease in underlying unrecognized tax benefits is between $0 and $7.0 million.\nNon-U.S. Examinations\nHungarian Tax Authority\nIn 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) assessed withholding taxes of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0\nmillion against our Hungary subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary). Synopsys Hungary contested the assessment with the Hungarian Administrative\nCourt (Administrative Court). In fiscal 2018, Synopsys Hungary paid the assessment. Following years of litigation, the Administrative Court\nissued its written decision in favor of Synopsys Hungary on May 17, 2023, and the HTA subsequently refunded Synopsys Hungary the tax,\npenalty and interest paid in fiscal 2018, as well as additional interest totaling $39.1 million (including foreign currency effects). During the third\nquarter of fiscal 2023, we released our unrecognized tax benefit and offsetting U.S. foreign tax credits, resulting in a net benefit of $23.8 million.\nWe are also under examination by the tax authorities in certain other jurisdictions. No material assessments have been proposed in these\nexaminations.\nLegislative Developments\nEffective our fiscal 2024, we are subject to the new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022. We do not expect any impact of CAMT in fiscal 2024.\nOn January 31, 2024, the House of Representatives has passed the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024 (H.R. 7024)\nwhich would defer the requirement of capitalizing research and development, based in the United States, until tax years starting after December\n31, 2025. The proposed legislation would have a beneficial impact on our cash tax liabilities, if enacted. The Senate rejected the bill in August\n2024 and its future remains uncertain.\nOn June 27, 2024, California enacted SB-167, which suspends the use of California net operating loss and limits the use of California research\ntax credits to $5 million each year for our fiscal 2025-2027. On June 29, 2024, California enacted SB-175, which provides a refund mechanism\nfor the incremental tax that was paid as a result of SB-167. We are evaluating the impact of the law change.\nNote 21. Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are subject to routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business.\nThe ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations\nand financial condition. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss\nfrom any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal\nproceedings are inherently uncertain and, as circumstances change, it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase,\ndecrease or be eliminated.\nWe have determined that, except as set forth below, no disclosure of estimated loss is required for a claim against us because: (1) there is not a\nreasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (2) a reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (3) such estimate is immaterial.\n30\nLegal Settlement\nIn March 2017, Siemens PLM Software (now Siemens Industry Software Inc. or SISW) acquired Mentor Graphics Corporation (Mentor). On June\n29, 2018, we, SISW and Mentor settled all outstanding patent litigation between us and Mentor for a $65.0 million payment made from us to\nMentor. As a result of the settlement, the litigation with Mentor was dismissed and the injunction entered in connection with that litigation was\nvacated. The settlement included mutual seven-year patent cross-licenses between us and SISW, and between us and Mentor. We and Mentor\nalso amended an existing interoperability agreement to collaborate on a wide range of EDA products for the benefit of our mutual customers (the\ninteroperability amendment). The interoperability amendment includes a one-time termination charge between $0.0 and $25.0 million, payable to\nSISW under certain conditions. Mentor no longer exists as an independent entity and is succeeded by SISW.\nIn June 2024, the parties extended the existing patent cross-license to December 31, 2031, and entered into a new cross-license of patents\nrelated to certain computer-aided engineering technology. The new cross-license is conditioned on the close of the Ansys Merger and expires on\nDecember 31, 2031. The interoperability amendment expires by its terms on June 29, 2025.\nTax Matters\nWe undergo examination from time to time by U.S. and foreign authorities for non-income based taxes, such as sales, use and value-added\ntaxes, and are currently under examination by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. If the potential loss from such examinations is considered\nprobable and the amount or the range of loss could be estimated, we would accrue a liability for the estimated expense.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we are, from time to time, party to various other claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business,\nincluding with tax and other governmental authorities. For a description of certain of these other matters, see Note 20. Income Taxes of the\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n31\nItem 2.

All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements\nattributable to Synopsys or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\nThe following summary and overview of our financial condition and results of operations are qualified in their entirety by the more complete\ndiscussions and should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in Part I,\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report, the risk factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, and with our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, as filed with\nthe SEC on December 12, 2023 (our Annual Report).\nOverview\nUnless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates solely to our\ncontinuing operations and does not include the operations of our Software Integrity business. See “Pending Software Integrity Divestiture” below\nand Note 3. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the\nSoftware Integrity Divestiture.\nFinancial Performance Summary\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our results reflect continued, strong execution and the resiliency of our business. We have seen our customer\nset expand as more companies in more industries define and optimize system performance at the silicon level. We also continue to see our total\ncost of revenue and operating expenses increase as we invest in our workforce and further grow organically and through acquisitions. The\nfollowing table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information:\nThree Months Ended July 31, Nine Months Ended July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 1,525.7 $ 1,354.4 $ 4,491.5 $ 3,850.6\nCost of revenue $ 290.7 $ 260.4 $ 870.3 $ 744.7\n32\nOperating expenses $ 874.9 $ 793.9 $ 2,576.3 $ 2,256.9\nOperating income $ 360.2 $ 300.1 $ 1,044.9 $ 849.1\nNet income from continuing operations attributed to Synopsys $ 425.9 $ 335.7 $ 1,162.4 $ 881.0\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations attributed to\nSynopsys $ (17.8) $ 0.5 $ (13.2) $ (0.3)\nDiluted net income (loss) per share attributed to Synopsys:\nContinuing operations $ 2.73 $ 2.17 $ 7.46 $ 5.68\nDiscontinued operations $ (0.12) $ — $ (0.09) $ —\nThree months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023 financial performance summary\n• Revenues were $1.5 billion, an increase of $171.3 million or 13%, primarily due to revenue growth across a majority of products and\ngeographies.\n• Total cost of revenue and operating expenses was $1.2 billion, an increase of $111.3 million or 11%, primarily due to an increase of\n$49.6 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.\n• Operating income was $360.2 million, an increase of $60.1 million or 20%.\nNine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023 financial performance summary\n• Revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of $640.9 million or 17%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies\nand the impact of the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.1\n• Total cost of revenue and operating expenses was $3.4 billion, an increase of $445.0 million or 15%, primarily due to an increase of\n$227.6 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions, and the impact of\nthe extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n• Operating income was $1.0 billion, an increase of $195.8 million or 23%.\nBusiness Summary\nSynopsys delivers trusted and comprehensive silicon to systems design solutions, from electronic design automation (EDA), including system\nverification and validation solutions, to silicon intellectual property (IP). We partner closely with semiconductor and systems customers across a\nwide range of industries to maximize their research and development capability and productivity. Synopsys is catalyzing the era of pervasive\nintelligence to power innovation today that ignites the ingenuity of tomorrow. For more information about our business segments and product\ngroups, see Part I, Item 1, Business in our Annual Report.\nWe have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our\nsolid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses\nover the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of\nPresentation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The\nrevenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result,\ndecreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.\nOur growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our Design Automation products, expanding and proliferating our\nDesign IP offerings and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is\nexpected to vary based on the mix of our time-based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business\nmodel, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.\n1 Refer to \"Fiscal Year and Fiscal Quarter End\" in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations for the extra week discussion.\n33\nPending Acquisition of Ansys\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of\nAnsys, a provider of broad engineering simulation and analysis software and services, in a cash-and-stock transaction (the Ansys Merger) that\nvalues Ansys at approximately $35.0 billion, based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 2023.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Ansys Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Ansys common stock\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (with certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into\nthe right to receive 0.3450 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of Synopsys common stock and $197.00 in cash, without interest. The Exchange\nRatio is expected to result in Ansys equityholders and Synopsys equityholders owning approximately 16.5% and 83.5%, respectively, of the\ncombined company on a pro forma basis following the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement also provides for Synopsys’ assumption of certain\noutstanding Ansys options and other unvested Ansys equity awards held by continuing Ansys employees. If the stock consideration to be issued\nby Synopsys in connection with the Ansys Merger exceeds 19.9999% of the shares of Synopsys common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that the aggregate\nnumber of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Ansys Merger does not exceed such threshold, and the cash\nconsideration will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, two members of the board of directors of Ansys selected by mutual agreement of\nSynopsys and Ansys will become members of the Board of Directors of Synopsys. If the closing occurs less than six months prior to the next\nannual meeting of Synopsys’ stockholders, Synopsys will nominate such directors for election at such meeting. On March 19, 2024, Synopsys\nand Ansys mutually agreed to designate Dr. Ajei Gopal, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of Ansys, to become a member of the\nSynopsys Board of Directors at the Effective Time, subject to the completion of Synopsys’ director nomination process and satisfaction of all\napplicable eligibility requirements established by Synopsys’ Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Ansys and Synopsys have not\nyet determined or agreed on the remaining member of the Ansys board of directors to be appointed to the Synopsys Board of Directors.\nThe Ansys Merger was approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ansys common stock on May 22, 2024 and is\nanticipated to close in the first half of calendar year 2025. The Ansys Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing\nconditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as\namended (the HSR Act), the clearance of the Ansys Merger under certain other antitrust and foreign investment regimes, and the continued\neffectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-277912) filed by us on March 14, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC\non April 17, 2024. We and Ansys each have termination rights under the Merger Agreement. A fee of $1.5 billion may be payable by us to Ansys,\nor a fee of $950.0 million may be payable by Ansys to us, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, each as\nmore fully described in the Merger Agreement. The receipt of financing by us is not a condition to complete the Ansys Merger.\nIn connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on January 15, 2024 (the Bridge Commitment\nLetter) with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, a senior unsecured\nbridge facility (the Bridge Commitment). The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $11.7 billion. On\nFebruary 13, 2024, we entered into a term loan facility credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement), which provides us with the ability to borrow\nup to $4.3 billion at the closing of the Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for similar facilities, for the\npurpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with\nthe Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See Note 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and\nRevolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Bridge Commitment and\nthe Term Loan Agreement.\nFor more on risks related to the Ansys Merger, see Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Risks Related to the Ansys Merger\" of this Quarterly Report.\nImpact of the Current Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including the effects of, among other things, sustained global inflationary pressures and interest\nrates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and\nassociated global economic conditions, have resulted in volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. We expect growth across our\ngeographies in\n34\nfiscal 2024; however, we are expecting a challenging near-term growth environment in China due to macroeconomic factors as well as, to a\nlesser degree, entity list and trade restrictions as further discussed below and in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report.\nThe current uncertain macroeconomic environment could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their\nspending and/or delay their payments to us. For more on risks related to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, see Part II,\nItem 1A, Risk Factors, “Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries,\nmay negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition” of this Quarterly Report.\nWe are also actively monitoring geopolitical pressures around the world, including, among others, changes in China-Taiwan relations, the\nconflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and other regional or global military conflicts. Any significant disruption caused by these or other\ngeopolitical pressures or conflicts could materially affect our employees, business, operating results, financial condition or customers in those\nregions of the world. For example, Synopsys has employees, operations, customers and strategic partners in the Middle East and in Armenia,\nwhich are each impacted by geopolitical conflicts. While we are actively monitoring these conflicts, at this time, these geopolitical conflicts have\nnot had a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWhile our time-based business model provides stability to our business, operating results and overall financial position, the broader implications\nof these macroeconomic or geopolitical events, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. Further, the negative impact of these events or\ndisruptions may be deferred due to our business model.\nSee Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the impact of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty on\nour business, operations and financial condition.\nDevelopments in Export Control Regulations\nOn October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control\nregulations (U.S. Export Regulations), including new restrictions on Chinese entities' ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and\nmaintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Further, on October 14, 2022, a new rule went into effect imposing U.S.\nexport controls on additional technologies, including electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of ICs\nwith Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor structures. On October 17, 2023, the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security,\npublished clarifications of and other adjustments to the regulations promulgated on October 7, 2022, pertaining, among other things, to China’s\naccess to certain semiconductor and advanced computing technology. Based on our current understanding, we believe these regulations will not\nhave a material impact on our business. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. Export Regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the\nscope or timing of such changes. We will continue to monitor such developments, including potential additional trade restrictions, and other\nregulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments.\nFor more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and other U.S. Export\nRegulations, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, “We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability\nand restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.”\nPending Software Integrity Divestiture\nOn May 5, 2024, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), by and between Synopsys, Inc. and Sapphire\nSoftware Buyer, Inc. (Buyer), an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and Francisco Partners (together, the\nSponsors). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions specified therein, we\nwill sell our Software Integrity business to Buyer for a purchase price of up to $2.1 billion in cash, comprised of: (i) $1.5 billion, payable at\nclosing; (ii) $125 million, payable in equal installments over five fiscal quarters beginning on the first business day after the 75th day of our first\nfull fiscal quarter following the closing, subject to acceleration at our option prior to the closing of the Ansys Merger; and (iii) up to $475 million\n(the Conditional Transaction Consideration), payable upon the Sponsors achieving a specified rate of return in connection with one or more\npotential liquidity transactions. The Software Integrity Divestiture is currently expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary\nclosing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The Software Integrity business met the criteria to be disclosed as\ndiscontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information on discontinued\n35\noperations.\nBusiness Segments\nDesign Automation. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services and system integration products. This\nsegment also includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit (IC) design software, verification software and\nhardware products, system integration products and services, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate\nthe highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end\nproducts.\nDesign IP. This segment includes our Design IP products that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. We are\na leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address\nspecific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to\nquickly develop SoCs in these areas.\nFiscal Year and Fiscal Quarter End\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we\nhave a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar\nquarters. Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week year ending on November 2, 2024, which impacts our revenue, expenses and operating results. Fiscal 2023\nwas a 52-week year and ended on October 28, 2023.\nOur results of operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 included 40 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively, and ended on\nAugust 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. The extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted in approximately $70.5 million of\nadditional revenue, and approximately $61.0 million of additional expenses, including approximately $11.0 million in stock-based compensation\ncosts. For presentation purposes, this Form 10-Q refers to the closest calendar month end.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.\nGAAP). In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various\nother assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this\nQuarterly Report for more information on our significant accounting policies.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to\nunderstanding our results of operations, are:\n• Revenue recognition; and\n• Business combinations.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates section of Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations in our Annual Report for more information.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenues are generated from two business segments: the Design Automation segment and the Design IP segment. See Note 18. Segment\nDisclosure of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for more information about our reportable\nsegments and revenue by geographic regions.\nFurther disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:\nDesign Automation Segment\n36\n• EDA solutions include digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, system integration\nproducts and services, and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically\nsold through Technology Subscription License (TSL) arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the\nlicensed products at the outset of an arrangement; software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the\narrangement. The duration of our TSL contracts is generally three years, though it may vary for specific arrangements. We have\nconcluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to\nthe licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single,\ncombined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize\nrevenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license.\n• In the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first\nperformance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware\nproduct. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes\nrights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-\nbased pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally\nrecognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have\nconcluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and\nan obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as\nrevenue ratably over the maintenance term.\n• Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure\nprogress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of\ninternal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification\nand testing requirement changes.\nDesign IP Segment\n• Design IP includes our Synopsys IP portfolio. These arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of\ntransferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are\nprovided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at\na point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is\nrecognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its\nproducts that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the\ncustomization of certain IP is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress.\nOur customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights, and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of\nthese arrangements. For example, they generally request a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms\nsuch as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our\ncustomers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the\ntotal value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.\n37\nTotal Revenue\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months ended\nDesign Automation $ 1,062.6 $ 1,004.2 $ 58.4 6 %\nDesign IP 463.1 350.2 112.9 32 %\nTotal $ 1,525.7 $ 1,354.4 $ 171.3 13 %\nNine months ended\nDesign Automation $ 3,103.0 $ 2,821.5 $ 281.5 10 %\nDesign IP 1,388.5 1,029.1 359.4 35 %\nTotal $ 4,491.5 $ 3,850.6 $ 640.9 17 %\nOur revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For\nexample, we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\ndrawdowns, royalties, and hardware products sales. As revenues from IP products sales and hardware products sales are recognized upfront,\ncustomer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware products could result in increased variability of our total revenues.\nContracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations (backlog) as of July 31, 2024 were $7.9 billion, which includes $1.2\nbillion in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to\nbe determined by customers at a later date. We have elected to exclude future sales-based royalty payments from the remaining performance\nobligations. Approximately 40% of the backlog as of July 31, 2024, excluding non-cancellable FSA, is expected to be recognized as revenue\nover the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The majority of the remaining backlog is expected to be recognized in the\nfollowing three years.\nThe amount and composition of unsatisfied performance obligations will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount of unsatisfied\nperformance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue, or that such obligations at the end of any given period correlates with actual\nsales performance of a particular geography or particular products and services. For more information regarding our revenue during the three\nand nine months ended July 31, 2024, including our contract balances as of such date, see Note 6. Revenue of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.\nThe increase in total revenues for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2023 was due\nprincipally to revenue growth across a majority of products and geographies. The increase for the nine-month period also included the impact of\nthe extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately $70.5 million.\nFor a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 18. Segment Disclosure of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements in this Quarterly Report.\nTime-Based Products Revenue\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months ended $ 803.1 $ 827.4 $ (24.3) (3)%\nPercentage of total revenue 53 % 61 %\nNine months ended $ 2,389.9 $ 2,235.5 $ 154.4 7 %\nPercentage of total revenue 53 % 58 %\nThe decrease in time-based products revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily attributable to a decrease in TSL license revenue from previously unfulfilled contracts that have expired and are no longer subject to an\nimplied promise to provide future services.\n38\nThe increase in time-based products revenue for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was primarily\nattributable to an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and the impact of the extra week in the first quarter\nof fiscal 2024.\nUpfront Products Revenue\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months ended $ 442.5 $ 292.7 $ 149.8 51 %\nPercentage of total revenue 29 % 22 %\nNine months ended $ 1,281.3 $ 958.6 $ 322.7 34 %\nPercentage of total revenue 29 % 25 %\nChanges in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements, which\ncan drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.\nThe increase in upfront products revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to an increase in the sale of IP and hardware products, driven by higher demand from customers.\nUpfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP and hardware product sales. Such\nfluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments and FSA drawdowns due to customer requirements.\nMaintenance and Service Revenue\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months ended\nMaintenance revenue $ 105.8 $ 111.1 $ (5.3) (5)%\nProfessional service and other revenue 174.3 123.2 51.1 41 %\nTotal $ 280.1 $ 234.3 $ 45.8 20 %\nPercentage of total revenue 18 % 17 %\nNine months ended\nMaintenance revenue $ 318.0 $ 271.3 $ 46.7 17 %\nProfessional service and other revenue 502.2 385.2 117.0 30 %\nTotal $ 820.2 $ 656.5 $ 163.7 25 %\nPercentage of total revenue 18 % 17 %\nThe decrease in maintenance revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was primarily due\nto a decrease in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance. The increase in maintenance revenue for the nine months ended\nJuly 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include\nmaintenance.\nThe increase in professional service and other revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same periods in\nfiscal 2023 was primarily due to the timing of IP customization projects.\n39\nCost of Revenue\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months ended\nCost of products revenue $ 179.5 $ 174.5 $ 5.0 3 %\nCost of maintenance and service revenue 96.6 75.0 21.6 29 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 14.5 11.0 3.5 32 %\nTotal $ 290.6 $ 260.5 $ 30.1 12 %\nPercentage of total revenue 19 % 19 %\nNine months ended\nCost of products revenue $ 553.8 $ 500.1 $ 53.7 11 %\nCost of maintenance and service revenue 275.3 211.8 63.5 30 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 41.2 32.7 8.5 26 %\nTotal $ 870.3 $ 744.6 $ 125.7 17 %\nPercentage of total revenue 19 % 19 %\nWe divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of\nacquired intangible assets.\nCost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware-related costs\nincluding inventory provisions, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the\namortization of capitalized software development costs.\nCost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance services, such\nas hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, included in cost of revenue, consists of the amortization of\ncore/developed technology and certain contract rights intangible assets related to acquisitions.\nThe increase in cost of revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to\nincreases of $16.1 million in costs to fulfill IP consulting arrangements, $7.2 million in employee-related costs as a result of headcount increases\nfrom hiring, $3.9 million in hardware-related costs including inventory provisions, and $3.5 million in amortization of acquired technology-related\nintangible assets.\nThe increase in cost of revenue for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to\nincreases of $45.1 million in costs to fulfill IP consulting arrangements, $34.6 million in hardware-related costs including inventory provisions,\n$30.0 million in employee-related

The increase for the nine-\nmonth period also included the impact of gain recognized from the sale of strategic investments.\nSegment Operating Results\nWe do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. These unallocated expenses\nconsist primarily of amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of deferred\ncompensation plan, restructuring charges, and acquisition/divestiture\n42\nrelated items.

Our effective tax rate for the nine months\nended July 31, 2024 is consistent with the same period in fiscal 2023.\nSee Note 20. Income Taxes of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit\nand term loan facilities.\nAs of July 31, 2024, we held $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also held $2.2 million in restricted cash\nprimarily associated with deposits for office leases and employee loan programs. Our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money\nmarket mutual funds, time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments include\nU.S. government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt and asset backed securities with an overall weighted-\naverage credit rating of approximately AA.\nAs of July 31, 2024, approximately $968.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. We have\nprovided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our\n43\nforeign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.\nWe expect that the pending Ansys Merger is likely to result in a material increase in our debt and liquidity needs that will impact our capital needs\nduring as well as beyond the next twelve months. We intend to fund our anticipated $19 billion cash consideration payment through a\ncombination of cash and debt, and have fully-committed debt financing in place for $16.0 billion. Net cash proceeds received from certain debt\nand equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and assets, including the pending Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan\ncommitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will result in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment. See\nNote 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in\nthis Quarterly Report for further discussion.\nEffective fiscal 2023, our research and development expenditures were required to be capitalized and amortized under the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct instead of being deducted when incurred for US tax purposes, which significantly increases our federal cash tax liability. Additionally, as a\nresult of the IRS tax relief for the California winter storms, the due date for our fiscal 2023 federal tax payment was November 16, 2023 and as\nsuch, we deferred our fiscal 2023 federal cash tax payments until the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This resulted in a significant increase to our\ncash outflows beginning in fiscal 2024.\nAs of July 31, 2024, $194.3 million remained available for future stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program (the Program). We have\nsuspended the Program in connection with the pending Ansys Merger until we are able to reduce our expected debt levels.\nDuring the nine months ended July 31, 2024, there were no other significant changes to our material cash requirements, including contractual\nand other obligations, as presented in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in our Annual Report.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and\nsources of liquidity, as well as the committed debt financing related to the pending Ansys Merger, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash\nrequirements over the next twelve-month period and beyond. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of\nrevenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and\ndevelopment efforts, and our investments in or acquisitions of businesses, applications or technologies.\nThe following sections discuss changes in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and other commitments of our liquidity and\ncapital resources during the nine months ended July 31, 2024.\nCash Flows\nOur condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include cash flows related to the Software Integrity business. Significant non-cash items\nand capital expenditures of discontinued operations related to our Software Integrity business are presented separately in Note 3. Discontinued\nOperations of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.\nNine Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 $ Change\n(dollars in millions)\nCash provided by operating activities $ 844.2 $ 1,377.2 $ (533.0)\nCash used in investing activities (220.0) (181.6) (38.4)\nCash used in financing activities (211.4) (942.6) 731.2\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our\noperating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon\nthe payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based\nproducts revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.\n44\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to higher federal tax payments of $417.0 million, which included $187.0 million of fiscal 2023 federal tax payments that were paid in\nfiscal 2024 as a result of payment deadline extensions due to IRS tax relief for the California winter storms.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of $105.6 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the maturities and sales of\ninvestments of $42.8 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of $17.7 million.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to lower stock repurchases of $905.7 million, as we have suspended the Program in connection with the pending Ansys Merger\nuntil we reduce our expected debt levels, partially offset by higher income taxes paid for net share settlements of $79.6 million, the payment of\nbridge financing and term loan costs of $72.3 million in connection with the Ansys Merger, and lower proceeds from the issuance of common\nstock of $21.7 million.\nBridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the\nsatisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Bridge Commitment. The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal\namount of up to $11.7 billion. The proceeds of any borrowing under the Bridge Commitment will be used for the purpose of financing a portion of\nthe cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe commitments to provide the Bridge Commitment may be terminated in whole or reduced in part, at our discretion. In addition, the Bridge\nCommitment Letter provides that net cash proceeds received from certain debt and equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and\nassets, including the pending Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan commitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will\nresult in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement in connection with the financing of the pending Ansys Merger. The Term Loan\nAgreement provides us with the ability to borrow up to $4.3 billion at the closing of the Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary\nclosing conditions for similar facilities, for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying\nrelated fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement provides for two tranches of senior unsecured term loans: a $1.45 billion tranche (Tranche 1) that matures two years\nafter funding and a $2.85 billion tranche (Tranche 2) that matures three years after funding. There was no outstanding balance under the Term\nLoan Agreement as of July 31, 2024.\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, borrowings will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’\nelection, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of\nSynopsys ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% (in the case of Tranche 1) or 1.000% to 1.500% (in the case of Tranche 2) or (ii) the ABR (as defined\nin the Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Synopsys ranging from 0.000% to 0.375% (in the case of\nTranche 1) or 0.000% to 0.500% (in the case of Tranche 2).\nOn May 14, 2024, a ticking fee began to accrue under the Term Loan Agreement in an amount equal to a rate per annum equal to 0.10% times\nthe actual daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the term loan facility. This ticking fee will accrue until the earlier of (i)\ntermination or expiration of the commitments under the term loan facility or (ii) the funding of the commitments, at which point the accrued\namount of the ticking fee will become payable.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring that Synopsys maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio commencing\nthe last day of the first fiscal quarter ending on or after the completion of the Ansys Merger, as well as other non-financial covenants.\n45\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into a Sixth Amendment Agreement (the Sixth Amendment), which amended and restated our previous\nrevolving credit agreement, dated as of December 14, 2022 (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Agreement).\nUnder the Sixth Amendment, certain amendments became effective on February 13, 2024 and certain additional amendments will become\neffective upon the completion of the Ansys Merger. Upon the effective date, the Sixth Amendment amended the financial covenant to allow\nnetting of the cash proceeds of certain debt incurred to finance the Ansys Merger as well as certain other modifications set forth therein. Upon\nthe completion of the Ansys Merger, the Sixth Amendment, among other things:\n• amends the applicable margin used to determine the interest that accrues on loans and the facility fee payable under the revolving credit\nfacility to be based on our credit ratings;\n• amends the financial covenant thresholds under the financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Agreement requiring us to maintain a\nmaximum consolidated leverage ratio; and\n• amends certain conditions to borrowing, other non-financial covenants and events of default.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides an unsecured $850.0 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and an unsecured\nuncommitted incremental revolving loan facility of up to $150.0 million. The maturity date of the revolving loan facility is December 14, 2027,\nwhich may be extended at Synopsys’ option. There was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of July 31, 2024.\nInterest accrues on dollar-denominated loans at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in\nthe Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or (ii) the ABR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable\nmargin. The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate based loans ranges from 0.785% to 0.975%, based upon Synopsys’ consolidated\nleverage ratio. The applicable margin for ABR based loans is 0.000%. In addition to the interest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys is also\nrequired to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.09% to 0.15% based on Synopsys’ consolidated\nleverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nSubject to the completion of the Ansys Merger, interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement will accrue on dollar-denominated loans at a\nfloating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging\nfrom 0.795% to 1.200% or (ii) the ABR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging from 0.000% to 0.200%. In addition to the\ninterest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys will also be required to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging\nfrom 0.080% to 0.175% based on the credit ratings of Synopsys on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, as well as other\nnon-financial covenants. As of July 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million Renminbi (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support\nour facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5 year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of July 31, 2024, we had\n$15.6 million outstanding balance under the agreement.\nSee Note 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements in this Quarterly Report for more information.\n46\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nSee Note 11. Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part I of this\nQuarterly Report regarding borrowings under our Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 3, 2024, our exposure to market risk had not changed materially since October 28, 2023. For more information on financial market\nrisks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates, reference is made to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk contained in Part II of our Annual Report.\n47\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of August 3, 2024, Synopsys carried out an evaluation under the supervision and\nwith the participation of Synopsys’ management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of Synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness\nof any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of August 3, 2024,\nSynopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in\nthe reports Synopsys files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required,\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to Synopsys’ management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding its required disclosure.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in Synopsys’ internal control over financial reporting during\nthe fiscal quarter ended August 3, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Synopsys’ internal control\nover financial reporting.\n48\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business.\nThe ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations\nand financial condition. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Synopsys because of the defense costs, diversion of\nmanagement resources and other factors.\nWe regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal\nproceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are inherently\nuncertain and as circumstances change, it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase, decrease or be eliminated.\nWe are not aware of any legal proceedings that would materially impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\n49\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIndustry Risks\n• Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively\naffect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n• The growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries.\n• We operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower\ncosts, our products may not be competitive or may become obsolete.\n• We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our\nproducts and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.\n• Consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small\nnumber of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results.\nBusiness Operations Risks\n• The global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations.\n• Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price.\n• Cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could\nharm our business and our reputation.\n• If we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed.\n• We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transactions we complete, or find suitable target\nbusinesses and technology to acquire.\n• We may fail to complete the divestiture of our Software Integrity business, and a completed divestiture may disrupt our remaining\nbusiness or not achieve its intended benefits.\n• If we fail to timely recruit and/or retain senior management and key employees globally, our business may be harmed.\n• We may pursue new product and technology initiatives, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, we could be adversely\nimpacted.\n• We may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively affect our operating results.\n• Product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share.\n• Our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks.\n• From time to time, we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.\n• We may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which\nmay disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\n• In preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our\nconsolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\n• Liquidity requirements in our U.S. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our\nfinancial condition.\nRisks Related to the Ansys Merger\n• We may fail to complete the Ansys Merger or may not complete it on the terms described herein or in our other filings with the SEC.\n• The Ansys Merger is subject to the receipt of governmental approvals that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on\nus or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Ansys Merger.\n• Failure to realize the benefits expected from the Ansys Merger could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\n50\n• As a result of the Ansys Merger, we anticipate that the scope and size of our operations and business will substantially change and will\nresult in certain incremental risks to us, including increased competition. We may not realize the full expected benefits of the Ansys\nMerger.\n• Our significant debt may limit our financial flexibility following the Ansys Merger.\n• The covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness following the Ansys Merger may impose restrictions on us and\ncertain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n• Our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable\ngovernment reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, or future\nchanges to our tax structure.\n• Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to\nenvironmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n• Changes in the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) could adversely affect our financial results and may require\nsignificant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\n• We may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business.\n• There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs.\nGeneral Risks\n• Our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets.\n• Catastrophic events and the effects of climate change, pandemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our business and harm our\noperating results.\nFactors that May Affect Future Results\nA description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. Some of these risks are highlighted in the following discussion\nand in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Legal Proceedings, and Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Quarterly Report. The occurrence of any of these risks or additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\noperating results and stock price. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated\nby the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Investors should carefully consider all relevant risks and uncertainties\nbefore investing in our common stock.\nIndustry Risks\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, may\nnegatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including the effects of, among other things, sustained global inflationary pressures and interest\nrates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and\nassociated global economic conditions, have resulted in volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. This uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us.\nSuch caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed\ncontracts.\nIf these macroeconomic uncertainties persist and economic conditions continue to deteriorate, then the semiconductor and electronics industries\ncould fail to grow. Additionally, uncertain macroeconomic conditions could also have the effect of increasing other risks and uncertainties facing\nour business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Such risks that may be heightened by\nuncertain macroeconomic conditions include China’s stated policy of becoming a global leader in the semiconductor industry, which may lead to\nincreased competition or further disruption of international trade relationships, including, but not limited to, additional government trade\nrestrictions. For more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and Export\nRegulations (as defined below), see “We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict\nour ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.”\n51\nAdverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that our products help create, such as the ICs incorporated in personal computers,\nsmartphones, automobiles and servers. Longer-term reduced demand for these or other products could result in reduced demand for design\nsolutions and significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales over time. Future economic downturns could also adversely\naffect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if our customers or distributors build elevated inventory levels, we could\nexperience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand for our products. If any of these events or disruptions were to occur, the demand\nfor our products and services could be adversely affected along with our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, due to\nour business model, the negative impact of these events or disruptions may not be immediately realized.\nFurther economic uncertainty could also adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in bank failures or credit\ndowngrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them\nto default on their obligations. Additionally, the banking and financial services industries are subject to complex laws and are heavily regulated.\nThere is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the laws, policies and regulations governing the banking and\nfinancial services industry could affect our business. A deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain\nexternal financing to fund our operations, capital expenditures or pending acquisitions, such as the Ansys Merger. In addition, difficult economic\nconditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. Any of the foregoing could cause adverse\neffects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries.\nThe growth of the EDA industry as a whole and our sales in our Design Automation and Design IP segments are dependent on the\nsemiconductor and electronics industries. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design\nprojects by semiconductor manufacturers, systems companies and their customers. The increasing complexity of designs of SoCs, ICs,\nelectronic systems and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led to, and in the future could lead to, a decrease in design\nstarts and design activity in general. For example, in response to this increasing complexity, some customers may choose to focus on one\ndiscrete phase of the design process or opt for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced\nEDA products. Demand for our products and services could decrease and our business, operating results and financial condition could be\nadversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls, including, among other things, due to sustained\nglobal inflationary pressures and interest rates, a continued or worsening global supply chain disruption, geopolitical pressures or economic\nslowdowns or recessions. Additionally, as the EDA industry has matured, stronger competition has emerged from companies better able to\ncompete as sole source vendors. This increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our\noperating margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex and interconnected ecosystems. Many of our\ncustomers outsource the manufacturing of their semiconductor designs to foundries. Our customers also frequently incorporate third-party IP,\nwhether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. We work closely with major\nfoundries to ensure that our EDA, IP and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. Similarly, we work closely\nwith other major providers of semiconductor IP, particularly microprocessor IP, to optimize our EDA tools for use with their IP designs and to\nassure that their IP and our own IP products work effectively together, as we may each provide for the design of separate components on the\nsame chip. If we fail to optimize our EDA and IP solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major IP providers’ products,\nor if our access to such foundry processes or third-party IP products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our\ncustomers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at\nlower costs, our products may not be competitive or may become obsolete.\nIn our Design Automation segment, we compete against EDA vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as Cadence Design\nSystems, Inc. and Siemens EDA. We also compete with other EDA vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products\nfocused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process. Moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that\ncompete with our products. In our Design IP segment, we compete against a growing number of silicon IP providers as well as our customers’\ninternally developed IP.\n52\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, with new competitors entering these markets both domestically and internationally.\nFor example, China has implemented national policies favoring Chinese companies and has formed government-backed investment funds as it\nseeks to build independent EDA capabilities and compete internationally in the semiconductor industry. The demand for our products and\nservices is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including, among other things, demand for our customers’ products, design starts and\nour customers’ budgetary constraints. Technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and\nimprovements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. For example, the adoption of cloud computing and AI\ntechnologies can bring new demand and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings.\nOur efforts in developing such new technology solutions, including, for example, our current efforts in creating cloud computing and AI solutions,\nmay not succeed. Semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, which substantially\nincreases the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. At the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to\ndemand a lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases from one vendor. In order to succeed in this\nenvironment, we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to\nreduce their overall costs and our own operating costs.\nWe compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (such as ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract\ncustomer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. Specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect\nour success:\n• Our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve\nour existing software and hardware products, and successfully develop or acquire such new products;\n• Our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of\nindividual product performance;\n• Our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms;\n• Our ability to manage an efficient supply chain to ensure hardware product availability;\n• Our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and\n• Our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products.\nIf we fail to successfully manage any of these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology\nand lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely\naffected.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our\nproducts and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nWe are subject to export controls, laws and regulations that restrict selling, shipping or transmitting certain of our products and services and\ntransferring certain of our technology outside the United States. These requirements also restrict domestic release of software and technology to\ncertain foreign nationals. In addition, we are subject to customs and other import requirements that regulate imports that may be important for\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations or other U.S. or non-U.S. export requirements (collectively, the Export\nRegulations), we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines to Synopsys and the possible loss of the ability to\nengage in exporting and other international transactions. Due to the nature of our business and technology, the Export Regulations may also\nsubject us to governmental inquiries regarding transactions between us and certain foreign entities. For example, we have received\nadministrative subpoenas from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (the BIS) requesting production of information and documentation\nrelating to transactions with certain Chinese entities. We have controls and procedures that are designed to achieve compliance with applicable\nExport Regulations, but we and governmental agencies have had to and may in the future review certain transactions.\nWe believe that the Export Regulations do not materially impact our business at this time, but we cannot predict the impact that additional\nregulatory changes may have on our business in the future. The United States has published significant changes to the Export Regulations with\nrespect to Russia and China, and we anticipate additional changes to the Export Regulations in the future. For example, the United States\ngovernment has implemented controls on advanced computing ICs, computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor\nmanufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor\n53\nmanufacturing end-users. The controls expand the scope of foreign-produced items subject to license requirements for certain entities on the\nU.S. government's Entity List. Future changes to the Export Regulations, including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations,\nmay create delays in the introduction of our products or services in international markets or could prevent our customers with international\noperations from deploying our products or services globally. In some cases, such changes could prevent the export or import of our products.\nConsolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small\nnumber of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results.\nA number of business combinations and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have\noccurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or\nthe loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, we depend on a\nrelatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a\nlarge portion of our revenues. Consolidation among our customers could also reduce demand for our products and services if customers\nstreamline research and development or operations, or reduce or delay purchasing decisions. Our customers operate in highly competitive\nindustries and could reduce spending on our products or services as a result of competitive pressures or other factors. Reduced customer\nspending or the loss of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, we and our competitors may acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings.\nConsolidated competitors could have considerable financial resources and channel influence as well as broad geographic reach, which may\nenable them to be more competitive in, among other things, product differentiation, breadth of technology portfolio, pricing, marketing, services\nor support. Such consolidations or acquisitions could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBusiness Operations Risks\nThe global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations.\nWe derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the United States, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on\nsales to customers outside the U.S. We have also continually expanded our non-U.S. operations. This strategy requires us to recruit and retain\nqualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects, and\nensure intellectual property protection outside of the U.S. Our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks,\nincluding, among others:\n• Economic slowdowns, recessions or uncertainty in financial markets, including, among other things, the impact of sustained\nglobal inflationary pressures and interest rates;\n• Uncertain economic, legal and political conditions in China, Europe and other regions where we do business, including, for\nexample, changes in China-Taiwan relations, regional or global military conflicts, and related sanctions and financial penalties\nimposed on participants in such conflicts;\n• Government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export controls or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade\narrangements, including the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations;\n• Ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights;\n• Difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are\nprohibited from engaging by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws; and\n• Financial risks such as longer payment cycles, changes in currency exchange rates and difficulty in collecting accounts\nreceivable.\nFurthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our\nbusiness and operating results will be harmed.\nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain Asian countries such as China, where we derive a growing\npercentage of our revenue, and the United States, that political, diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs,\ntrade embargoes, export restrictions and other trade barriers. A significant trade disruption, export restriction, or the establishment or increase of\nany trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and\n54\nservices, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a\nnegative impact on customer confidence and spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on\nour backlog, future revenue and profits and our customers’ and suppliers’ business, operating results and financial condition. For example and\nas described above, the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the U.S. and China, the unknown impact of current and future\nU.S. and Chinese trade regulations, and other geopolitical risks with respect to China and Taiwan may cause disruptions in the markets and\nindustries we serve and our supply chain, decreased demand from customers for products using our solutions or other disruptions, which could,\ndirectly or indirectly, materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For more on risks related to government export and\nimport restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and the Export Regulations see “We are subject to governmental export and import\nrequirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in\ninternational markets.”\nIn response to the U.S. adopting tariffs and trade barriers or taking other actions, other countries may also adopt tariffs and trade barriers that\ncould limit our ability to offer our products and services. Current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or\nrestrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. In\naddition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws or policies regarding technology independence may lead to non-U.S. customers\nfavoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations such as those\nrelated to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. These\nlaws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. In addition, there\nis uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. We\nmay incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to\nmake significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. If we violate these\nlaws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or\nmore countries. Any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies\nincreases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated statements of income. Likewise, a\nstrengthening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or Yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation\nand consolidation. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes\nand political and economic uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We may be unable to\nhedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our historical results should\nnot be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations.\nMany factors may cause our backlog, revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including, among other things:\n• Changes in demand for our products—especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue—due to fluctuations\nin demand for our customers’ products and due to constraints in our customers’ budgets for research and development and EDA\nproducts and services;\n• Changes in demand for our products due to customers reducing their expenditures, whether as a cost-cutting measure or a\nresult of their insolvency or bankruptcy, and whether due to sustained global inflationary pressures and interest rates and a\nprolonged global semiconductor shortage or other reasons;\n• Product competition in the EDA industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological\ninnovation;\n55\n• Our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we\nacquire;\n• Failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and\napproval process because of the complexity of our products and services;\n• Our ability to implement effective cost control measures;\n• Our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and\npurchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue;\n• Changes to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our assets or strategic\ninvestments;\n• Changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware\nproducts, may reduce our overall margins;\n• Expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technologies, including our expenses related to the Ansys\nMerger;\n• Changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions\nand tax audit settlements;\n• Delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products,\nwhich includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components;\n• Natural variability in the timing of IP drawdowns, which can be difficult to predict;\n• General economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to\ninternational trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers’ products;\nand\n• Changes in accounting standards, which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. The timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors\nthat include:\n• Cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue;\n• Delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware;\n• Delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted\nfor using the percentage of completion method;\n• Delay in the completion and delivery of IP products in development as to which customers have paid for early access;\n• Customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; and\n• The levels of our hardware and IP revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to\nprovide the latest technology and meet customer requirements.\nThese factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our backlog, revenue or earnings and cause our stock\nprice to decline. Additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may\nchange their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our stock price has been, and may continue to\nbe, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them.\nCybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could\nharm our business and our reputation.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personal information,\nin our data centers, on our networks or on the cloud. In addition, our operations depend upon our information technology (IT) systems. We\nmaintain a variety of information security policies, procedures, and controls to protect our business and proprietary information, prevent data loss\nand other security breaches and incidents, keep our IT systems operational and reduce the impact of a security breach or\n56\nincident, but these securities measures cannot provide and have not provided absolute security. In the normal course of business, our systems\nare and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have been and may be subject to compromise due to employee error,\nmalfeasance or other disruptions that have and could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. To date, we have not\nidentified material cyber security incidents or incurred any material expenses with any incidents. However, any breach or compromise could\nadversely impact our business and operations, expose us or our customers to litigation, investigations, loss of data, increase costs, or result in\nloss of customer confidence and damage to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to sell our products\nand services.\nIndustry incidences of cyberattacks and other cybersecurity breaches have increased and are likely to continue to increase. We are using an\nincreasing number of third-party software solutions, including cloud-based solutions, which increase potential threat vectors, such as by\nexploitation of misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. We also use third-party vendors that provide software or hardware, have access to our\nnetwork, and/or store sensitive data, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. Our standard vendor terms and\nconditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as\nother safeguards. Despite these measures, there is no guarantee that a compromise of our third-party vendors will not occur and in turn result in\na compromise of our own IT systems or data. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage as part of their service or product\nofferings, or if we are selected as a vendor for our cloud-based solutions, our proprietary information could be misappropriated by third parties\ndespite our attempts to validate the security of such services. Many employees continue to work remotely based on a hybrid work model, which\nmagnifies the importance of maintaining the integrity of our remote access security measures. We also periodically acquire new businesses with\nless mature security programs, and it takes time to align their security practices to meet our information security policies, procedures and\ncontrols.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems of companies such as ours change frequently and\ngenerally are not recognized until launched against a target. We may be unable to anticipate these emerging techniques, react in a timely\nmanner, or implement adequate preventative measures, or we may not have sufficient logging available to fully investigate the incident. Our\nsecurity measures vary in maturity across the business and may be and have been circumvented. For example, we have identified instances\nwhere employees have used non-approved applications for business purposes, some of which do not meet our security standards. In addition,\nwe discovered unauthorized third-party access to our products and product license files hosted on our SolvNet Plus customer license and\nproduct delivery system in 2015. Any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor’s systems could cause us to be non-compliant with\napplicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of\nconfidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to sell our products and services.\nOur software products and hosted solutions are also targeted by hackers and may be compromised by, among other things, phishing, exploits of\nour code or our system configurations, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), distributed denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated attacks\nconducted or sponsored by nation-states, advanced persistent threat intrusions, ransomware and other malware. We leverage many security\nbest practices throughout the software development lifecycle, but our security development practices vary in maturity across the business and\nmay not be effective against all cybersecurity threats. Furthermore, due to geopolitical incidents, including regional military conflicts, state-\nsupported and geopolitical-related cybersecurity incidents against companies such as ours may increase. Attacks on our products could\npotentially disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers’ work, allow unauthorized access to our or\nour customers’ proprietary information or cause other destructive outcomes.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed.\nOur success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. Our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful.\nWe rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our\nproprietary technology. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, despite our\nmeasures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are\nsuccessful. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the\nunauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be\nindependently developed by competitors.\n57\nFrom time to time, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual\nproperty; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the\npropriety rights of others.\nIf we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual\nproperty rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. In addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy,\nexpensive and uncertain. Legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transactions we complete, or find suitable target\nbusinesses and technology to acquire.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy. We have completed a significant number of acquisitions in\nrecent years and are currently anticipating the closing of the Ansys Merger in the first half of calendar year 2025. We expect to make additional\nacquisitions and strategic investments in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets, or we may not be able to\nconsummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, failure to obtain\nregulatory approvals, competitive bid dynamics or other risks, which could harm our operating results.\nAny acquisitions and strategic investments we may undertake, including the Ansys Merger, are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of\nrisks, including, but not limited to:\n• Potential negative impact on our earnings per share;\n• Failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;\n• Problems in integrating the acquired products with our products;\n• Difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions;\n• Potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased\nheadcount costs, and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products;\n• Difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees;\n• Substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt, which may be at higher than anticipated interest\nrates;\n• Failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;\n• Difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including IT and\nhuman resources systems;\n• Dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as a part of transaction consideration;\n• Difficulties in negotiating, governing and realizing value from strategic investments;\n• Assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax, litigation, cybersecurity and commercial-related risks, and the related expenses\nand diversion of resources;\n• Incurrence of costs and use of additional resources to remedy issues identified prior to or after an acquisition;\n• Disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management’s attention and uncertainty for employees and\ncustomers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process;\n• Potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners;\n• Exposure to new operational risks, regulations and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions\nwhere we are not currently conducting business;\n• The need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have\npreviously lacked such controls, processes and policies in areas such as cybersecurity, IT, privacy and more;\n• Negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investment-related costs; and\n58\n• Requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required\ndivestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business.\nIn addition, current and future changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval processes and requirements related to acquisitions, including\nthe Ansys Merger, may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated, not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may\nprevent our planned transactions or jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of such transactions, and impede the execution of our\nbusiness strategy.\nWe have also divested and may in the future divest certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies, such as the\npending Software Integrity Divestiture. Divestitures may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition if we are unable\nto achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures, or if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue\nassociated with the divested product lines or technologies. For example, if we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of certain product lines or\nassets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all. Further, whether such divestitures are\nultimately consummated or not, their pendency could have a number of negative effects on our current business, including potentially disrupting\nour regular operations, diverting the attention of our workforce and management team and increasing undesired workforce turnover. It could also\ndisrupt existing business relationships, make it harder to develop new business relationships, or otherwise negatively impact the way that we\noperate our business.\nIf we do not manage the foregoing risks, the transactions that we complete or are unable to complete, including the Ansys Merger and the\nSoftware Integrity Divestiture, may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may fail to complete the divestiture of our Software Integrity business, and a completed divestiture may disrupt our remaining\nbusiness or not achieve its intended benefits.\nOn May 5, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, by and between Synopsys, Inc. and an entity controlled by the Sponsors, pursuant to\nwhich we will sell our Software Integrity business. The Software Integrity Divestiture is anticipated to close in the second half of 2024, and a\nnumber of risks and challenges may arise in consummating the divestiture, including, among others:\n• Our or the Sponsors’ ability to obtain required regulatory approvals for the Software Integrity Divestiture and the timing and\nconditions for such approvals;\n• The failure to satisfy customary closing conditions and consummate the Software Integrity Divestiture; and\n• The occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition, the Software Integrity Divestiture could cause disruption in our remaining business, including potential adverse changes to\nrelationships with customers, employees, suppliers or other parties resulting from the divestiture process. The Software Integrity Divestiture\ncould cause customers to delay or to defer decisions with respect to our Software Integrity business or to end their relationships with us\naltogether, or otherwise limit our ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services. The Software Integrity Divestiture may also be\ndisruptive to our regular operations, diverting the attention of our workforce and management team and making the execution of business\nstrategies more difficult, and could result in increased undesired workforce turnover, including of key leaders or other personnel.\nEven if we are successful at separating and divesting our Software Integrity business, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits\nfrom the divestiture with respect to the anticipated performance of our remaining business and the divestiture may have a material adverse effect\non our business. The Software Integrity Divestiture may not enhance long-term stockholder value as anticipated, the efforts required to complete\nthe divestiture process may be more costly or time-consuming than expected, or we may not receive any or all of the Conditional Transaction\nConsideration. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our remaining business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to timely recruit and/or retain senior management and key employees globally, our business may be harmed.\n59\nWe depend in large part upon the services of our senior management team and key employees to drive our future success, and certain of such\npersonnel depart our company from time to time, with the frequency and number of such departures varying widely. For example, we have\nrecently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team due to planned succession and other departures. The departure of\nkey employees could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including, among other things, adversely affecting the timeliness of our\nproduct releases, the successful implementation and completion of our initiatives, the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting,\nand our business, operating results and financial condition.\nTo be successful, we must also attract senior management and key employees who join us organically and through acquisitions, such as the\nAnsys Merger. There are a limited number of qualified engineers. Competition for these individuals and other qualified employees is intense and\nhas increased globally, including in major markets such as Asia. Our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our\ncustomers worldwide. Any failure to recruit and/or retain senior management and key employees could harm our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition. Additionally, efforts to recruit such employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses.\nWe issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. We face pressure to limit the use of such\nequity-based compensation due to dilutive effects on stockholders. If we are unable to offer attractive compensation packages in the future, it\ncould limit our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nWe may pursue new product and technology initiatives, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, we could be adversely\nimpacted.\nAs part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products\nthrough our acquisitions and research and development efforts, such as Synopsys.ai, our AI-driven technology solution. If we are unable to\nanticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to\nintroduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business,\noperating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we have in the past and may in the future invest in efforts to expand into adjacent markets, and these efforts may not be successful.\nOur success in these markets depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• Our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience;\n• Our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements;\n• Our ability to accurately predict, prepare for and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields;\n• Our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new markets, many of which may have more financial resources,\nindustry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights or established customer relationships than we currently do;\n• Our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services; and\n• Our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields.\nDifficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets, including as a result of delays or disruptions, or\nexport control restrictions, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses\nand negatively affect our operating results.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development. New competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by\ncompetitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources\nthan we anticipate. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our\noperating results could decline. If customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their product offerings, our revenue and operating\n60\nresults may be adversely affected. Additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue,\nwhich could negatively impact our financial results. New products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. New\nsoftware products may contain undetected errors, defects or vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result\nin lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products, delays in payment by customers, loss of customers or market share, product\nreturns, damage to our reputation, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, increased\ninsurance costs and potential liability for damages. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result\nin products that create additional revenue.\nProduct errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share.\nSoftware products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated\nwith technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the\nperformance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could\nadversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of\nour IP products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license IP products from us. Any such\nerrors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose\ncustomers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks.\nThe growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including, but not limited to:\n• Increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality\nand pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver\nsufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion;\n• Increasingly variable revenue and less predictable revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is\nrecognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time;\n• Potential reductions in overall margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products, is typically lower than those of our\nsoftware products;\n• Longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which\ncan adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition;\n• Decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases or competitive products, which may lead to\nexcess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products;\n• Longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under\nwarranty, thus increasing our costs; and\n• Potential impacts on our supply chain, including the effects of sustained global inflationary pressures and interest rates, and a\nprolonged global semiconductor shortage.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. Under our\ncustomer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products are alleged to infringe\non a third party’s intellectual property rights. Infringement claims have in the past and could in the future result in costly and time-consuming\nlitigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent\nor family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments, or require us to redesign certain of our\nproducts, any one of which could harm our business and operating results.\n61\nWe may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which\nmay disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nWe license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for\ninclusion in our products. We also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our\nproducts with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. These licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed\nfrom time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. Third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their\ntechnology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. If we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and\nintellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers’ use of the products may be\ninterrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial\nresults, our customers, and our reputation.\nThe inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. We may not be\nable to sufficiently limit our potential liability contractually. Regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant\nresources and may divert management’s attention from the operation of our business.\nSome of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. Some open\nsource licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we\ncreate based on the open source software. The risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated despite our best efforts and may,\nif not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business.\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our\nconsolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived\nassets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. We also\nmake assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable\ncompensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for credit\nlosses, and legal contingencies. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors\nthat we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.\nLiquidity requirements in our U.S. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect\nour financial condition.\nWe expect that the pending Ansys Merger is likely to result in a material increase in our debt and liquidity needs that will impact our capital\nneeds. We anticipate that the funds needed to fund the cash portion of the Ansys Merger consideration and to pay related transaction fees and\nexpenses will be derived from a combination of available cash on hand and third-party debt financing. As of July 31, 2024, approximately 53% of\nour worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. We intend to fund the Ansys Merger, pay related\ntransaction fees and expenses and meet our U.S. cash spending needs primarily through our existing U.S. cash balances, ongoing U.S. cash\nflows and third-party debt financing, which will include a combination of available credit under our Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Credit\nAgreement, the Bridge Commitment and/or one or more issuances of senior unsecured notes. Our ability to obtain any such new debt financing\nwill depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We may be required to incur debt at\nhigher than anticipated interest rates, access other funding sources or repatriate cash, any of which could negatively affect our operating results,\ncapital structure or the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Ansys Merger\n62\nWe may fail to complete the Ansys Merger or may not complete it on the terms described herein or in our other filings with the SEC.\nIt is currently anticipated that we will complete the Ansys Merger in the first half of calendar year 2025. The Ansys Merger is subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the\nHSR Act, the clearance of the Ansys Merger under certain other antitrust and foreign investment regimes, and the continued effectiveness of the\nregistration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-277912) filed by us on March 14, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on April 17, 2024. As\na result, the possible timing and likelihood of completion are uncertain and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Ansys Merger will be\ncompleted on the anticipated schedule, if at all.\nAny delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when expected, if at all. If the Ansys\nMerger is not completed, we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and operating results, including,\namong other things:\n• our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an assumption that we will complete the Ansys Merger;\n• our incurrence of significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recoup;\n• under certain specified circumstances we could be required to pay Ansys a termination fee of $1.5 billion; and\n• negative publicity and other negative impacts resulting from failure to complete the Ansys Merger.\nThe Ansys Merger is subject to the receipt of governmental approvals that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect\non us or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Ansys Merger.\nCompletion of the Ansys Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of governmental approvals, including certain antitrust and foreign investment\napprovals. There can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the Ansys Merger will be\nsatisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the\nAnsys Merger or require changes to the terms of the Ansys Merger or agreements to be entered into in connection with the Ansys Merger. Such\nconditions or changes and the process of obtaining these approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding completion of the Ansys\nMerger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following completion of the Ansys Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect\non our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to realize the benefits expected from the Ansys Merger could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nThe anticipated benefits we expect from the Ansys Merger are based on projections and assumptions about our combined business with Ansys,\nwhich may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be\nadversely affected if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the Ansys Merger on a timely basis, if at all, including, among other\nthings, realizing the anticipated synergies from the Ansys Merger in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or cost\nexpectations, if at all. Achieving the benefits of the Ansys Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the business and operations of\nAnsys successfully and efficiently with our business. The challenges involved in this integration, which may be complex and time-consuming,\ninclude, among others, the following:\n• preserving customer and other important relationships of Ansys and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n• coordinating and integrating independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms\nto enhance product development while reducing costs;\n• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n• consolidating and integrating corporate, IT, finance and administrative infrastructures;\n• coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company’s capabilities and the direction of product\ndevelopment;\n• integrating Ansys’ operations and product lines;\n63\n• meeting obligations that we will have to counterparties of Ansys that arise as a result of the change in control of Ansys; and\n• integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee productivity and retaining key employees.\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, then we may not achieve\nthe anticipated benefits of the Ansys Merger on our anticipated timeframe, if at all, and our business, revenue, expenses, operating results,\nfinancial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. The successful completion of the Ansys Merger and the integration of\nthe Ansys business will require significant management attention both before and after the completion of the Ansys Merger, and may divert the\nattention of management from our normal business operations.\nAs a result of the Ansys Merger, we anticipate that the scope and size of our operations and business will substantially change and\nwill result in certain incremental risks to us, including increased competition. We may not realize the full expected benefits of the\nAnsys Merger.\nWe anticipate that the Ansys Merger will substantially expand the scope and size of our business by adding substantial assets and operations to\nour existing business. The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including,\namong other things, the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. Our senior management’s attention may be diverted\nfrom the management of our business and its daily operations to the completion of the Ansys Merger and the integration of the assets acquired\nin the Ansys Merger. Further, the Ansys Merger could also create uncertainty for our or Ansys' employees and customers, particularly during the\npost-acquisition integration process. It could also disrupt existing business relationships, make it more difficult to develop new business\nrelationships, or otherwise negatively impact the way that we operate our business.\nWe also anticipate that the Ansys Merger will result in increased competition. Ansys operates in a highly competitive industry, and is facing\nincreasing competition for its products and services, in particular in simulation and analysis. Additionally, both Ansys and Synopsys compete with\ncompanies that increasingly provide integrated EDA and simulation and analysis offerings. These competitive pressures may result in decreased\nsales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income for the combined\ncompany. These impacts could also result in our failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings as a result of the Ansys Merger. For more\non risks relating to competition in the EDA industry and other industries, see “The growth of our business depends primarily on the\nsemiconductor and electronics industries” and “We operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers’\ndemand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may not be competitive or may become obsolete.”\nOur ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls,\nreporting systems and procedures. We may also encounter risks, costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated\nliabilities and use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect. We may not be able to\nintegrate the Ansys business into our existing operations on our anticipated timelines or realize the full expected economic benefits of the Ansys\nMerger, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the completion of the Ansys Merger may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial\ncondition described elsewhere in the Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report.\nOur significant debt may limit our financial flexibility following the Ansys Merger.\nWe expect to incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the Ansys Merger and have entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter and\nthe Term Loan Agreement for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees\nand expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. We expect to use a\nportion of the proceeds from the facilities to repay Ansys’ existing credit facility substantially concurrently with the completion of the Ansys\nMerger.\nOur ability to obtain any such new debt financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our\ncontrol. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such failure could\nmaterially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our obligation to complete the Ansys Merger is not conditioned upon the\nreceipt of any financing.\n64\nFollowing the Ansys Merger, the substantial indebtedness incurred in connection with the Ansys Merger could have adverse effects on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition, including, among other things:\n• increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n• increasing our interest expense and potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to\npayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund our business needs;\n• limiting our ability to return equity through our stock repurchase program or pay dividends to our stockholders; and\n• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other\npurposes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness following the Ansys Merger will\ndepend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our\ncontrol. Our combined business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make\nnecessary capital expenditures and meet other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or\nmore alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital or debt refinancing on terms that may be\nonerous. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default\non our debt obligations which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the repayment obligations under all of our outstanding debt, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn addition, the level and quality of our earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact the determination of our\ncredit ratings by credit rating agencies. A decrease in the ratings assigned to us may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets\nand increase our cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any future required financing on acceptable terms,\nif at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current credit worthiness or prospective credit rating of the\ncombined company. Any actual or anticipated changes, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:\n• adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;\n• increase interest expense under our credit facilities;\n• increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and\n• adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.\nThe covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness following the Ansys Merger may impose restrictions on us\nand certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that will govern our indebtedness following the Ansys Merger, including any indebtedness to be incurred pursuant to the Bridge\nCommitment Letter (or any indebtedness that may refinance or replace the Bridge Commitment as set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter)\nand the Term Loan Agreement, will contain various affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants may, subject to certain significant\nexceptions, restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries after the Ansys Merger to, among other things, engage in mergers,\nconsolidations and acquisitions, grant liens and incur debt at subsidiaries. In addition, such agreements also contain financial covenants that will\nrequire us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these provisions after the Ansys Merger may be affected by events\nbeyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate\nrepayment obligations under all of our outstanding debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or\nfinancial condition.\n65\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable\ngovernment reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, or future\nchanges to our tax structure.\nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Because we have a wide range of\nstatutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from\nour intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate.\nFurthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the\ntreatment of an item of income or expense, or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits, could result in a material increase in our tax expense\nand impact our financial position and cash flows. The upcoming 2024 U.S. elections create additional uncertainty regarding the potential for new\ntax legislation that could have a material impact on future tax expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted, which significantly changed prior U.S. tax law and includes\nnumerous provisions that affect our business. The Tax Act includes certain provisions that began to affect our income in the first quarter of fiscal\n2019, while other sections of the Tax Act and related regulations began to affect our business in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. One of these\nprovisions includes the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures instead of expensing such expenditures\nas incurred. This results in a significant increase to our cash tax liability, but our effective tax rate decreases due to the foreign derived intangible\nincome deduction. Future regulatory guidance pertaining to the capitalization of research and development expenditures, including potential\nlegislation remains uncertain and may materially affect our financial position. Additionally, certain provisions of the Tax Act are set to change or\nexpire beginning in fiscal 2026, which could have a material impact on future tax expenses.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act) was enacted in the U.S. The IR Act includes a 15% minimum tax rate,\neffective in our fiscal 2024, as well as tax credit incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The details of the computation of the tax\nand implementation of the incentives will be subject to regulations to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On August 9, 2022, the\nCHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act) was enacted in the U.S. to provide certain financial incentives to the semiconductor industry,\nprimarily for manufacturing activities within the U.S. We are continuing to monitor the IR Act and CHIPS Act and related regulatory developments\nto evaluate their potential impact on our business and operating results.\nOn October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on\nBase Erosion and Profit Shifting (Framework) which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the\neconomy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules (Pillar Two) defining the global minimum tax rules, which\ncontemplate a 15% minimum tax rate. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including Administrative Guidance on how the Pillar\nTwo rules should be interpreted and applied and many countries are passing legislation to comply with Pillar Two. The Framework calls for law\nenactment by OECD and G20 members to take effect in 2024 and 2025. These changes, when enacted by various countries in which we do\nbusiness, may increase our taxes in these countries. Various countries have started to enact new laws related to Pillar Two, including certain\nnew laws effective beginning in our fiscal year 2025. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future\nactions taken by foreign governments, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nOur income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing\nauthorities. We exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our\nbusiness, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may also be liable for potential tax\nliabilities of businesses we acquire. The final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical\nincome tax provisions and accruals. An assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and\nnet income in the periods for which that determination is made. For further discussion on our ongoing audits, see Note 20. Income Taxes of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report under the heading \"Non-U.S. Examinations.\"\nWe maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits and capitalized research and development expenditures. Our ability to\nuse these deferred tax assets is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax\ncredits, how such credits are treated under current and\n66\npotential future tax law. Changes to tax laws and regulations, and changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the\ndeferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect\nto environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including, among\nothers, the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These rules and regulations continue to\nevolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance\ndifficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations\nhave resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and\nattention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG initiatives, and\ncollecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting\nstandards, including the SEC’s climate-related reporting requirements, the recently enacted California climate-related disclosure laws, and the\nEuropean Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental\nmatters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments and other ESG matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These\ninitiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and\nmay not advance at a sufficient pace, and ensuring the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives can be\ncostly, difficult and time consuming. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on\nstandards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are\nsubject to change. We could also face scrutiny from certain stakeholders for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions\nto these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to\nour ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) could adversely affect our financial results and may require\nsignificant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the\nSEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The FASB periodically issues new\naccounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. These and other such\nstandards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our\nfinancial results.\nWe may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition and other\nissues on a global basis. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include\nmonetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more\nproducts. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and operating results could be materially harmed. Further\ninformation regarding certain of these matters is contained in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this Quarterly Report.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs.\nRegardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Our compliance programs and compliance training for employees may not\nprevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or\n67\nviolating applicable laws and regulations. Failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business.\nGeneral Risks\nOur investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets.\nFrom time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade U.S. government agency securities,\nasset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other\nsecurities and bank deposits. Our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by\ndeteriorating economic conditions, sustained global inflationary pressures and interest rates and bank failures. Fixed rate debt securities may\nhave their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less\nincome than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs.\nOur future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by\nus is judged to be other-than-temporary. In addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market\nvalue due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates.\nCatastrophic events and the effects of climate change, pandemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our business and harm our\noperating results.\nDue to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events and the effects of climate\nchange, pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, or other unexpected events throughout the world. We rely on a global network of\ninfrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales\nactivities. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, extreme temperatures, drought, flood,\ntelecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic or pandemic, or other catastrophic or climate change-related events\ncould cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’\norders. In particular, our sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions, including the effects of the outbreak of\ncontagious diseases, such as the government-imposed restrictions that curtailed global economic activity and caused substantial volatility in\nglobal financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in California, near major earthquake faults and\nsites of recent wildfires, which may become more frequent, along with other extreme weather events, due to climate change. A catastrophic\nevent or other extreme weather event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or IT systems would\nseverely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected.\n68\nItem 2.

SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING METRICS\n(1) All metrics except for Outstanding Debt and Operating Cash Flow presented on a continuing operations basis.\n(2) Amounts may not foot due to rounding.\n(3) Includes maintenance on term and perpetual licenses.\n(4) We define recurring revenue as revenue generated from time-based products, multi-period IP contracts, and maintenance and\nservices, for which revenue is recognized over time.\n(5) Should be read in conjunction with our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 21,\n2024 and the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, among other things, non-GAAP operating\nmargin to their most closely applicable GAAP measures found in this Supplement.\n(6) Typically tracks earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over time (less cash taxes). It is important to\nconsider multi-year averages, as operating cash flow is inherently lumpy.\n(7) We manage the business on a long-term, annual basis and consider quarterly fluctuations of revenue and profitability as a\nnormal element of our business.\n(8) These segments results are presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, Segment Reporting.\nSynopsys’ chief operating decision maker (CODM) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM does not allocate certain\noperating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments and, as a result, the reported operating\nincome and operating margin do not include these unallocated expenses as shown in the table above.

NOTICE TO INVESTORS\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nPlease see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 21, 2024 available at http://www.sec.gov for\nthe reasons why Synopsys believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful\ninformation to our stockholders regarding our financial condition and results of operations and the purposes for which\nmanagement uses such non-GAAP financial measures. Certain non-GAAP data used by management, as well as the\nreconciliation of such data to its most closely applicable GAAP measures, is contained in the third quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024 earnings release available on Synopsys’ website at https://investor.synopsys.com/news/default.aspx and\nour Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 21, 2024. Synopsys is unable to provide a\nreconciliation of its long-term, multi-year target for annual non-GAAP EPS growth and certain fourth quarter and full\nfiscal year 2024 non-GAAP financial targets to the corresponding GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking\nbasis because Synopsys believes that it would not be possible for it to have the required information necessary to\nquantitatively reconcile such measures with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts due to, among other\nthings, the potential variability and limited predictability of the excluded adjustment items necessary for a full\nreconciliation such as certain acquisition/divestiture related items, restructuring charges, tax deduction variability,\nchanges in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan, and gains (losses) on the sale of strategic\ninvestments. For the same reasons, Synopsys is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable\ninformation.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained herein and in our investor conference call contain forward-looking statements,\nincluding, but not limited to, statements regarding short-term and long-term financial targets, expectations and\nobjectives including, among others, our long-term financial objectives, which include the anticipated effects of our\npending acquisition of ANSYS, Inc.
