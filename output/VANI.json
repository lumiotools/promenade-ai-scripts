(NASDAQ: [VANI](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vani)) (the “Company” or “Vivani”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company developing miniaturized, ultra long-acting drug implants, announced today that CEO Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., will present and participate in a panel discussion at the Innovation in Obesity Therapeutics Summit West Coast, taking place in San Diego, California, from December 10-12, 2024. \n\nEvent details are as follows: \n\n**Panel Discussion: The Obesity Race on the Manufacturing Floor – Exploring Supply Challenges with Innovations in Discovery** Panel Date: Wednesday, December 11, 2024 Panel Time: 2:40 pm, Pacific Time \n\nDr. Mendelsohn will be joined by Feng Liu, Executive Director at Regor Therapeutics, and David Bearss, co-founder and Chairman at Biolexis Therapeutics, in a panel discussion of supply chain challenges for GLP-1 drugs and the innovative solutions that are being explored to address these issues. \n\n**Presentation: Advancing Chronic Disease Management with Ultra Long-Acting Miniature Subdermal Implants of GLP-1** Presentation Date: Wednesday, December 11, 2024 Presentation Time: 4:20pm, Pacific Time \n\nIn this session, Dr. Mendelsohn will provide an overview of Vivani’s emerging portfolio of miniature, drug implant candidates designed to revolutionize the treatment of chronic diseases by leveraging the company’s proprietary NanoPortal™ implant technology. The Company’s lead program, NPM-119, is a six-month GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in development for chronic weight management. Clinical data from LIBERATE-1, the first-in-human, study in obese and overweight individuals, is expected in 2025. These ultra long-acting implants are designed for once or twice-yearly dosing and directly address main [major] challenges to optimal treatment, including poor medication adherence and potentially poor patient tolerability. \n\nMore information about Innovation in Obesity Therapeutics Summit West Coast can be found at <https://innovation-obesity-summit.com/>. \n\n**About Vivani Medical, Inc.**\n\nLeveraging its proprietary NanoPortal™ platform, Vivani develops biopharmaceutical implants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the goal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their medication. Vivani’s lead program, NPM-115, utilizes a miniature, six-month, subdermal, GLP-1 (exenatide) implant under development for chronic weight management in obese or overweight individuals. Vivani’s emerging pipeline also includes the NPM-139 (semaglutide implant) which is also under development for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The semaglutide implant has the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration. NPM-119 refers to the Company’s type 2 diabetes development program utilizing a six-month, subdermal exenatide implant. Both the NPM-115 and NPM-119 programs utilize exenatide-based products with a higher-dose associated with the NPM-115 program for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients. These NanoPortal™ implants are designed to provide patients with the opportunity to realize the full potential benefit of their medication by avoiding the challenges associated with the daily or weekly administration of orals and injectables. Medication non-adherence occurs when patients do not take their medication as prescribed. This affects an alarming number of patients, approximately 50%, including those taking daily pills. Medication non-adherence, which contributes to more than $500 billion in annual avoidable healthcare costs and 125,000 potentially preventable deaths annually in the U.S. alone, is a primary and daunting reason obese or overweight patients, and patients taking type 2 diabetes or other chronic disease treatments face significant challenges in achieving positive real-world effectiveness. While the current GLP-1 landscape includes over 50 new molecular entities under clinical stage development, Vivani remains confident that its highly differentiated portfolio of miniature long-acting GLP-1 implants have the potential to provide an attractive therapeutic option for patients, prescribers and payers. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: VANI) (“Vivani” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company developing miniaturized, long-acting drug implants, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update. \n\nVivani’s Chief Executive Officer Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., stated, “We made significant progress advancing our proprietary GLP-1 implants for obesity and chronic weight management in the third quarter, and we anticipate the initiation of our first-in-human clinical study, named LIBERATE-1, in the fourth quarter of this year. After choosing to conduct our initial first-in-human study in Australia, in part to take advantage of potentially significant rebates from the Australian government, we were excited to receive the regulatory approvals to initiate LIBERATE-1, as a key element of our NPM-115 clinical program in overweight and obese individuals. Today’s $5 million common stock financing announcement puts us in an excellent position to complete LIBERATE-1 and continue development of our pipeline programs in 2025.” \n\nDr. Mendelsohn added, “Our NanoPortal drug delivery technology has the potential to directly address medication non-adherence which is responsible for approximately 125,000 avoidable deaths each year in the US alone, more than caused by breast, colorectal and liver cancer combined. In addition, approximately 50% of patients with chronic diseases, including patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, do not take their medicine as prescribed in the real world, a statistic which holds for both daily orals as well as weekly injectables. GLP-1 drugs have already improved the health of millions of people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the future potential impact of these medicines to improve global health across a variety of new indications is even more remarkable. At Vivani, we are addressing the tremendous opportunity to revolutionize the treatment of chronic diseases, including obesity, with our emerging pipeline of miniature, ultra long-acting drug implants specifically designed to ensure medication adherence with twice-yearly, and potentially once-yearly, administration that will allow patients to achieve the full potential benefits of their medicine.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\nIn July 2024, the Company announced that it expects to initiate the first clinical study in the NPM-115 program in the fourth quarter of 2024 in Australia, pending regulatory clearance in that country. The NPM-115 clinical program will evaluate the investigational 6-month GLP-1 implant for chronic weight management in patients who are either obese or overweight with a related comorbidity. \n\nIn September 2024, the Company announced that the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee approved, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia formally acknowledged a first-in-human clinical trial of the Company’s miniature, subdermal GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight subjects. \n\nAlso in September 2024, the Company reported that its exenatide implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat reduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. The Company previously announced sham-implant adjusted preclinical weight loss of 20%, which is comparable to the weight loss produced from the semaglutide (active ingredient in Ozempic®/Wegovy®) injection control arm in the same study. \n\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share. The gross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5.0 million which secures Vivani’s financial position into late 2025 and supports projected completion of the first-in-human study and data read-out. \n\n**Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Vivani plans to initiate LIBERATE-1, a Phase 1, first-in-human study of a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 (exenatide) implant to investigate the safety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile in obese or overweight subjects. The trial will enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. Data is projected to be available in 2025. \n  * Vivani will present at the Innovation in Obesity Therapeutics Summit – West Coast on December 10-12, 2024, in San Diego, CA. \n\n\n\nOzempic® and Wegovy® are registered trademarks of Novo Nordisk A/S. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash balance** : As of September 30, 2024, Vivani had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $21.0 million, compared to $26.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease of $5.3 million is attributed to a net loss of $6.0 million, a decrease of $0.3 million changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $0.6 million in non-cash items for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation and lease expense, and a net cash of $0.4 million provided by financing activities. \n\n**Research and development expense** : Research and development expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million, or 5%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business and reduced use of outside services, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expenses. \n\n**General and administrative expense** : General and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, compared to $2.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 22%, was attributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business along with reduced outside legal and other professional services. \n\n**Other income, net** : Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was not significant. \n\n**Net Loss** : The net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.0 million, compared to $6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $0.8 million. \n\n**About Vivani Medical, Inc.**\n\nLeveraging its proprietary NanoPortalTM platform, Vivani develops biopharmaceutical implants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the goal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their medication.

Vivani’s lead program, NPM-115, utilizes a miniature, six-month, subdermal, GLP-1 (exenatide) implant under development for chronic weight management in obese or overweight individuals. Vivani’s emerging pipeline also includes the NPM-139 (semaglutide) implant which is also under development for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The semaglutide implant has the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration. NPM-119 refers to the Company’s Type 2 Diabetes development program utilizing a six-month, subdermal exenatide implant. Both the NPM-115 and NPM-119 programs utilize exenatide based products with a higher-dose associated with the NPM-115 program for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients. These NanoPortal implants are designed to provide patients with the opportunity to realize the full potential benefit of their medication by avoiding the challenges associated with the daily or weekly administration of orals and injectables. Medication non-adherence occurs when patients do not take their medication as prescribed. This affects an alarming number of patients, approximately 50%, including those taking daily pills. Medication non-adherence, which contributes to more than $500 billion in annual avoidable healthcare costs and 125,000 potentially preventable deaths annually in the U.S. alone, is a primary and daunting reason obese or overweight patients, and patients taking type 2 diabetes or other chronic disease treatments, face significant challenges in achieving positive real-world effectiveness. While the current GLP-1 landscape includes over 50 new molecular entities under clinical stage development, Vivani remains confident that its highly differentiated portfolio of miniature long-acting GLP-1 implants have the potential to provide an attractive therapeutic option for patients, prescribers and payers. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “would,” “positioned,” “future,” and other similar expressions that in this press release, including statements regarding Vivani’s business, products in development, including the therapeutic potential thereof, the planned development therefor, the initiation of the LIBERATE-1 trial and reporting of trial results, Vivani’s emerging development plans for NPM-115, NPM-139, or Vivani’s plans with respect to Vivani’s technology, strategy, cash position and financial runway.

(Nasdaq: VANI) (“Vivani” or the “Company”), an innovative, biopharmaceutical company developing novel, ultra long-acting drug implants, today announced that the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee (“HREC”) has approved and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) in Australia has formally acknowledged a first in human clinical trial of the Company’s miniature, subdermal GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight subjects. This clinical trial, known as LIBERATE-1™, will investigate the safety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile of an exenatide implant and represents the first clinical application of the Company’s proprietary NanoPortal™ drug implant technology. \n\n“Securing regulatory approval keeps us on schedule to initiate this trial in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2024,” said Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., Vivani President and Chief Executive Officer. “Preclinical weight loss and liver fat data announced earlier this year supports the potential for our GLP-1 implant to provide comparable efficacy to semaglutide, the active ingredient in blockbuster products Ozempic® and Wegovy®, but with the significant benefit of twice-yearly administration. We remain confident that our emerging portfolio of miniature, ultra long-acting, GLP-1 implants has the potential to be highly differentiated from the injectable and oral products in the market and in development. Specifically, our implants are uniquely designed to address medication non-adherence, a critical challenge for many patients which we believe represents the largest opportunity to improve real world health outcomes for patients, and the steady delivery of medicine enabled by our NanoPortal technology may also improve treatment tolerability.” \n\nLIBERATE-1 will be a randomized investigation of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of the exenatide NanoPortal implant in obese or overweight subjects. The trial will enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. The trial is expected to be initiated later this year with data projected to be available in 2025. \n\nIf available, Vivani intends to utilize research and development incentives and rebates from the Australian government in order to defray a portion of the costs from the trial. Since clinical studies conducted in Australia comply with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and data generated in Australia generally are acceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities, Vivani anticipates use of relevant clinical data generated in Australia to support regulatory submissions in other geographies including the United States. Additional guidance regarding future regulatory submissions will be provided as new information becomes available. \n\nOzempic® and Wegovy® are registered trademarks of Novo Nordisk A/S. \n\n**About Vivani Medical, Inc.**\n\nLeveraging its proprietary NanoPortal™ platform, Vivani develops biopharmaceutical implants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the goal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their medication.

(Nasdaq: VANI) (“Vivani” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company developing miniaturized, long-acting drug implants, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update. \n\nVivani’s Chief Executive Officer Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., stated, “We made significant progress advancing our proprietary GLP-1 implants for obesity and chronic weight management in the third quarter, and we anticipate the initiation of our first-in-human clinical study, named LIBERATE-1, in the fourth quarter of this year. After choosing to conduct our initial first-in-human study in Australia, in part to take advantage of potentially significant rebates from the Australian government, we were excited to receive the regulatory approvals to initiate LIBERATE-1, as a key element of our NPM-115 clinical program in overweight and obese individuals. Today’s $5 million common stock financing announcement puts us in an excellent position to complete LIBERATE-1 and continue development of our pipeline programs in 2025.” \n\nDr. Mendelsohn added, “Our NanoPortal drug delivery technology has the potential to directly address medication non-adherence which is responsible for approximately 125,000 avoidable deaths each year in the US alone, more than caused by breast, colorectal and liver cancer combined. In addition, approximately 50% of patients with chronic diseases, including patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, do not take their medicine as prescribed in the real world, a statistic which holds for both daily orals as well as weekly injectables. GLP-1 drugs have already improved the health of millions of people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the future potential impact of these medicines to improve global health across a variety of new indications is even more remarkable. At Vivani, we are addressing the tremendous opportunity to revolutionize the treatment of chronic diseases, including obesity, with our emerging pipeline of miniature, ultra long-acting drug implants specifically designed to ensure medication adherence with twice-yearly, and potentially once-yearly, administration that will allow patients to achieve the full potential benefits of their medicine.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\nIn July 2024, the Company announced that it expects to initiate the first clinical study in the NPM-115 program in the fourth quarter of 2024 in Australia, pending regulatory clearance in that country. The NPM-115 clinical program will evaluate the investigational 6-month GLP-1 implant for chronic weight management in patients who are either obese or overweight with a related comorbidity. \n\nIn September 2024, the Company announced that the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee approved, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia formally acknowledged a first-in-human clinical trial of the Company’s miniature, subdermal GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight subjects. \n\nAlso in September 2024, the Company reported that its exenatide implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat reduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. The Company previously announced sham-implant adjusted preclinical weight loss of 20%, which is comparable to the weight loss produced from the semaglutide (active ingredient in Ozempic®/Wegovy®) injection control arm in the same study. \n\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share. The gross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5.0 million which secures Vivani’s financial position into late 2025 and supports projected completion of the first-in-human study and data read-out. \n\n**Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Vivani plans to initiate LIBERATE-1, a Phase 1, first-in-human study of a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 (exenatide) implant to investigate the safety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile in obese or overweight subjects. The trial will enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. Data is projected to be available in 2025. \n  * Vivani will present at the Innovation in Obesity Therapeutics Summit – West Coast on December 10-12, 2024, in San Diego, CA. \n\n\n\nOzempic® and Wegovy® are registered trademarks of Novo Nordisk A/S. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash balance** : As of September 30, 2024, Vivani had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $21.0 million, compared to $26.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease of $5.3 million is attributed to a net loss of $6.0 million, a decrease of $0.3 million changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $0.6 million in non-cash items for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation and lease expense, and a net cash of $0.4 million provided by financing activities. \n\n**Research and development expense** : Research and development expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million, or 5%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business and reduced use of outside services, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expenses. \n\n**General and administrative expense** : General and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, compared to $2.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 22%, was attributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business along with reduced outside legal and other professional services. \n\n**Other income, net** : Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was not significant. \n\n**Net Loss** : The net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.0 million, compared to $6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $0.8 million. \n\n**About Vivani Medical, Inc.**\n\nLeveraging its proprietary NanoPortalTM platform, Vivani develops biopharmaceutical implants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the goal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their medication. Vivani’s lead program, NPM-115, utilizes a miniature, six-month, subdermal, GLP-1 (exenatide) implant under development for chronic weight management in obese or overweight individuals. Vivani’s emerging pipeline also includes the NPM-139 (semaglutide implant) which is also under development for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The semaglutide implant has the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration. NPM-119 refers to the Company’s type 2 diabetes development program utilizing a six-month, subdermal exenatide implant. Both the NPM-115 and NPM-119 programs utilize exenatide based products with a higher-dose associated with the NPM-115 program for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients. These NanoPortal implants are designed to provide patients with the opportunity to realize the full potential benefit of their medication by avoiding the challenges associated with the daily or weekly administration of orals and injectables. Medication non-adherence occurs when patients do not take their medication as prescribed. This affects an alarming number of patients, approximately 50%, including those taking daily pills. Medication non-adherence, which contributes to more than $500 billion in annual avoidable healthcare costs and 125,000 potentially preventable deaths annually in the U.S. alone, is a primary and daunting reason obese or overweight patients, and patients taking type 2 diabetes or other chronic disease treatments face significant challenges in achieving positive real-world effectiveness. While the current GLP-1 landscape includes over 50 new molecular entities under clinical stage development, Vivani remains confident that its highly differentiated portfolio of miniature long-acting GLP-1 implants have the potential to provide an attractive therapeutic option for patients, prescribers and payers. \n\n**About Cortigent, Inc.**\n\nVivani’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), is developing precision neurostimulation systems intended to help patients recover critical body functions. Investigational devices include Orion®, designed to provide artificial vision to people who are profoundly blind, and a new system intended to accelerate the recovery of arm and hand function in patients who are partially paralyzed due to stroke. Cortigent has developed, manufactured, and marketed an implantable visual prosthetic device, Argus II®, that delivered meaningful visual perception to blind individuals. Vivani continues to assess strategic options for advancing Cortigent’s pioneering technology. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: VANI) (“Vivani” or the\n“Company”), a biopharmaceutical company developing miniaturized, long-acting drug\nimplants, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nand provided a business update.\nVivani’s Chief Executive Officer Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., stated, “We made significant\nprogress advancing our proprietary GLP-1 implants for obesity and chronic weight\nmanagement in the third quarter, and we anticipate the initiation of our first-in-human clinical\nstudy, named LIBERATE-1, in the fourth quarter of this year. After choosing to conduct our\ninitial first-in-human study in Australia, in part to take advantage of potentially significant\nrebates from the Australian government, we were excited to receive the regulatory approvals\nto initiate LIBERATE-1, as a key element of our NPM-115 clinical program in overweight and\nobese individuals. Today’s $5 million common stock financing announcement puts us in an\nexcellent position to complete LIBERATE-1 and continue development of our pipeline\nprograms in 2025.”\nDr. Mendelsohn added, “Our NanoPortal drug delivery technology has the potential to\ndirectly address medication non-adherence which is responsible for approximately 125,000\navoidable deaths each year in the US alone, more than caused by breast, colorectal and\nliver cancer combined. In addition, approximately 50% of patients with chronic diseases,\nincluding patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, do not take their medicine as prescribed\nin the real world, a statistic which holds for both daily orals as well as weekly injectables.\nGLP-1 drugs have already improved the health of millions of people with obesity and type 2\ndiabetes, but the future potential impact of these medicines to improve global health across\na variety of new indications is even more remarkable. At Vivani, we are addressing the\ntremendous opportunity to revolutionize the treatment of chronic diseases, including obesity,\nwith our emerging pipeline of miniature, ultra long-acting drug implants specifically designed\nto ensure medication adherence with twice-yearly, and potentially once-yearly, administration\nthat will allow patients to achieve the full potential benefits of their medicine.”\nRecent Business Highlights\nIn July 2024, the Company announced that it expects to initiate the first clinical study in the\nNPM-115 program in the fourth quarter of 2024 in Australia, pending regulatory clearance in\nthat country. The NPM-115 clinical program will evaluate the investigational 6-month GLP-1\nimplant for chronic weight management in patients who are either obese or overweight with\na related comorbidity.\nIn September 2024, the Company announced that the Bellberry Human Research Ethics\nCommittee approved, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia formally\nacknowledged a first-in-human clinical trial of the Company’s miniature, subdermal GLP-1\n(exenatide) implant in obese and overweight subjects.\nAlso in September 2024, the Company reported that its exenatide implant produced sham-\nimplant adjusted liver fat reduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single\nadministration with expected twice-yearly dosing. The Company previously announced\nsham-implant adjusted preclinical weight loss of 20%, which is comparable to the weight\nloss produced from the semaglutide (active ingredient in Ozempic®/Wegovy®) injection\ncontrol arm in the same study.\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its\nindependent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share. The gross proceeds\nfrom this private sale transaction were $5.0 million which secures Vivani’s financial position\ninto late 2025 and supports projected completion of the first-in-human study and data read-\nout.\nUpcoming Anticipated Milestones\nVivani plans to initiate LIBERATE-1, a Phase 1, first-in-human study of a miniature,\nultra long-acting GLP-1 (exenatide) implant to investigate the safety, tolerability and full\npharmacokinetic profile in obese or overweight subjects. The trial will enroll\nparticipants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25\nmg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized\nto receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide\ninjections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment\nduration. Changes in weight will be measured. Data is projected to be available in\n2025.\nVivani will present at the Innovation in Obesity Therapeutics Summit – West Coast on\nDecember 10-12, 2024, in San Diego, CA.\nOzempic® and Wegovy® are registered trademarks of Novo Nordisk A/S.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nCash balance: As of September 30, 2024, Vivani had cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash totaling $21.0 million, compared to $26.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease of\n$5.3 million is attributed to a net loss of $6.0 million, a decrease of $0.3 million changes in\noperating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $0.6 million in non-cash items for\ndepreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation and\nlease expense, and a net cash of $0.4 million provided by financing activities.\nResearch and development expense: Research and development expense during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, compared to $4.4 million during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million, or 5%, was\nprimarily attributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business and reduced\nuse of outside services, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense: General and administrative expense during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, compared to $2.7 million during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 22%, was\nattributable to staffing reduction in Vivani’s neurostimulation business along with reduced\noutside legal and other professional services.\nOther income, net: Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024\nwas $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The change was not significant.\nNet Loss: The net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.0\nmillion, compared to $6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in net loss of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating\nexpenses of $0.8 million.\nAbout Vivani Medical, Inc.\nLeveraging its proprietary NanoPortalTM platform, Vivani develops biopharmaceutical\nimplants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the\ngoal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their\nmedication. Vivani’s lead program, NPM-115, utilizes a miniature, six-month, subdermal,\nGLP-1 (exenatide) implant under development for chronic weight management in obese or\noverweight individuals. Vivani’s emerging pipeline also includes the NPM-139 (semaglutide\nimplant) which is also under development for chronic weight management in obese and\noverweight individuals. The semaglutide implant has the added potential benefit of once-\nyearly administration. NPM-119 refers to the Company’s type 2 diabetes development\nprogram utilizing a six-month, subdermal exenatide implant. Both the NPM-115 and NPM-\n119 programs utilize exenatide based products with a higher-dose associated with the NPM-\n115 program for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients. These\nNanoPortal implants are designed to provide patients with the opportunity to realize the full\npotential benefit of their medication by avoiding the challenges associated with the daily or\nweekly administration of orals and injectables. Medication non-adherence occurs when\npatients do not take their medication as prescribed. This affects an alarming number of\npatients, approximately 50%, including those taking daily pills. Medication non-adherence,\nwhich contributes to more than $500 billion in annual avoidable healthcare costs and\n125,000 potentially preventable deaths annually in the U.S. alone, is a primary and daunting\nreason obese or overweight patients, and patients taking type 2 diabetes or other chronic\ndisease treatments face significant challenges in achieving positive real-world effectiveness.\nWhile the current GLP-1 landscape includes over 50 new molecular entities under clinical\nstage development, Vivani remains confident that its highly differentiated portfolio of\nminiature long-acting GLP-1 implants have the potential to provide an attractive therapeutic\noption for patients, prescribers and payers.\nAbout Cortigent, Inc.\nVivani’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), is developing precision\nneurostimulation systems intended to help patients recover critical body functions.\nInvestigational devices include Orion®, designed to provide artificial vision to people who are\nprofoundly blind, and a new system intended to accelerate the recovery of arm and hand\nfunction in patients who are partially paralyzed due to stroke. Cortigent has developed,\nmanufactured, and marketed an implantable visual prosthetic device, Argus II®, that\ndelivered meaningful visual perception to blind individuals. Vivani continues to assess\nstrategic options for advancing Cortigent’s pioneering technology.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the\n“safe harbor” provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Organization and Business Operations**\n\nVivani Medical, Inc. (“Vivani,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) is a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company which develops miniaturized, subdermal implants utilizing its proprietary NanoPortal™ technology, which is designed to enable long-term, near constant-rate delivery of a broad range of medicines to treat chronic diseases. Vivani uses this platform technology to develop and potentially commercialize drug implant candidates, alone or in collaboration with pharmaceutical company partners to address a leading cause of poor clinical outcomes in the treatment of chronic disease, medication non-adherence. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adherence is defined as the extent to which an individual’s behavior, including taking medications, corresponds to recommendations from a health care provider. An alarmingly high proportion of patients, approximately 50%, do not take their medicine as prescribed in the real world, a statistic that applies to both daily oral as well as weekly injectable medicines. For example, a recent study has shown that 64% of patients taking Wegovy® (semaglutide injectable) discontinue therapy within the first year of treatment, a number that increases to 76% by the second year. Unfortunately, GLP-1 discontinuation may result in a quick reversal of the health benefits in the majority of patients. \n\nAt Vivani, we are developing a portfolio of miniature, subdermal drug implant candidates that, unlike most oral and injectable medicines, are designed with the goal of guaranteeing medication adherence by delivering therapeutic drug levels for up to six months or longer. In addition, our aim is to minimize fluctuations in patients’ drug levels through the use of our NanoPortal™ technology, which may improve the tolerability profiles for medicines, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, that produce side effects associated with fluctuating drug levels in the blood.\n\nVivani resulted from the business combination of Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (“Second Sight”) and Nano Precision Medical, Inc. (“NPM”). On August 30, 2022, Second Sight and NPM completed their merger pursuant to which NPM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Second Sight and the combined company of NPM and Second Sight was renamed Vivani Medical, Inc. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of its lead program NPM-115, a miniature, 6-month, GLP-1 implant candidate for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients with one or more risk factors and further development of the balance of company’s miniature, long-acting drug implant portfolio. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remains committed to identifying and exploring strategic options that will enable further development of its pioneering neurostimulation systems from legacy company Second Sight aimed at helping patients recover critical body functions.\n\nIn December 2022, we contributed our neurostimulation assets and certain liabilities to Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivani. Cortigent has 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, all owned by Vivani. Cortigent is advancing the Company’s pioneering neurostimulation technology. In March 2023, Vivani announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the proposed initial public offering of Cortigent. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 was recently amended and filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024 to refresh the financial information and provide minor updates to the business.\n\nOn July 6, 2023, Vivani changed its state of incorporation from the State of California to the State of Delaware by means of a plan of conversion, effective July 5, 2023. The reincorporation, including the principal terms of the plan of conversion, was submitted to a vote of, and approved by, Vivani’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 15, 2023. As part of this change of incorporation the Company established a par value of $0.0001 per share and all periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change.\n\nAn Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for NPM-119 (GLP-1 implant) was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on July 14, 2023, to support the initiation of a first-in-human study of an exenatide implant in patients with type 2 diabetes. On August 18, 2023, FDA provided written notification that the study was on full clinical hold, primarily due to insufficient Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information to assess the risk to human subjects. After providing additional information to sufficiently address the FDA's requests, the FDA lifted the clinical hold on NPM-119 on June 13, 2024 allowing for the proposed study to proceed. The primary objective of this first-in-human clinical study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 in type 2 diabetes patients. The initial study design also incorporated Bydureon BCise® (exenatide injection) for comparison purposes.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nOn August 25, 2023, the Company and Cortigent entered into an Amendment 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Transition Funding, Support and Services Agreement dated March 19, 2023 (the “TFSSA”). Pursuant to the TFSSA, Vivani has agreed to advance funds and provide or cause to be provided to Cortigent the services and funding intended to cover salaries and related costs, rent and other overhead in order to permit Cortigent to operate in substantially the same manner in which business operations of Cortigent were previously operated by Second Sight, prior to the formation of Cortigent, which obligations will continue, in the case of the funding obligations, until the earlier of December 31, 2024 or the closing of an initial public offering of Cortigent (the “Funding Support Term”). Under the Amendment, Cortigent has agreed to repay $1,500,000 to Vivani at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term. In addition, at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term, Cortigent will enter into a five-year promissory note at 5% interest for $2,000,000 in favor of Vivani. Consequently, Vivani will forgive any remaining amounts due by Cortigent to the Company under the TFSSA. In October 2023, Vivani implemented a reduction-in-force to conserve cash that decreased Cortigent’s employees from 14 to 7 while continuing the ongoing Orion® clinical study and basic operations.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia was established to support studies of our product candidates.\n\nIn February 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical weight loss data with its exenatide implant that was comparable to semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic®/Wegovy®, and a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio. In a study of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, the exenatide implant generated weight loss of approximately 20% compared to a sham implant control after a 28-day treatment duration, comparable to the extent of weight loss observed in mice treated with semaglutide injections (Ozempic®) in the same study.\n\nIn February, the Company also disclosed that semaglutide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NPM-139, another miniature, long term subdermal GLP-1 implant in development for chronic weight management further demonstrating our prioritization on obesity. NPM-139 also has the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (“Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor to purchase 3,947,368 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrant in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire three years following the date of issuance.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, Vivani announced the publication of positive weight loss data supporting the potential veterinary use of OKV-119, the company's miniature, long-acting GLP-1 implant under development with partner Okava Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Okava\") for the treatment of pre-diabetes, diabetes and obesity in companion felines. The device is intended to be conveniently inserted under the skin during routine veterinary visits and is being designed to deliver six months of GLP-1 therapy with a single administration. \n\nAs stated previously, on June 13, 2024, Vivani announced that the FDA cleared the IND and lifted the clinical hold for NPM-119, the Company's miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant under development for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company provided an update of the clinical development plans for NPM-115, the clinical program associated with the miniature, long-acting GLP-1 (high-dose exenatide) implant for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The Company has redesigned the First-in-Human study, LIBERATE-1, initially intended to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of its exenatide implant in patients with type 2 diabetes, to evaluate the implant in obese and overweight patients. The study will enroll patients who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for eight weeks before being randomized to receive a single exenatide implant, weekly exenatide injections (Bydureon BCise®) or weekly semaglutide injections (Wegovy®) for a nine-week treatment duration. The LIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia and is anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory clearance, with data from the study expected in 2025.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical liver fat results with its miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 implant currently under development chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals and type 2 diabetes. The Company's GLP-1 (exenatide) implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat reduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. These liver fat data are consistent with published results from similar investigations with semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic® and Wegovy®.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\nOn September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to initiate its first in human clinical trial with a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. This clinical trial, known as LIBERATE-1™, is part of the NPM-115 program and will investigate the safety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile of an exenatide implant. The trial also represents the first clinical application of the Company’s proprietary NanoPortal™ drug implant technology. LIBERATE-1 is designed to enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. The trial is expected to be initiated later this year with data projected to be available in 2025.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock and warrants.\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no revenue that is developing novel medical devices, including limitations on our operating capital resources. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock (the “Warrants”), to such investor at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in the Offering. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. Simultaneously, the Company also entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and such agreement, the “Placement Agency Agreement,” and together with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the “Agreements”), who acted as the sole placement agent for the Offering. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to develop profitable operations through implementation of our business initiatives and/or raise additional capital, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\n\n**Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThese unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and following the requirements of the SEC for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by GAAP can be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows for periods presented. These statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. The results of the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or any other interim period or any future year or period.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n_Use of estimates_\n\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to useful lives of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and evaluation of going concern. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\n_Operating Segments_\n\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker, our Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented for each of our segments. We have two reporting segments, specifically the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division. Neither division is revenue producing. The Biopharm Division includes activities from NPM and Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd. The Neurostimulation Division includes activities from Cortigent and our subsidiary in Switzerland.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division incurred operating expenses of $5.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net loss for the Biopharm Division was $5.4 million and for the Neurostimulation Division was $0.6 million.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division incurred operating expenses of $16.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net loss for the Biopharm Division was $15.7 million and for the Neurostimulation Division was $1.7 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total assets for the Biopharm Division and the Neurostimulation Division were $41.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively. \n\nThe Company’s long-term assets are located in the United States.\n\n_Significant Accounting Policies_\n\nOur significant accounting policies are set forth in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, _Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)_. This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, _Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740)_. The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Note 3. Concentration of Risk**\n\n_Credit Risk_\n\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We maintain cash, certificates of deposit and money market funds with financial institutions that we deem reputable.\n\n_Foreign Operations_\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 include assets amounting to approximately $27,000 and $0.1 million, respectively, relating to our operations in Switzerland. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia was established to support studies of our product candidates. Unanticipated events in foreign countries could disrupt our operations and impair the value of these assets.\n\n**Note 4. Fair Value Measurements**\n\nThe authoritative guidance with respect to fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.\n\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that we have the ability to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded securities and exchange-based derivatives.\n\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.\n\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.\n\nWe determine the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, we perform an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.\n\nCash equivalents, which include certificates of deposit and money market funds, are the only financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and are valued using Level 1 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any Level 1 and Level 2 financial liabilities or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or transfers in or out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):\n\nAs of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nAssets  \nCash equivalents:  \nCertificates of deposit | $ | 7,112 | $ | 7,112 | $ | - | $ | -  \nMoney market funds | 11,112 | 11,112 | - | -  \nTotal | $ | 18,224 | $ | 18,224 | $ | - | $ | -  \nAs of December 31, 2023  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nAssets  \nCash equivalents:  \nMoney market funds | $ | 18,629 | $ | 18,629 | $ | - | $ | -  \nTotal | $ | 18,629 | $ | 18,629 | $ | - | $ | -  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \n**Note 5.Insurance Premium Financing**\n\n**In September 2024, we entered into a finance agreement with First Insurance Funding in order to fund a portion of our insurance premiums for our professional liability policies. The amount financed is approximately $** 426,000 **and incurs interest at a rate of** 7.2%**. The Company is required to make nine monthly payments of approximately $**47,000 **through** May 2025**. The outstanding balance as of** September 30, 2024 **was approximately $** 379,000 and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\n**Note 6.

Equity Securities**\n\nWe are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock with 55,266,435 issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with none issued as of September 30, 2024.\n\n_Securities Purchase Agreement_\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the common stock and Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in the Offering. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. The Company also entered into a Placement Agency Agreement with Maxim, who acted as the sole placement agent for the Offering. In connection with the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Maxim an aggregate cash fee of 7.0% of the aggregate proceeds raised from the sale and issuance of the shares of common stock and accompanying warrants. Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company also agreed to reimburse Maxim up to $65,000 for its legal expenses. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other estimated offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, until 45 days following the closing of the Offering, the Company agreed not to issue (or enter into any agreement to issue) any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to certain exceptions. The Company has further agreed not to enter into an agreement involving a variable rate transaction until one year following the closing of the Offering. In addition, the Company’s directors and officers have entered into lock-up agreements with the Company pursuant to which each of them has agreed not to, for a period of 90 days from the closing of the Offering, offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Company’s securities, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nAt-the-Market Sales Agreement\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\nThe Company may sell the common stock under the Sales Agreement (A) in privately negotiated transactions; (B) as block transactions; or (C) by any other method permitted by law deemed to be an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market or sales made into any other existing trading market for the shares of Common Stock. Jefferies will use commercially reasonable efforts to place the shares of common stock from time to time, based upon the Company's instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). The Company will pay Jefferies a commission of up to three percent (3.0%) of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies under the Sales Agreement, and also has provided Jefferies with customary indemnification rights. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain legal expenses and fees incurred by Jefferies in connection with the offering.\n\nThe Company is not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. The offering of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all common stock subject to the Sales Agreement or (ii) termination of the Sales Agreement in accordance with its terms.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 287,970 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $504,000 as part of the Sales Agreement with Jefferies. The Company paid expenses of $344,000, resulting in net proceeds of $160,000. \n\n**Note 8. Warrants**\n\nA summary of warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is presented below (in thousands, except per share and contractual life data).\n\nNumber of  Shares | Weighted  Average  Exercise  Price  Per Share | Weighted  Average  Remaining  Contractual  Life (in Years)  \n---|---|---  \nWarrants outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 9,733 | $ | 11.60 | 1.4  \nIssued | 3,947 | $ | 3.80  \nExercised | - | $ | -  \nForfeited or expired | (3,768 | ) | $ | 24.98  \nWarrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024 | 9,912 | $ | 3.41 | 2.28  \nWarrants exercisable as of September 30, 2024 | 9,912 | $ | 3.41 | 2.28  \n  \nNPM, prior to the merger with Second Sight, issued common stock and warrants (collectively, the “unit” or “units”) in 2019, 2020 and 2021 for $3.15 per unit. Outstanding warrants to purchase common stock are shown in the table above and generally expire five years from the date of issuance at $3.15 per share exercise price are transferable into one share of common stock and may be exercised on a cashless basis.\n\nSecond Sight underwriter warrants of 10,125 were outstanding and are convertible into 3,375 shares, included in the table above, and converted as part of the merger for Vivani warrants on a like-for-like basis. The weighted average exercise price of these warrants is $3.75.\n\nIn connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement entered on March 1, 2024, relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, the Company issued Warrants to purchase 3,947,368 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.80 per share. These Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis.\n\nThe warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024 had no intrinsic value.\n\n**Note 9. Stock-Based Compensation**\n\n**Equity Incentive Plan**\n\nThe Vivani Medical, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) became effective on August 30, 2022. Under the 2022 Plan, 10,033,333 shares were authorized for issuance at its effective date. The maximum number of shares with respect to which stock awards could be granted is offset and reduced by stock awards previously granted under the 2022 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, 2,165,958 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the 2022 Plan pursuant to stock awards that had not previously been granted.\n\nFor stock option grants, the option price is determined by the Board of Directors but cannot be less than the fair value of the shares at the grant date. Generally, the options vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the grant date. The 2022 Plan provides for accelerated vesting if there is a change of control, as defined in the 2022 Plan.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n_Stock Options_\n\nA summary of stock option activity is presented below (in thousands, except per share and contractual life data).\n\nWeighted  \n---  \nWeighted | Average  \nAverage | Remaining  \nExercise | Contractual  \nNumber of | Price | Life  \nShares | Per Share | (in Years)  \nOptions outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 6,091 | $ | 2.60 | 6.96  \nGranted | 1,093 | $ | 1.57  \nExercised | - | $ | -  \nForfeited or expired | (375 | ) | $ | 1.19  \nOptions outstanding, vested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2024 | 6,809 | $ | 2.52 | 6.80  \nOptions exercisable as of September 30, 2024 | 4,660 | $ | 2.94 | 5.87  \n  \nThe estimated aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable as of September 30, 2024 was $0.01 million.\n\n_Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)_\n\nA summary of restricted stock activity and related information (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nNumber of Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share  \n---|---  \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 403 | $ | 0.93  \nGranted | 292 | $ | 1.69  \nVested and released | - | $ | -  \nForfeited and canceled | - | $ | -  \nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 | 695 | $ | 1.25  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 292,500 RSUs, subject to market conditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15 per share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the RSUs to vest. Upon achievement of the market condition, one-third of the award will vest, and thereafter, one-third of the award will vest on the first and second anniversary of the achievement date, subject to the recipient’s continued service through each applicable vesting date.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted 402,500 RSUs, subject to market conditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15 per share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the RSUs to vest. Upon achievement of the market condition, one-third of the award will vest, and thereafter, one-third of the award will vest on the first and second anniversary of the achievement date, subject to the recipient’s continued service through each applicable vesting date.\n\n**Stock-Based Compensation Expense**\n\nThe following table summarizes total stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs, which is included in the statements of operations (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nResearch and development | $ | 275 | $ | 277 | $ | 757 | $ | 809  \nGeneral and administrative | 197 | 234 | 451 | 595  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense | $ | 472 | $ | 511 | $ | 1,208 | $ | 1,404  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $2.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. As of September 30, 2024, there was $0.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding RSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 year.\n\n_Stock Options_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted stock options to purchase 1,092,836 shares of common stock to certain employees and board members. The options are exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of grant at a weighted average price of $1.57 per share, which was calculated at the fair value of our common stock on the respective grant date. The options generally vest over a period of four years.\n\n_Stock Options (Service Vesting)_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,092,836 stock options subject to service vesting, were issued and valued at $1.4 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1,093,817 stock options subject to service vesting, were issued and valued at $1.1 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The calculated value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions.\n\nSummary of Option Grant using the Black-Scholes Option-pricing Model\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nRisk-free interest rate | 3.79% to 5.53% | 3.99% to 4.45%  \nExpected dividend yield | -% | -%  \nExpected volatility | 100% | 100%  \nExpected term |  5.04 to 6.08 years | 4.00 to 6.20 years  \n  \n_Stock Options (Market Conditions Vesting)_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 200,000 stock options were granted and subject to market conditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15 per share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the stock option to vest. These stock options with market conditions vesting were valued at $0.1 million. The Company recognized the associated stock-based compensation expense of $20,000 and $20,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $61,000 and $46,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of these options subject to market conditions were valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation model with the following assumptions:\n\n● | **Beginning Stock Price.** We utilized the Company’s publicly traded share price as of the Valuation Date as the beginning stock value. At the Valuation Date, the publicly traded common share price was $1.09 per share.  \n---|---  \n● | **Drift Rate.** In determining the value of the instrument in the risk-neutral framework, risk-free rates were estimated based on the applicable treasury rate for the projection period. For each simulation, the term of the risk-free rate was based on the term from the Valuation Date through the latest date on which the award could vest (i.e., two years following the Performance Period End Date). Please note that, for the purposes of calculating the service period associated with the Subject Interest, the Company’s cost of equity was utilized as the drift rate.  \n---|---  \n● | **Volatility.** The total equity volatility (standard deviation) was based on a total equity volatility analysis.  \n---|---  \n● | **Period.** The period was measured as the number of years from the Valuation Date through the PSO expiration date (10 years following the date of grant).  \n---|---  \n● | **Dividends.** The Company has not historically paid dividends. In addition, the Company does not expect to pay dividends going forward. As such, no dividends were considered in our analysis.  \n---|---  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n_Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 292,500 RSUs. These RSUs are subject to performance vesting criteria, based on market conditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15 per share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the RSUs to vest. The Company recognized the associated stock-based compensation expense of $126,000 and $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $197,000 and $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024and 2023, respectively. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and valued using a Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \nRSUs Granted | 292,500 | 402,500  \nValuation date stock price | $1.81 | $0.93  \nRisk-free interest rate | 4.53% | 4.13%  \nExpected dividendyield | 0% | 0%  \nExpected volatility | 100% | 100%  \nSimulation term | 4 Years | 1.1 Years  \n  \nThe steps involved in utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation in order to value the performance-based RSUs included the following:\n\n**1. Projection of the Company’s Common Stock Value. **The performance-based RSUs were measured based on the Company’s underlying common stock value over the performance period (four years following the Valuation Date). \n\nAdditionally, we considered the two-year vesting period following achievement of the performance condition. Accordingly, our common stock value was simulated over a six-year period to capture iterations through which the performance condition was satisfied on the Performance Period End Date. The analysis involved projecting our common stock value starting with our current common stock value. The forecasted stock price was based on the Geometric Brownian motion (“GBM”), and the Monte Carlo simulation generated random variables using the GBM to forecast our stock price on a daily basis over the specified period assuming 252 trading days per year. The Monte Carlo simulation for the PSO utilized the following assumptions:\n\n● | **Beginning Stock Price.** As of the Valuation Date, we were a publicly traded company with an observable share price. Therefore, we utilized our publicly traded share price as of the Valuation Date as the beginning stock value.   \n---|---  \n● | **Drift Rate.** In determining the value of the instrument in the risk-neutral framework, risk free rates were estimated based on the applicable treasury rate for the projection period. For each simulation, the term of the risk-free rate was based on the term from the Valuation Date through the latest date on which the award could vest (i.e., two years following the Performance Period End Date). Please note that, for the purposes of calculating the service period associated with the Subject Interest, our cost of equity was utilized as the drift rate.  \n---|---  \n● | **Volatility.** The total equity volatility (standard deviation) was based on a total equity volatility analysis.  \n---|---  \n● | **Period.** The period was measured as the number of years from the Valuation Date through the latest date on which the award could vest.  \n---|---  \n● | **Dividends.** We have not historically paid dividends nor do we expect to pay dividends going forward. As such, no dividends were considered in our analysis.  \n---|---  \n  \n**2. Consideration of the Performance-Vesting Schedule. **As previously discussed, our publicly traded common share price must equal or exceed the Stock Price Hurdle amount of $3.15 over a 3-consecutive-trading-day rolling period on or before the Performance Period End Date. If such performance condition is achieved, 1/3 of the award shall vest on the Hurdle Achievement Date, 1/3 of the award shall vest one year following the Hurdle Achievement Date, and 1/3 of the award shall vest two years following the Hurdle Achievement Date. \n\n**3. Performance-Based RSU Value Conclusion**. The proceeds from the vesting of common shares were then discounted to the Valuation Date using the applicable risk-free rate, which is consistent with the assumption utilized to project stock prices in our Monte Carlo simulation. For the purpose of calculating the weighted service period associated with the Subject Interest, a separate simulation was performed using our cost of equity as the drift rate. The service period was then determined based on the median Hurdle Achievement Date.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Note 10. Net Loss Per Share**\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of potential dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effects of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities include common stock options, RSUs and warrants issued and outstanding.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): \n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss | $ | (6,041 | ) | $ | (6,782 | ) | $ | (17,436 | ) | $ | (19,626 | )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted | 55,247 | 50,837 | 54,161 | 50,757  \nNet loss per common share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.13 | ) | $ | (0.32 | ) | $ | (0.39 | )  \n  \nSince the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods presented, as the inclusion of all potential common stock equivalents outstanding would have been antidilutive.\n\nDuring the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because including them would have been antidilutive (in thousands).\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nStock options issued and outstanding | 6,809 | 6,043  \nUnvested restricted stock units issued and outstanding | 695 | 403  \nWarrants to purchase common stock | 9,912 | 10,311  \nTotal | 17,416 | 16,757  \n  \n**Note 11. Right-of-use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities**\n\nWe lease certain office, laboratory, research and development space for our use. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease costs are recognized in the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective assets. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we used our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\nOn November 21, 2022, Vivani entered into a triple net lease agreement for a single building with 43,645 square feet of space in Alameda, California. The stated term of the lease commenced on June 1, 2023 and terminates on September 30, 2033, ten years and four months. The lease term is based on the non-cancellable period in the lease agreement. There are two options to extend the lease, each for a term of five years; however, the extension options were not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability since it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such extension options. Payments increase annually from $2,676,311 to $3,596,784, or 124 monthly payments less the first four which are abated, totaling approximately $31.0 million. Vivani is responsible for insurance, property taxes and common area maintenance charges. Vivani deposited $1.3 million to guarantee a letter of credit to secure the lease and this amount is recorded as restricted cash, long-term on the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The lease in Emeryville, California expired on September 30, 2023.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we entered into a lease agreement, effective March 1, 2023, to sublease office space to replace Cortigent’s headquarters. Our rental payments amount to $22,158 per month plus operating expenses, to lease 14,823 square feet of office space at 27200 Tourney Road, Valencia, California 91355. The sublease has a term of two years and two months. We also entered into a lease for storage space on January 25, 2023, in the same building at a cost of $6,775 per month for a term of two years and one month.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nThe following table summarizes supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \nBalance Sheet Classification | 2024 | 2023  \nAssets  \nNon-current assets | Right-of-use assets | $ | 18,383 | $ | 19,616  \nLiabilities  \nCurrent | Current operating lease liabilities | $ | 1,385 | $ | 1,383  \nLong-term | Long-term operating lease liabilities | $ | 18,294 | $ | 19,313  \n  \nOperating lease cost was $0.8 million and $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.5 million and $1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nVariable lease cost, comprising primarily of common area maintenance charges and taxes, for the operating lease was $0.1 million and $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes a maturity analysis of our lease liabilities showing the aggregate lease payments as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands except weighted average data):\n\nYear Ending December 31, | Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | $ | 775  \n2025 | 2,914  \n2026 | 2,889  \n2027 | 2,976  \n2028 | 3,065  \nThereafter | 15,862  \nTotal lease payments | $ | 28,481  \nLess imputed interest | (8,802 | )  \nTotal lease liabilities | $ | 19,679  \nWeighted average discount rate  | 8.40 | %  \nWeighted average remaining lease term | 8.90 years  \n  \nOther information related to leases are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nCash paid for operating lease liabilities | $ | 776 | $ | 375 | $ | 2,294 | $ | 1,134  \n  \n**Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n**Indemnification Agreements**\n\nWe maintain indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify them against liabilities that arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, except as prohibited by applicable law.\n\n**Clinical Trial Agreements**\n\nBased upon FDA approval of Argus II, which was obtained in February 2013, we were required to collect follow-up data from subjects enrolled in our pre-approval trial for a period of up to ten years post-implant, which was extended through the year 2019. This requirement to collect follow-up data was halted in 2020 with FDA approval. In addition, we conducted three post-market studies to comply with U.S. FDA, French, and European post-market surveillance regulations and requirements and are conducting an early feasibility clinical study of Orion. We have contracted with various universities, hospitals, and medical practices to provide these services. Payments are based on procedures performed for each subject and are charged to clinical and regulatory expense as incurred. Total amounts expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $3,000 and $4,000, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $13,000 and $119,000, respectively.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Litigation, Claims and Assessments**\n\nOne opposition filed by Pixium Vision SA (“Pixium”) is pending in the European Patent Office challenging the validity of a European patent owned by Cortigent. The outcome of the challenge is not certain, however, if successful, it may affect our ability to block competitors from utilizing Cortigent’s neurostimulation patented technology. We believe a successful challenge will not have a material effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products, or otherwise have a material effect on Cortigent’s operations.\n\nAs described in the Company’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) for a proposed business combination with Pixium. In response to a press release by Pixium dated March 24, 2021, and subsequent communications between us and Pixium, our Board of Directors determined that the business combination with Pixium was not in the best interest of our shareholders. On April 1, 2021, we gave notice to Pixium that we were terminating the MOU between the parties and seeking an amicable resolution of termination amounts that may be due, however no assurance can be given that an amicable resolution will be reached. We accrued $1,000,000 of liquidated damages as contemplated by the MOU in accounts payable as of March 31, 2021 and remitted that amount to Pixium in April 2021. Pixium indicated that it considered this termination wrongful, rejected the Company’s offers, but retained the $1,000,000 payment. On May 19, 2021, Pixium filed suit in the Paris Commercial Court, and currently claim damages of approximately €5.1 million or about $5.6 million. We believe we have fulfilled our obligations to Pixium with the liquidated damages payment of $1,000,000. On December 8, 2022, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court has rendered its judgment, including finding that the Company’s termination of the MOU was not valid. In the judgment, the Company was ordered to pay to Pixium the amount of €2,500,000 minus a €947,780 credit for the $1,000,000 already paid for, a net amount payable of approximately €1,552,220. On May 24, 2023, the Company filed an appeal against the judgment from the Paris Commercial Court except in so far as such prior judgment dismissed (i) Pixium’s claim for the Company to pay it a sum of €480,693 relating to the alleged time spent by its teams, (ii) Pixium’s application to order the Company to pay it a sum of €1,500,000 in respect to alleged loss of opportunity and (iii) deducted the sum of $1,000,000 that we already paid Pixium and which Pixium retained converted into euros at the date of the judgment. Thereafter Pixium filed its brief with Paris Court of Appeal and filed a cross-appeal on January 18, 2024. Meanwhile, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court had opened safeguard proceedings against Pixium by judgment dated October 9, 2023, then in its judgment dated November 13, 2023, converted safeguard proceedings into receivership, and in its judgment dated January 31, 2024, converted Pixium’s receivership proceedings to liquidation proceedings, the transfer plan being rejected. As a result, Pixium’s liquidator intervened on behalf of Pixium in the pending proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal and filed its brief on March 21, 2024. The Company filed its brief in reply with the Paris Court of Appeal on April 17, 2024. Proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal are pending. In parallel, since the Company has failed to enforce the judgment, Pixium has requested the pre-trial judge to strike out the Company's appeal for failure to enforce the judgment. The hearing took place on June 4, 2024 and on October 23, 2024, the pre-trial judge issued his order, striking out Vivani's appeal for failure to enforce the decision. Within two years, Vivani will have to request that the case be reinstated on the court's docket, providing evidence that the judgment has been fully enforced or, at the very least, that an agreement has been reached. Failing this, the appeal proceedings will lapse.\n\nThe Company recorded a charge of $1,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to this matter but plans to continue its appeal against the preliminary judgment. \n\nWe are party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations, however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\n\n**Note 13. Subsequent Event**\n\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share, which was the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq or the 5-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq, each immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the common stock that occur after the date of the private sale transaction. The gross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5,000,000.00.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2.

(“Vivani,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) is a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company which develops miniaturized, subdermal implants utilizing its proprietary NanoPortal™ technology to enable ultra long-term, near constant-rate delivery of a broad range of medicines to treat chronic diseases. Vivani uses this platform technology to develop and potentially commercialize drug implant candidates, alone or in collaboration with pharmaceutical company partners to address a leading cause of poor clinical outcomes in the treatment of chronic disease, medication non-adherence. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adherence is defined as the extent to which an individual’s behavior, including taking medications, corresponds to recommendations from a health care provider. An alarmingly high proportion of patients, approximately 50%, do not take their medicine as prescribed by their physician in the real world, a statistic which holds for both weekly injectable and daily oral medications. In addition, a recent study has shown that 64% of patients taking Wegovy® (semaglutide for weight management) discontinue therapy within the first year, a number which increases to 76% by year two. The Company is developing a portfolio of miniature, subdermal drug implant candidates that, unlike most oral and injectable medicines, are designed with the goal of guaranteeing medication adherence by delivering therapeutic drug levels for up to six months or longer. In addition, our aim is to minimize fluctuations in patients’ drug levels through the use of our proprietary NanoPortal™ implant technology, which may improve the tolerability profiles for medicines, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, that produce side effects associated with fluctuating drug levels in the blood.\n\nVivani resulted from the business combination of Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (“Second Sight”) and Nano Precision Medical, Inc. (“NPM”). On August 30, 2022, Second Sight and NPM closed their merger pursuant to which NPM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Second Sight and the combined company of NPM and Second Sight was renamed Vivani Medical, Inc. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of the company’s lead program NPM-115, a miniature, six-month, GLP-1 implant candidate for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients with one or more risk factors and further development of the balance of company’s miniature, long-term drug implant portfolio. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remained committed to identifying and exploring strategic options that will enable further development of its pioneering neurostimulation systems from legacy company Second Sight aimed at helping patients recover critical body functions.\n\nMoving forward, Vivani’s focus will be on the further development of NPM-115 and its emerging pipeline of innovative miniature, long-term drug implants to treat patients with chronic diseases and high unmet medical need. The origins of this business started while its current Vivani CEO and NPM co-founder Adam Mendelsohn and two of his graduate school colleagues, Kathleen Fischer and Lily Peng, at the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) and the University of California, Berkeley (“UCB”), entered business school competitions leveraging their growing knowledge of chemistry, drug delivery, and nanoscale technology to propose the development of new miniature, biocompatible, drug implant prototypes capable of releasing therapeutic drug levels over an extended period of time. Based on their success and encouragement from professors and others, including medical device/pharmaceutical icon Alfred E. Mann, Dr. Mendelsohn and colleagues started NPM in 2009 and operations began in 2011 in an incubator on the UCB campus. Today, the Company has grown to 36 full-time employees and its current headquarters and operations are located at 1350 South Loop Road, Alameda, California.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\nVivani’s implant technology, which we refer to as NanoPortal™, utilizes a space-efficient design that allows a miniaturized implant to provide many months of therapeutic delivery of potent molecules. The technology has no moving parts, which is intended to minimize fluctuating drug delivery over the duration of the implant and is also tunable. Vivani has primarily been developing implant candidates around peptide therapeutics, but the technology has potential application across a wide range of molecular types. The key innovative component of the technology is a biocompatible titanium-oxide nano-porous membrane which consists of millions of precisely sized nanotubes whose inner diameters represent the only path for drug molecules to exit the reservoir once the implant is fully assembled.\n\nIn December 2022, we contributed our neurostimulation assets and certain liabilities to Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivani. Cortigent has 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, all owned by Vivani. Cortigent is advancing the Company’s pioneering neurostimulation technology. In March 2023, Vivani announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the proposed initial public offering of Cortigent. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 was recently amended and filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024 to refresh the financial information and provide minor updates to the business.\n\nOn July 6, 2023, Vivani changed its state of incorporation from the State of California to the State of Delaware by means of a plan of conversion, effective July 5, 2023. The reincorporation, including the principal terms of the plan of conversion, was submitted to a vote of, and approved by, Vivani’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 15, 2023. As part of this change of incorporation the Company established a par value of $0.0001 per share and all periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change.\n\nAn Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for NPM-119 (GLP-1 implant for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on July 14, 2023, to support the initiation of the first-in-human study of NPM-119 in patients with type 2 diabetes. On August 18, 2023, FDA provided written notification that the proposed NPM-119 study was on full clinical hold, primarily due to insufficient Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information to assess the risk to human subjects. Vivani provided the FDA with the requested CMC information and the FDA subsequently cleared the IND and lifted the full clinical hold on June 13, 2024.\n\nOn August 25, 2023, Vivani and Cortigent entered into an Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Transition Funding, Support and Services Agreement dated March 19, 2023 (the “TFSSA”). Pursuant to the TFSSA, Vivani has agreed to advance funds and provide or cause to be provided to Cortigent the services and funding intended to cover salaries and related costs, rent and other overhead in order to permit Cortigent to operate in substantially the same manner in which business operations of Cortigent were previously operated by Second Sight, prior to the formation of Cortigent, which obligations will continue, in the case of the funding obligations, until the earlier of December 31, 2024 or the closing of an initial public offering of Cortigent (the “Funding Support Term”). Under the Amendment, Cortigent has agreed to repay $1,500,000 to Vivani at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term. In addition, at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term, Cortigent will enter into a five-year promissory note at 5% interest for $2,000,000 in favor of Vivani. Consequently, Vivani will forgive any remaining amounts due by Cortigent to the Company under the TFSSA. In October 2023, Vivani implemented a reduction-in-force to conserve cash that decreased Cortigent’s employees while continuing the ongoing Orion® clinical study and basic operations.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia was established to support studies of our product candidates.\n\nIn February 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical weight loss data with a GLP-1 (exenatide) implant comparable to semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic®/Wegovy®, and a strategic shift to prioritize our obesity portfolio including our NPM-115 program. In a study of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, NPM-115 generated weight loss of approximately 20% compared to a sham implant control after a 28-day treatment duration, comparable to weight loss observed in mice treated with semaglutide injections (Ozempic®/Wegovy®) in the same study. The Company also disclosed that semaglutide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NPM-139, a miniature, subdermal GLP-1 implant in development for chronic weight management, with the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor to purchase 3,947,368 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrant in a registered direct offering. The warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire three years following the date of issuance. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Daniel Bradbury to its Board of Directors. Under Bradbury’s leadership as CEO, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, with partner Alkermes, secured the 2012 approval of Bydureon® (exenatide injection), the world’s first weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, a class of drugs that now includes blockbusters Ozempic®, Trulicity® and Wegovy®.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement with an underwriter, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through such underwriter as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of common stock in accordance with the sales agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\nOn May 28, 2024, Vivani announced the publication of positive weigh loss data supporting the potential veterinary use of OKV-119, the Company's miniature, long-term GLP-1 implant under development with partner Okava for the treatment of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and obesity in companion felines. The device is intended to be conveniently inserted under the skin during routine veterinary visits and is being designed to deliver six months of GLP-1 therapy with a single implant.\n\nOn June 13, 2024, the Company announced that the FDA cleared the IND for NPM-119, a miniature, long-term subdermal GLP-1 implant under investigation to address medication non-adherence and potentially improve tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes. The proposed first-in-human clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of the exenatide implant versus the marketed exenatide injectable, Bydureon BCise®.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company provided an update of the clinical development plans for NPM-115, the miniature, long-acting GLP-1 (high-dose exenatide) implant for the treatment of chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The Company has redesigned the first-in-human study, LIBERATE-1, to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an exenatide implant (initially using the same test article proposed for NPM-119) in obese and overweight patients. The study will enroll patients who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for eight weeks before being randomized to receive a single exenatide implant, weekly exenatide injections (Bydureon BCise®) or weekly semaglutide injections (Wegovy®) for a nine-week treatment duration. The LIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia and is anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending regulatory clearance, with data from the study expected in 2025.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical liver fat results with its miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 implant currently under development chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals and type 2 diabetes. The Company's GLP-1 (exenatide) implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat reduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. These liver fat data are consistent with published results from similar investigations with semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic® and Wegovy®.\n\nOn September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to initiate its first in human clinical trial with a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. This clinical trial, known as LIBERATE-1™, is part of the NPM-115 program and will investigate the safety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile of an exenatide implant. The trial also represents the first clinical application of the Company’s proprietary NanoPortal™ drug implant technology. LIBERATE-1 is designed to enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or weekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. The trial is expected to be initiated later this year with data projected to be available in 2025.\n\n**Funding and Liquidity**\n\n_Capital Funding_\n\nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock and warrants. On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share (the “common stock”) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock (the “Warrants”), to such investor at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. Simultaneously, the Company also entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and such agreement, the “Placement Agency Agreement,” and together with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the “Agreements”), who acted as the sole placement agent for the Offering. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDuring the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of $48,000 and 160,000 from issuing common stocks under the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, respectively.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n_Non-Capital Funding_\n\nFrom time to time, we receive grants that help fund specific development programs. Any amounts received pursuant to grants are offset against the related operating expenses as the costs are incurred. Commencing in January 2018, we were awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) to fund the “Early Feasibility Clinical Trial of a Visual Cortical Prosthesis”. The final year of the grant ended in March 2024, however the NIH issued us a no-cost extension allowing us to utilize the unfunded amount through March 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total grants offsetting against operating expenses were $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we expect $70,000 will be available to offset future operating expenses.\n\n_Liquidity_\n\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have financed our working capital requirements through the recurring sale of our equity securities. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\n\nTo finance our operations, we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we will need to seek additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs, or we may be unable to expand or maintain our operations, maintain our current organization and employee base or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and/or develop profitable operations through implementation of our business initiatives, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission require management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n_Operating Expenses._ We recognize our operating expenses as incurred in two general operational categories: research and development and general and administrative. Our operating expenses also include a non-cash component related to the amortization of stock-based compensation for research and development and general and administrative personnel. From time-to-time we have received grants from institutions or agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, to help fund some of the cost of our development efforts. We have recorded these grants as reductions to operating expenses.\n\n● |  Research and development expense consist primarily of employee compensation and consulting costs related to the design, development, and enhancements of our current and potential future products, as well as internal and external costs associated with conducting clinical trials and maintaining relationships with regulatory agencies, as well as facilities costs, which include expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities and depreciation of equipment, offset by grant revenue received in support of specific research projects. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future products. We also expect to receive additional grants in the future that will primarily offset research and development costs.  \n---|---  \n● | General and administrative expense consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting and professional fees, patent filing and annuity costs, insurance costs and other general corporate expenses, including rent and other facility related costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operate as a public company.  \n  \n23  \n---  \n  \n**Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n_Research and development expense._ Research and development expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million, or 5%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside services from our neurostimulation division, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expense from ourBiopharmadivision. \n\n_General and administrative expense._ General and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, compared to $2.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 22%, was primarily attributable to staffing reductions along with reduced outside legal services from our neurostimulation division, in addition to reducedprofessional services from our Biopharma division.\n\n_Other income, net._ Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was not significant.\n\n**Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n_Research and development expense._ Research and development expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 7%, to $11.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $12.3 million in the same period of 2023. The costs decreased was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside services from our neurostimulation division, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expense from ourBiopharmadivision. \n\n_General and administrative expense._ General and administrative expense decreased $1.7 million, or 20%, to $6.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $8.5 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to staffing reductions along with reduced outside legal services from our neurostimulation division.\n\n_Other income, net._ Other income, net during thenine months ended September 30, 2024was $0.8million, compared to $1.1million during thenine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower interest associated with lower cash balances.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have financed our working capital requirements through the recurring sale of our equity securities. Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that our business is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in a registered direct offering. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. In connection with the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Maxim an aggregate cash fee of 7.0% of the aggregate proceeds raised from the sale and issuance of the shares of common stock and accompanying warrants. Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company also agreed to reimburse Maxim up to $65,000 for its legal expenses. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other estimated offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to develop profitable operations through implementation of our business initiatives and/or raise additional capital, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no revenue that is developing a novel pharmaceutical product candidates and medical device candidates, including limitations on our operating capital resources and uncertain demand for our products. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue our business operations, particularly as we prepare to and initiate our planned clinical trial and conduct our other research and development activities. Conducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval. We do not expect revenues until we are successful in completing the development and obtaining marketing approval for our products. We expect expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate clinical trials, initiate new research and development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. If we are required to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical activities preclinical or IND-enabling activities such as additional pre-clinical, our overall expenditures would increase. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval, we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such product. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. We incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company in a regulated industry.\n\nUntil such time, if ever, we can generate product revenues, we anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, the ownership interests of some or all of our common stockholders will be diluted, the holders of new equity securities may have priority rights over our existing stockholders and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms. If, for example, we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our inability to raise capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by $1.0 million from $22.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to $21.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Working capital was $15.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $17.3 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.2 million. We use our cash and cash equivalents and working capital to fund our operating activities.\n\n_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $15.0 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $17.4 million, partially offset by $0.7 million provided by a net change in operating assets and liabilities and non-cash items totaling $1.8 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation and lease expense.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $20.2 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $19.6 million and a net increase in net operating assets of $3.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.4 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation and lease expense.\n\n_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_\n\nCash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\n\n_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $14.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $110,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from exercise of options.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n**Item 3.[ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk](#TOC)**\n\n_Interest Rate Sensitivity_\n\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity without incurring significant risk. We invest cash in excess of our current needs in certificates of deposit and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents consisted of certificates of deposit, money market funds and restricted cash as collateral for our lease.\n\n_Exchange Rate Sensitivity_\n\nThe majority of our operating expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars. We have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our operating expense exposure to foreign currencies, but we may do so in the future.\n\n**Item 4. [Controls and Procedures](#TOC)**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are updating our internal control environment to address changes in our risks in financial reporting to accommodate our operating activities, staffing levels, and segregation of duties. Such changes may result in new or reduced controls.\n\n_Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls_\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\n26  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n[**PART II-OTHER INFORMATION**](#TOC)\n\n**Item 1.[ Legal Proceedings](#TOC)**\n\nOne opposition filed by Pixium Vision SA (“Pixium”) is pending in the European Patent Office challenging the validity of a European patent owned by Cortigent. The outcome of the challenge is not certain, however, if successful, it may affect our ability to block competitors from utilizing Cortigent’s neurostimulation patented technology. We believe a successful challenge will not have a material effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products, or otherwise have a material effect on Cortigent’s operations. \n\nAs described in the Company’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) for a proposed business combination with Pixium. In response to a press release by Pixium dated March 24, 2021, and subsequent communications between us and Pixium, our Board of Directors determined that the business combination with Pixium was not in the best interest of our shareholders. On April 1, 2021, we gave notice to Pixium that we were terminating the MOU between the parties and seeking an amicable resolution of termination amounts that may be due, however no assurance can be given that an amicable resolution will be reached. We accrued $1,000,000 of liquidated damages as contemplated by the MOU in accounts payable as of March 31, 2021 and remitted that amount to Pixium in April 2021. Pixium indicated that it considered this termination wrongful, rejected the Company’s offers, but retained the $1,000,000 payment. On May 19, 2021, Pixium filed suit in the Paris Commercial Court, and currently claim damages of approximately €5.1 million or about $5.6 million. We believe we have fulfilled our obligations to Pixium with the liquidated damages payment of $1,000,000. On December 8, 2022, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court has rendered its judgment, including finding that the Company’s termination of the MOU was not valid. In the judgment, the Company was ordered to pay to Pixium the amount of €2,500,000 minus a €947,780 credit for the $1,000,000 already paid for, a net amount payable of approximately €1,552,220. On May 24, 2023, the Company filed an appeal against the judgment from the Paris Commercial Court except in so far as such prior judgment dismissed (i) Pixium’s claim for the Company to pay it a sum of €480,693 relating to the alleged time spent by its teams, (ii) Pixium’s application to order the Company to pay it a sum of €1,500,000 in respect to alleged loss of opportunity and (iii) deducted the sum of $1,000,000 that we already paid Pixium and which Pixium retained converted into euros at the date of the judgment. Thereafter Pixium filed its brief with Paris Court of Appeal and filed a cross-appeal on January 18, 2024. Meanwhile, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court had opened safeguard proceedings against Pixium by judgment dated October 9, 2023, then in its judgment dated November 13, 2023, converted safeguard proceedings into receivership, and in its judgment dated January 31, 2024, converted Pixium’s receivership proceedings to liquidation proceedings, the transfer plan being rejected. As a result, Pixium’s liquidator intervened on behalf of Pixium in the pending proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal and filed its brief on March 21, 2024. The Company filed its brief in reply with the Paris Court of Appeal on April 17, 2024. Proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal are pending. In parallel, since the Company has failed to enforce the judgment, Pixium has requested the pre-trial judge to strike out the Company's appeal for failure to enforce the judgment. The hearing took place on June 4, 2024, and on October 23, 2024, the pre-trial judge issued his order, striking out Vivani's appeal for failure to enforce the decision. Within two years, Vivani will have to request that the case be reinstated on the court's docket, providing evidence that the judgment has been fully enforced or, at the very least, that an agreement has been reached. Failing this, the appeal proceedings will lapse.\n\nThe Company recorded a charge of $1,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to this matter but plans to continue its appeal against the preliminary judgment.\n\nWe are party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements, however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. \n\n**Item 1A.[Risk Factors](#TOC)**\n\nOur business is subject to numerous material and other risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and in our other filings with the SEC. If any of the stated risks actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could suffer materially. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The material risks associated with our business were most recently discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that we filed on March 26, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such filing, expect as noted below:\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital**\n\n**_We will require substantial additional financing to pursue our business objectives, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, commercialization efforts or other operations._**\n\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes years to complete. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we will incur significant costs associated with sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution activities. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or preclinical studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. For example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes and on September 26, 2024, we received regulatory approval to initiate a first in human clinical trial, known as the LIBERATE-1™, with the Company’s GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. Because the design and outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical trials are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amount of resources and funding that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any product candidate. We are not permitted to market or promote any product candidate before it receives marketing approval from the regulatory authorities. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations and pursue our business objectives.\n\n**Risks Related to Product Development, Clinical Testing and Commercialization**\n\n**_Clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. We may incur additional costs and experience delays in developing our product candidates, and our clinical development efforts may not yield favorable results._**\n\nTo receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA, and comparable foreign authorities. We have not yet conducted clinical trials for our current product candidates and clinical testing of such product candidates may not yield results to support continued development or seeking regulatory approval. The development process is expensive, can take many years and has an uncertain outcome. Failure can occur at any stage of the process. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the development process that could delay or prevent development and approval of our product candidates, including the following:\n\n• | we may be unable to initiate or conduct planned clinical trials on our anticipated timelines, including as a result of failing to obtain any clearances necessary to conduct clinical trials or being subject to clinical holds that prevent continuation of such trials;  \n---|---  \n• | clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results;  \n• | preclinical studies conducted with product candidates during clinical development to, among other things, evaluate their safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and optimize their formulation may produce unfavorable results;  \n• | patient recruitment and enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than anticipated;  \n• | costs of development may be greater than anticipated;  \n• | our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use or market acceptance, if approved;  \n• | if one or more product candidates are developed in collaboration with third parties, such parties may not devote sufficient resources to these clinical trials or other preclinical studies of these candidates or conduct them in a timely manner;  \n• | we may face delays or other challenges associated with the availability and sourcing key raw materials and/or key components; and  \n• | we may encounter difficulties in developing product candidates related to our proprietary NanoPortal implant technology or difficulties associated with the long-term purity, potency, safety, or stability of our product candidates.  \n  \nFor example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM, a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of our miniature, 6-month, exenatide implant in patients with type 2 diabetes. In February 2024, Vivani announced a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio and the LIBERATE-1 trial was revised to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the exenatide implant in obese and overweight individuals. In addition, the Company announced that LIBERATE-1 would now be conducted in Australia and on September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to conduct the trial. Vivani anticipated initiation of LIBERATE-1 in 2024 and results from the study to be available in 2025.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**_We could experience delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials, which could result in increased costs or otherwise impair our research and development efforts._**\n\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials could significantly impact our drug development costs and otherwise impair our research and development efforts. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, delays related to: \n\n• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence one or more clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n• | reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective third-party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites;  \n• | obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct one or more clinical trials at a prospective site;  \n• | recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in one or more clinical trials; and  \n• | the failure of our collaborators to adequately resource our product candidates.  \n  \nFor example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In February 2024, Vivani announced a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio and the LIBERATE-1 trial was revised to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the exenatide implant in obese and overweight individuals. In addition, the Company announced that LIBERATE-1 would now be conducted in Australia and on September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to conduct the trial. Vivani anticipated initiation of LIBERATE-1 in 2024 and results from the study to be available in 2025.\n\n**_Our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation under the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign authorities, and must undergo extensive clinical testing that can be costly and time consuming, with no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates._**\n\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. regulatory agencies, the EMA, or comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the U.S., neither we nor any collaborators are permitted to conduct clinical testing in humans with our product candidates unless and until clearance is received to conduct clinical investigations under an IND from the FDA or receive similar authorizations abroad. For example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The LIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia and is anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024 after the HREC approval. In addition, marketing of such product candidates may not occur unless and until approval of a new drug application (“NDA”) from the FDA or similar approvals by comparable foreign regulatory authorities are secured. \n\nWith respect to one or more of our product candidates, we may seek regulatory approval in the U.S. by filing an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which is referred to as the 505(b)(2) pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. For our exenatide implants for example, we may intend to rely on certain information from Bydureon® and/or Bydureon BCise®, AstraZeneca’s exenatide extended-release injectable products. If we are unable to reference data generated for Bydureon® and/or Bydureon BCise®, additional clinical studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes (“CVOT”) study, may be required and would add significant additional costs and a significant delay in our efforts to seek and secure marketing approval. Further, if a CVOT study were conducted, there can be no assurance that the study would generate favorable results and support regulatory approval. \n\n**Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock**\n\n**_Because we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, we may not be able to attract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms._**\n\nVivani resulted from the August 2022 business combination of Second Sight and NPM. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of the Company’s lead program NPM-115, which is a miniature, six-month, GLP-1 implant candidate for the treatment of chronic weight management and the balance of the Company’s emerging portfolio of miniature, long-acting, GLP-1 implant candidates. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remained committed to identifying and exploring strategic options for the Neuromodulation Division (formerly Second Sight) that will enable further development of its pioneering neurostimulation systems to help patients recover critical body functions.\n\nBecause the NPM business did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our common stock, security analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we became a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering, because they may be less familiar with our company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media, and because we became public at an early stage in our development. The failure to receive research coverage or support in the market for our shares will have an adverse effect on our ability to develop a liquid market for our common stock.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n[](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2.[Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds](#TOC)**\n\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share, which was the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq or the 5-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq, each immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the common stock that occur after the date of the private sale transaction.

Organization and Business Operations\nVivani Medical, Inc. (“Vivani,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) is a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company which develops miniaturized,\nsubdermal implants utilizing its proprietary NanoPortal™ technology, which is designed to enable long-term, near constant-rate delivery of a broad range of medicines to\ntreat chronic diseases. Vivani uses this platform technology to develop and potentially commercialize drug implant candidates, alone or in collaboration with pharmaceutical\ncompany partners to address a leading cause of poor clinical outcomes in the treatment of chronic disease, medication non-adherence. According to the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, adherence is defined as the extent to which an individual’s behavior, including taking medications, corresponds to recommendations from a\nhealth care provider. An alarmingly high proportion of patients, approximately 50%, do not take their medicine as prescribed in the real world, a statistic that applies to both\ndaily oral as well as weekly injectable medicines. For example, a recent study has shown that 64% of patients taking Wegovy® (semaglutide injectable) discontinue therapy\nwithin the first year of treatment, a number that increases to 76% by the second year. Unfortunately, GLP-1 discontinuation may result in a quick reversal of the health\nbenefits in the majority of patients.\nAt Vivani, we are developing a portfolio of miniature, subdermal drug implant candidates that, unlike most oral and injectable medicines, are designed with the goal of\nguaranteeing medication adherence by delivering therapeutic drug levels for up to six months or longer. In addition, our aim is to minimize fluctuations in patients’ drug\nlevels through the use of our NanoPortal™ technology, which may improve the tolerability profiles for medicines, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, that produce side\neffects associated with fluctuating drug levels in the blood.\nVivani resulted from the business combination of Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (“Second Sight”) and Nano Precision Medical, Inc. (“NPM”). On August 30,\n2022, Second Sight and NPM completed their merger pursuant to which NPM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Second Sight and the combined company of NPM and\nSecond Sight was renamed Vivani Medical, Inc. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of its lead program NPM-115, a miniature, 6-month, GLP-1 implant\ncandidate for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients with one or more risk factors and further development of the balance of company’s miniature,\nlong-acting drug implant portfolio. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remains committed to identifying and exploring strategic options that will enable further\ndevelopment of its pioneering neurostimulation systems from legacy company Second Sight aimed at helping patients recover critical body functions.\nIn December 2022, we contributed our neurostimulation assets and certain liabilities to Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivani. Cortigent\nhas 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, all owned by Vivani. Cortigent is advancing the Company’s pioneering neurostimulation technology. In March 2023,\nVivani announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the proposed initial public offering of\nCortigent. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 was recently amended and filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024 to refresh the financial information and provide\nminor updates to the business.\nOn July 6, 2023, Vivani changed its state of incorporation from the State of California to the State of Delaware by means of a plan of conversion, effective July 5,\n2023. The reincorporation, including the principal terms of the plan of conversion, was submitted to a vote of, and approved by, Vivani’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders held on June 15, 2023. As part of this change of incorporation the Company established a par value of $0.0001 per share and all periods have been\nretroactively adjusted to reflect this change.\nAn Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for NPM-119 (GLP-1 implant) was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on July 14, 2023, to\nsupport the initiation of a first-in-human study of an exenatide implant in patients with type 2 diabetes. On August 18, 2023, FDA provided written notification that the\nstudy was on full clinical hold, primarily due to insufficient Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information to assess the risk to human subjects. After\nproviding additional information to sufficiently address the FDA's requests, the FDA lifted the clinical hold on NPM-119 on June 13, 2024 allowing for the proposed study\nto proceed. The primary objective of this first-in-human clinical study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 in type 2 diabetes patients.\nThe initial study design also incorporated Bydureon BCise® (exenatide injection) for comparison purposes.\n7\nOn August 25, 2023, the Company and Cortigent entered into an Amendment 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Transition Funding, Support and Services Agreement dated\nMarch 19, 2023 (the “TFSSA”). Pursuant to the TFSSA, Vivani has agreed to advance funds and provide or cause to be provided to Cortigent the services and funding\nintended to cover salaries and related costs, rent and other overhead in order to permit Cortigent to operate in substantially the same manner in which business operations of\nCortigent were previously operated by Second Sight, prior to the formation of Cortigent, which obligations will continue, in the case of the funding obligations, until the\nearlier of December 31, 2024 or the closing of an initial public offering of Cortigent (the “Funding Support Term”). Under the Amendment, Cortigent has agreed to repay\n$1,500,000 to Vivani at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term. In addition, at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term, Cortigent will enter into fai ve-year\npromissory note at 5% interest for $2,000,000 in favor of Vivani. Consequently, Vivani will forgive any remaining amounts due by Cortigent to the Company under the\nTFSSA. In October 2023, Vivani implemented a reduction-in-force to conserve cash that decreased Cortigent’s employees from 14 to 7 while continuing the ongoing\nOrion® clinical study and basic operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia was established to support studies of our product candidates.\nIn February 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical weight loss data with its exenatide implant that was comparable to semaglutide, the active ingredient in\nOzempic®/Wegovy®, and a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio. In a study of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, the exenatide implant generated\nweight loss of approximately 20% compared to a sham implant control after a 28-day treatment duration, comparable to the extent of weight loss observed in mice treated\nwith semaglutide injections (Ozempic®) in the same study.\nIn February, the Company also disclosed that semaglutide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NPM-139, another miniature, long term subdermal GLP-1 implant\nin development for chronic weight management further demonstrating our prioritization on obesity. NPM-139 also has the added potential benefit of once-yearly\nadministration.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (“Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor to purchase3 ,947,368\nshares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a\npurchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrant in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are\nexercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire three years following the date of issuance.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale AgreemenStM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which the Company\nmay offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its\nsales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement\nprospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement.\nOn May 28, 2024, Vivani announced the publication of positive weight loss data supporting the potential veterinary use of OKV-119, the company's miniature, long-\nacting GLP-1 implant under development with partner Okava Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Okava\") for the treatment of pre-diabetes, diabetes and obesity in companion felines.\nThe device is intended to be conveniently inserted under the skin during routine veterinary visits and is being designed to deliver six months of GLP-1 therapy with a single\nadministration.\nAs stated previously, on June 13, 2024, Vivani announced that the FDA cleared the IND and lifted the clinical hold for NPM1-19, the Company's miniature, six-month\nGLP-1 implant under development for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company provided an update of the clinical development plans for NPM1-15, the clinical program associated with the miniature, long-acting\nGLP-1 (high-dose exenatide) implant for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The Company has redesigned the First-in-Human study,\nLIBERATE-1, initially intended to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of its exenatide implant in patients with type2 diabetes, to evaluate the implant in\nobese and overweight patients. The study will enroll patients who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for eight weeks before being randomized to receive a\nsingle exenatide implant, weekly exenatide injections (Bydureon BCise®) or weekly semaglutide injections (Wegovy®) for a nine-week treatment duration. The\nLIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia and is anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of2 024, subject to regulatory clearance, with data from the study\nexpected in 2025.\nOn September 4, 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical liver fat results with its miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 implant currently under development chronic\nweight management in obese and overweight individuals and type 2 diabetes. The Company's GLP-1 (exenatide) implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat\nreduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. These liver fat data are consistent with published results from\nsimilar investigations with semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic® and Wegovy®.\n8\nOn September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to initiate its first in human clinical trial with a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1\n(exenatide) implant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. This clinical trial, known as LIBERATE-1™, is part of the NPM-115 program and will investigate the\nsafety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile of an exenatide implant. The trial also represents the first clinical application of the Company’s proprietary NanoPortal™\ndrug implant technology. LIBERATE-1 is designed to enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks\nfollowed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or\nweekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. The trial is expected to be initiated later this year with data\nprojected to be available in 2025.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock and warrants.\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no revenue that is developing novel medical devices, including limitations\non our operating capital resources. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur\noperating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the common stock and warrants to\npurchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock (the “Warrants”), to such investor at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in\nthe Offering. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance.\nSimultaneously, the Company also entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and such agreement, the “Placement Agency\nAgreement,” and together with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the “Agreements”), who acted as the sole placement agent for the Offering. The gross proceeds of\n$15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities\nPurchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity\nSecurities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole\ndiscretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company\nfiled a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0\nmillion shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligationsf or at least the next twelve months. Our\nability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to develop profitable operations through implementation of our business initiatives and/or raise additional\ncapital, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\nNote 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and following\nthe requirements of the SEC for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by GAAP can\nbe condensed or omitted. In our opinion, the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all\nadjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows for\nperiods presented. These statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying\nnotes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. The results of the interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or any other interim period or any future year or period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\n9\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported\namounts of expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to useful lives of\nlong-lived assets, stock-based compensation and evaluation of going concern. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that\nmanagement believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nOperating Segments\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating\ndecision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker, our Chief Executive Officer, reviews\nfinancial information presented for each of our segments. We have two reporting segments, specifically the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division. Neither\ndivision is revenue producing. The Biopharm Division includes activities from NPM and Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd. The Neurostimulation Division includes\nactivities from Cortigent and our subsidiary in Switzerland.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division incurred operating expenses of $5.7 million and\n$0.6 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net loss for the Biopharm Division was $5.4 million and for\nthe Neurostimulation Division was $0.6 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Biopharm Division and Neurostimulation Division incurred operating expenses of $16.6 million and $1.6\nmillion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net loss for the Biopharm Division was $15.7 million and for the Neurostimulation\nDivision was $1.7 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, total assets for the Biopharm Division and the Neurostimulation Division were $41.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nThe Company’s long-term assets are located in the United States.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are set forth in our financial statements for the year endedD ecember 31, 2023, included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.2 023-07, Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires\ndisclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss\nin assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\nEarly adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of\nthis ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.2 023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a\nreporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU\nwill result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\n10\nNote 3. Concentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We maintain cash,\ncertificates of deposit and money market funds with financial institutions that we deem reputable.\nForeign Operations\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 include assets amounting to approximately $27,000 and $0.1\nmillion, respectively, relating to our operations in Switzerland. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia\nwas established to support studies of our product candidates. Unanticipated events in foreign countries could disrupt our operations and impair the value of these assets.\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe authoritative guidance with respect to fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into\nthree levels and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers\nin and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that we have the ability to access as of the measurement date.\nFinancial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded securities and exchange-based derivatives.\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration\nwith observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds, and\nfair-value hedges.\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nFinancial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured\nusing present value pricing models.\nWe determine the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, we perform an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.\nCash equivalents, which include certificates of deposit and money market funds, are the only financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet, and are valued using Level 1 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any Level 1 and Level 2 financial\nliabilities or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or transfers in or\nout of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table summarizes assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nCertificates of deposit $ 7,112 $ 7,112 $ - $ -\nMoney market funds 11,112 11,112 - -\nTotal $ 18,224 $ 18,224 $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 18,629 $ 18,629 $ - $ -\nTotal $ 18,629 $ 18,629 $ - $ -\n11\nNote 5. Insurance Premium Financing\nIn September 2024, we entered into a finance agreement with First Insurance Funding in order to fund a portion of our insurance premiums for our professional liability\npolicies. The amount financed is approximately $426,000 and incurs interest at a rate of 7.2%. The Company is required to make nine monthly payments of approximately\n$47,000 through May 2025. The outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 was approximately $379,000 and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 6. Selected Balance Sheet Detail\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nProperty and equipment at cost:\nEquipment $ 3,789 $ 3,511\nFurniture and fixtures 367 354\nComputer software 30 7\nConstruction in progress - 299\nTotal property and equipment 4,186 4,171\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (2,542) (2,442)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 1,644 $ 1,729\nNote 7. Equity Securities\nWe are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock with 55,266,435 issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we are authorized to\nissue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with none issued as of September 30, 2024.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the common stock and Warrants to\npurchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrants in the Offering. The Warrants have an\nexercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the date of issuance. The Company also entered into a\nPlacement Agency Agreement with Maxim, who acted as the sole placement agent for the Offering. In connection with the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company\nagreed to pay Maxim an aggregate cash fee of 7.0% of the aggregate proceeds raised from the sale and issuance of the shares of common stock and accompanying warrants.\nPursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company also agreed to reimburse Maxim up to $65,000 for its legal expenses. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from\nthe Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other estimated offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase\nAgreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million.\nPursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, until 45 days following the closing of the Offering, the Company agreed not to issue (or enter into any\nagreement to issue) any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to certain exceptions. The Company has further agreed not to enter into an\nagreement involving a variable rate transaction until one year following the closing of the Offering. In addition, the Company’s directors and officers have entered into lock-\nup agreements with the Company pursuant to which each of them has agreed not to, for a period of 90 days from the closing of the Offering, offer, sell, transfer or otherwise\ndispose of the Company’s securities, subject to certain exceptions.\nAt-the-Market Sales Agreement\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion,\nshares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million\nshares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement.\n12\nThe Company may sell the common stock under the Sales Agreement (A) in privately negotiated transactions; (B) as block transactions; or (C) by any other method\npermitted by law deemed to be an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the\nNasdaq Capital Market or sales made into any other existing trading market for the shares of Common Stock. Jefferies will use commercially reasonable efforts to place the\nshares of common stock from time to time, based upon the Company's instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we\nmay impose). The Company will pay Jefferies a commission of up to three percent (3.0%) of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies under the\nSales Agreement, and also has provided Jefferies with customary indemnification rights. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain legal expenses and fees\nincurred by Jefferies in connection with the offering.\nThe Company is not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. The offering of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales\nAgreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all common stock subject to the Sales Agreement or (ii) termination of the Sales Agreement in accordance with\nits terms.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 287,970 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $504,000 as part of the Sales\nAgreement with Jefferies. The Company paid expenses of $344,000, resulting in net proceeds of $160,000.\nNote 8.

Stock-Based Compensation\nEquity Incentive Plan\nThe Vivani Medical, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) became effective on August 30, 2022. Under the 2022 Plan, 10,033,333 shares were\nauthorized for issuance at its effective date. The maximum number of shares with respect to which stock awards could be granted is offset and reduced by stock awards\npreviously granted under the 2022 Plan.

Upon achievement of the market condition,o ne-third of the award will vest, and\nthereafter, one-third of the award will vest on the first and second anniversary of the achievement date, subject to the recipient’s continued service through each applicable\nvesting date.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes total stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs, which is included in the statements of operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nResearch and development $ 275 $ 277 $ 757 $ 809\nGeneral and administrative 197 234 451 595\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 472 $ 511 $ 1,208 $ 1,404\n14\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $2.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 1.4 years. As of September 30, 2024, there was $0.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding RSUs that\nwill be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 year.\nStock Options\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted stock options to purchase 1,092,836 shares of common stock to certain employees and board members.\nThe options are exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of grant at a weighted average price of $1.57 per share, which was calculated at the fair value of our\ncommon stock on the respective grant date. The options generally vest over a period of four years.\nStock Options (Service Vesting)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,092,836 stock options subject to service vesting, were issued and valued at $1.4 million using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1,093,817 stock options subject to service vesting, were issued and valued at $1.1 million using\nthe Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The calculated value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the\nfollowing weighted-average assumptions.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 3.79% to 5.53% 3.99% to 4.45%\nExpected dividend yield -% -%\nExpected volatility 100% 100%\nExpected term 5.04 to 6.08 years 4.00 to 6.20 years\nStock Options (Market Conditions Vesting)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 200,000 stock options were granted and subject to market conditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15\nper share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the stock option to vest. These stock options with market conditions vesting were valued at $0.1\nmillion. The Company recognized the associated stock-based compensation expense of $20,000 and $20,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $61,000 and $46,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of these options subject to market\nconditions were valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation model with the following assumptions:\n● Beginning Stock Price. We utilized the Company’s publicly traded share price as of the Valuation Date as the beginning stock value. At the Valuation\nDate, the publicly traded common share price was $1.09 per share.\n● Drift Rate. In determining the value of the instrument in the risk-neutral framework, risk-free rates were estimated based on the applicable treasury rate\nfor the projection period. For each simulation, the term of the risk-free rate was based on the term from the Valuation Date through the latest date on\nwhich the award could vest (i.e., two years following the Performance Period End Date). Please note that, for the purposes of calculating the service\nperiod associated with the Subject Interest, the Company’s cost of equity was utilized as the drift rate.\n● Volatility. The total equity volatility (standard deviation) was based on a total equity volatility analysis.\n● Period. The period was measured as the number of years from the Valuation Date through the PSO expiration date (10 years following the date of\ngrant).\n● Dividends. The Company has not historically paid dividends. In addition, the Company does not expect to pay dividends going forward. As such,n o\ndividends were considered in our analysis.\n15\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 292,500 RSUs. These RSUs are subject to performance vesting criteria, based on market\nconditions which required our stock price to exceed $3.15 per share for three consecutive days in the four years from grant date for the RSUs to vest. The Company\nrecognized the associated stock-based compensation expense of $126,000 and $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$197,000 and $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024and 2023, respectively. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the performance-based\nrestricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and valued using a Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:\nNine Months Nine Months\nEnded September Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023\nRSUs Granted 292,500 402,500\nValuation date stock price $1.81 $0.93\nRisk-free interest rate 4.53% 4.13%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected volatility 100% 100%\nSimulation term 4 Years 1.1 Years\nThe steps involved in utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation in order to value the performance-based RSUs included the following:\n1. Projection of the Company’s Common Stock Value. The performance-based RSUs were measured based on the Company’s underlying common stock value over\nthe performance period (four years following the Valuation Date).\nAdditionally, we considered the two-year vesting period following achievement of the performance condition. Accordingly, our common stock value was simulated over\na six-year period to capture iterations through which the performance condition was satisfied on the Performance Period End Date. The analysis involved projecting our\ncommon stock value starting with our current common stock value. The forecasted stock price was based on the Geometric Brownian motion (“GBM”), and the Monte\nCarlo simulation generated random variables using the GBM to forecast our stock price on a daily basis over the specified period assuming 252 trading days per year. The\nMonte Carlo simulation for the PSO utilized the following assumptions:\n● Beginning Stock Price. As of the Valuation Date, we were a publicly traded company with an observable share price. Therefore, we utilized our\npublicly traded share price as of the Valuation Date as the beginning stock value.\n● Drift Rate. In determining the value of the instrument in the risk-neutral framework, risk free rates were estimated based on the applicable treasury rate\nfor the projection period. For each simulation, the term of the risk-free rate was based on the term from the Valuation Date through the latest date on\nwhich the award could vest (i.e., two years following the Performance Period End Date). Please note that, for the purposes of calculating the service\nperiod associated with the Subject Interest, our cost of equity was utilized as the drift rate.\n● Volatility. The total equity volatility (standard deviation) was based on a total equity volatility analysis.\n● Period. The period was measured as the number of years from the Valuation Date through the latest date on which the award could vest.\n● Dividends. We have not historically paid dividends nor do we expect to pay dividends going forward. As such,n o dividends were considered in our\nanalysis.\n2. Consideration of the Performance-Vesting Schedule. As previously discussed, our publicly traded common share price must equal or exceed the Stock Price Hurdle\namount of $3.15 over a 3-consecutive-trading-day rolling period on or before the Performance Period End Date. If such performance condition is achieved, 1/3 of the\naward shall vest on the Hurdle Achievement Date, 1/3 of the award shall vest one year following the Hurdle Achievement Date, and 1/3 of the award shall vest two years\nfollowing the Hurdle Achievement Date.\n3. Performance-Based RSU Value Conclusion. The proceeds from the vesting of common shares were then discounted to the Valuation Date using the applicable risk-\nfree rate, which is consistent with the assumption utilized to project stock prices in our Monte Carlo simulation. For the purpose of calculating the weighted service\nperiod associated with the Subject Interest, a separate simulation was performed using our cost of equity as the drift rate. The service period was then determined based on\nthe median Hurdle Achievement Date.\n16\nNote 10. Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without\nconsideration of potential dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effects of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities include\ncommon stock options, RSUs and warrants issued and outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (6,041) $ (6,782) $ (17,436) $ (19,626)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 55,247 50,837 54,161 50,757\nNet loss per common share, basic and diluted $ (0.11) $ (0.13) $ (0.32) $ (0.39)\nSince the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods presented, as the\ninclusion of all potential common stock equivalents outstanding would have been antidilutive.\nDuring the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share\nbecause including them would have been antidilutive (in thousands).\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options issued and outstanding 6,809 6,043\nUnvested restricted stock units issued and outstanding 695 403\nWarrants to purchase common stock 9,912 10,311\nTotal 17,416 16,757\nNote 11. Right-of-use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities\nWe lease certain office, laboratory, research and development space for our use. Leases with an initial term of1 2 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nLease costs are recognized in the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful life of the respective assets. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain\nany material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we used our estimated incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOn November 21, 2022, Vivani entered into a triple net lease agreement for a single building with4 3,645 square feet of space in Alameda, California. The stated term\nof the lease commenced on June 1, 2023 and terminates on September 30, 2033, ten years and four months. The lease term is based on the non-cancellable period in the\nlease agreement. There are two options to extend the lease, each for a term of five years; however, the extension options were not included in the measurement of the ROU\nasset and lease liability since it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such extension options. Payments increase annually from $2,676,311 to $3,596,784,\nor 124 monthly payments less the first four which are abated, totaling approximately $31.0 million. Vivani is responsible for insurance, property taxes and common area\nmaintenance charges. Vivani deposited $1.3 million to guarantee a letter of credit to secure the lease and this amount is recorded as restricted cash, long-term on the balance\nsheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The lease in Emeryville, California expired on September 30, 2023.\nOn February 1, 2023, we entered into a lease agreement, effectiveM arch 1, 2023, to sublease office space to replace Cortigent’s headquarters. Our rental payments\namount to $22,158 per month plus operating expenses, to lease 14,823 square feet of office space at 27200 Tourney Road, Valencia, California 91355. The sublease has a\nterm of two years and two months. We also entered into a lease for storage space on January 25, 2023, in the same building at a cost of $6,775 per month for a term of two\nyears and one month.\n17\nThe following table summarizes supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2024 2023\nAssets\nNon-current assets Right-of-use assets $ 18,383 $ 19,616\nLiabilities\nCurrent Current operating lease liabilities $ 1,385 $ 1,383\nLong-term Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 18,294 $ 19,313\nOperating lease cost was $0.8 million and $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.5 million and $1.9 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nVariable lease cost, comprising primarily of common area maintenance charges and taxes, for the operating lease was $0.1 million and $0.4 million during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes a maturity analysis of our lease liabilities showing the aggregate lease payments as ofS eptember 30, 2024 (in thousands except\nweighted average data):\nYear Ending December 31, Amount\n2024 $ 775\n2025 2,914\n2026 2,889\n2027 2,976\n2028 3,065\nThereafter 15,862\nTotal lease payments $ 28,481\nLess imputed interest (8,802)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 19,679\nWeighted average discount rate 8.40%\nWeighted average remaining lease term 8.90 years\nOther information related to leases are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 776 $ 375 $ 2,294 $ 1,134\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe maintain indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify them against liabilities that arise by reason of their status or\nservice as directors or officers, except as prohibited by applicable law.\nClinical Trial Agreements\nBased upon FDA approval of Argus II, which was obtained in February 2013, we were required to collect follow-up data from subjects enrolled in our pre-approval\ntrial for a period of up to ten years post-implant, which was extended through the year 2019. This requirement to collect follow-up data was halted in 2020 with FDA\napproval. In addition, we conducted three post-market studies to comply with U.S. FDA, French, and European post-market surveillance regulations and requirements and\nare conducting an early feasibility clinical study of Orion. We have contracted with various universities, hospitals, and medical practices to provide these services. Payments\nare based on procedures performed for each subject and are charged to clinical and regulatory expense as incurred. Total amounts expensed during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were $3,000 and $4,000, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $13,000 and $119,000,\nrespectively.\n18\nLitigation, Claims and Assessments\nOne opposition filed by Pixium Vision SA (“Pixium”) is pending in the European Patent Office challenging the validity of a European patent owned by Cortigent. The\noutcome of the challenge is not certain, however, if successful, it may affect our ability to block competitors from utilizing Cortigent’s neurostimulation patented\ntechnology. We believe a successful challenge will not have a material effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products, or otherwise have a material effect on\nCortigent’s operations.\nAs described in the Company’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) for a proposed\nbusiness combination with Pixium. In response to a press release by Pixium dated March 24, 2021, and subsequent communications between us and Pixium, our Board of\nDirectors determined that the business combination with Pixium was not in the best interest of our shareholders. On April 1, 2021, we gave notice to Pixium that we were\nterminating the MOU between the parties and seeking an amicable resolution of termination amounts that may be due, however no assurance can be given that an amicable\nresolution will be reached. We accrued $1,000,000 of liquidated damages as contemplated by the MOU in accounts payable as of March 31, 2021 and remitted that amount\nto Pixium in April 2021. Pixium indicated that it considered this termination wrongful, rejected the Company’s offers, but retained the $1,000,000 payment. On May 19,\n2021, Pixium filed suit in the Paris Commercial Court, and currently claim damages of approximately €5.1 million or about $5.6 million. We believe we have fulfilled our\nobligations to Pixium with the liquidated damages payment of $1,000,000. On December 8, 2022, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court has\nrendered its judgment, including finding that the Company’s termination of the MOU was not valid. In the judgment, the Company was ordered to pay to Pixium the amount\nof €2,500,000 minus a €947,780 credit for the $1,000,000 already paid for, a net amount payable of approximately €1,552,220. On May 24, 2023, the Company filed an\nappeal against the judgment from the Paris Commercial Court except in so far as such prior judgment dismissed (i) Pixium’s claim for the Company to pay it a sum of\n€480,693 relating to the alleged time spent by its teams, (ii) Pixium’s application to order the Company to pay it a sum of €1,500,000 in respect to alleged loss of\nopportunity and (iii) deducted the sum of $1,000,000 that we already paid Pixium and which Pixium retained converted into euros at the date of the judgment. Thereafter\nPixium filed its brief with Paris Court of Appeal and filed a cross-appeal on January 18, 2024. Meanwhile, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court\nhad opened safeguard proceedings against Pixium by judgment dated October 9, 2023, then in its judgment dated November 13, 2023, converted safeguard proceedings into\nreceivership, and in its judgment dated January 31, 2024, converted Pixium’s receivership proceedings to liquidation proceedings, the transfer plan being rejected. As a\nresult, Pixium’s liquidator intervened on behalf of Pixium in the pending proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal and filed its brief on March 21, 2024. The Company\nfiled its brief in reply with the Paris Court of Appeal on April 17, 2024. Proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal are pending. In parallel, since the Company has failed\nto enforce the judgment, Pixium has requested the pre-trial judge to strike out the Company's appeal for failure to enforce the judgment. The hearing took place on June 4,\n2024 and on October 23, 2024, the pre-trial judge issued his order, striking out Vivani's appeal for failure to enforce the decision. Within two years, Vivani will have to\nrequest that the case be reinstated on the court's docket, providing evidence that the judgment has been fully enforced or, at the very least, that an agreement has been\nreached. Failing this, the appeal proceedings will lapse.\nThe Company recorded a charge of $1,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to this matter but plans to continue its appeal against the preliminary\njudgment.\nWe are party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our results of\noperations, however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of\ndefense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nNote 13. Subsequent Event\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of\n3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share, which was the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock\non the Nasdaq or the 5-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq, each immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment for\nreverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the common stock that occur after the date of the private sale\ntransaction. The gross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5,000,000.00.\n19\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed financial statements\nand related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our products, plans and strategy for our business and related financing, contains forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our expected financial results in future periods.

We assume no\nobligations to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect actual outcomes.\nBusiness Overview\nVivani Medical, Inc. (“Vivani,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) is a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company which develops miniaturized,\nsubdermal implants utilizing its proprietary NanoPortal™ technology to enable ultra long-term, near constant-rate delivery of a broad range of medicines to treat chronic\ndiseases. Vivani uses this platform technology to develop and potentially commercialize drug implant candidates, alone or in collaboration with pharmaceutical company\npartners to address a leading cause of poor clinical outcomes in the treatment of chronic disease, medication non-adherence. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, adherence is defined as the extent to which an individual’s behavior, including taking medications, corresponds to recommendations from a health\ncare provider. An alarmingly high proportion of patients, approximately 50%, do not take their medicine as prescribed by their physician in the real world, a statistic which\nholds for both weekly injectable and daily oral medications. In addition, a recent study has shown that 64% of patients taking Wegovy® (semaglutide for weight\nmanagement) discontinue therapy within the first year, a number which increases to 76% by year two. The Company is developing a portfolio of miniature, subdermal drug\nimplant candidates that, unlike most oral and injectable medicines, are designed with the goal of guaranteeing medication adherence by delivering therapeutic drug levels for\nup to six months or longer. In addition, our aim is to minimize fluctuations in patients’ drug levels through the use of our proprietary NanoPortal™ implant technology,\nwhich may improve the tolerability profiles for medicines, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, that produce side effects associated with fluctuating drug levels in the blood.\nVivani resulted from the business combination of Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (“Second Sight”) and Nano Precision Medical, Inc. (“NPM”). On August 30,\n2022, Second Sight and NPM closed their merger pursuant to which NPM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Second Sight and the combined company of NPM and\nSecond Sight was renamed Vivani Medical, Inc. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of the company’s lead program NPM-115, a miniature, six-month, GLP-1\nimplant candidate for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients with one or more risk factors and further development of the balance of company’s\nminiature, long-term drug implant portfolio. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remained committed to identifying and exploring strategic options that will enable\nfurther development of its pioneering neurostimulation systems from legacy company Second Sight aimed at helping patients recover critical body functions.\nMoving forward, Vivani’s focus will be on the further development of NPM-115 and its emerging pipeline of innovative miniature, long-term drug implants to treat\npatients with chronic diseases and high unmet medical need. The origins of this business started while its current Vivani CEO and NPM co-founder Adam Mendelsohn and\ntwo of his graduate school colleagues, Kathleen Fischer and Lily Peng, at the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) and the University of California, Berkeley\n(“UCB”), entered business school competitions leveraging their growing knowledge of chemistry, drug delivery, and nanoscale technology to propose the development of\nnew miniature, biocompatible, drug implant prototypes capable of releasing therapeutic drug levels over an extended period of time. Based on their success and\nencouragement from professors and others, including medical device/pharmaceutical icon Alfred E. Mann, Dr. Mendelsohn and colleagues started NPM in 2009 and\noperations began in 2011 in an incubator on the UCB campus. Today, the Company has grown to3 6 full-time employees and its current headquarters and operations are\nlocated at 1350 South Loop Road, Alameda, California.\n20\nVivani’s implant technology, which we refer to as NanoPortal™, utilizes a space-efficient design that allows a miniaturized implant to provide many months of\ntherapeutic delivery of potent molecules. The technology has no moving parts, which is intended to minimize fluctuating drug delivery over the duration of the implant and\nis also tunable. Vivani has primarily been developing implant candidates around peptide therapeutics, but the technology has potential application across a wide range of\nmolecular types. The key innovative component of the technology is a biocompatible titanium-oxide nano-porous membrane which consists of millions of precisely sized\nnanotubes whose inner diameters represent the only path for drug molecules to exit the reservoir once the implant is fully assembled.\nIn December 2022, we contributed our neurostimulation assets and certain liabilities to Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivani. Cortigent\nhas 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, all owned by Vivani. Cortigent is advancing the Company’s pioneering neurostimulation technology. In March 2023,\nVivani announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the proposed initial public offering of\nCortigent. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 was recently amended and filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024 to refresh the financial information and provide\nminor updates to the business.\nOn July 6, 2023, Vivani changed its state of incorporation from the State of California to the State of Delaware by means of a plan of conversion, effective July 5,\n2023. The reincorporation, including the principal terms of the plan of conversion, was submitted to a vote of, and approved by, Vivani’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders held on June 15, 2023. As part of this change of incorporation the Company established a par value of $0.0001 per share and all periods have been\nretroactively adjusted to reflect this change.\nAn Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for NPM-119 (GLP-1 implant for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (“FDA”) on July 14, 2023, to support the initiation of the first-in-human study of NPM-119 in patients with type 2 diabetes. On August 18, 2023, FDA\nprovided written notification that the proposed NPM-119 study was on full clinical hold, primarily due to insufficient Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”)\ninformation to assess the risk to human subjects. Vivani provided the FDA with the requested CMC information and the FDA subsequently cleared the IND and lifted the\nfull clinical hold on June 13, 2024.\nOn August 25, 2023, Vivani and Cortigent entered into an Amendment No.1 (the “Amendment”) to the Transition Funding, Support and Services Agreement dated\nMarch 19, 2023 (the “TFSSA”). Pursuant to the TFSSA, Vivani has agreed to advance funds and provide or cause to be provided to Cortigent the services and funding\nintended to cover salaries and related costs, rent and other overhead in order to permit Cortigent to operate in substantially the same manner in which business operations of\nCortigent were previously operated by Second Sight, prior to the formation of Cortigent, which obligations will continue, in the case of the funding obligations, until the\nearlier of December 31, 2024 or the closing of an initial public offering of Cortigent (the “Funding Support Term”). Under the Amendment, Cortigent has agreed to repay\n$1,500,000 to Vivani at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term. In addition, at the conclusion of the Funding Support Term, Cortigent will enter into fai ve-year\npromissory note at 5% interest for $2,000,000 in favor of Vivani. Consequently, Vivani will forgive any remaining amounts due by Cortigent to the Company under the\nTFSSA. In October 2023, Vivani implemented a reduction-in-force to conserve cash that decreased Cortigent’s employees while continuing the ongoing Orion® clinical\nstudy and basic operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Vivani Medical Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia was established to support studies of our product candidates.\nIn February 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical weight loss data with a GLP-1 (exenatide) implant comparable to semaglutide, the active ingredient in\nOzempic®/Wegovy®, and a strategic shift to prioritize our obesity portfolio including our NPM-115 program. In a study of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, NPM1-15\ngenerated weight loss of approximately 20% compared to a sham implant control after a 28-day treatment duration, comparable to weight loss observed in mice treated with\nsemaglutide injections (Ozempic®/Wegovy®) in the same study. The Company also disclosed that semaglutide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NPM1-39, a\nminiature, subdermal GLP-1 implant in development for chronic weight management, with the added potential benefit of once-yearly administration.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor to purchase3 ,947,368 shares of common stock and warrants\nto purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying warrant in a registered direct offering. The\nwarrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire three years following the date of issuance. For additional\ninformation, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nOn March 6, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Daniel Bradbury to its Board of Directors. Under Bradbury’s leadership as CEO, Amylin\nPharmaceuticals, with partner Alkermes, secured the 2012 approval of Bydureon® (exenatide injection), the world’s first weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, a class of drugs\nthat now includes blockbusters Ozempic®, Trulicity® and Wegovy®.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement with an underwriter, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole\ndiscretion, shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through such underwriter as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the\nCompany filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to\n$75.0 million shares of common stock in accordance with the sales agreement. For additional information, refer to Note7 . Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n21\nOn May 28, 2024, Vivani announced the publication of positive weigh loss data supporting the potential veterinary use of OKV-119, the Company's miniature, long-\nterm GLP-1 implant under development with partner Okava for the treatment of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and obesity in companion felines. The device is intended to be\nconveniently inserted under the skin during routine veterinary visits and is being designed to deliver six months of GLP-1 therapy with a single implant.\nOn June 13, 2024, the Company announced that the FDA cleared the IND for NPM-119, a miniature, long-term subdermal GLP-1 implant under investigation to\naddress medication non-adherence and potentially improve tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes. The proposed first-in-human clinical study was designed to evaluate\nthe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of the exenatide implant versus the marketed exenatide injectable, Bydureon BCise®.\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company provided an update of the clinical development plans for NPM-115, the miniature, long-acting GLP-1 (high-dose exenatide) implant\nfor the treatment of chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. The Company has redesigned the first-in-human study, LIBERATE-1, to explore the\nsafety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an exenatide implant (initially using the same test article proposed for NPM-119) in obese and overweight patients. The study\nwill enroll patients who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for eight weeks before being randomized to receive a single exenatide implant, weekly exenatide\ninjections (Bydureon BCise®) or weekly semaglutide injections (Wegovy®) for a nine-week treatment duration. The LIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia and\nis anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending regulatory clearance, with data from the study expected in 2025.\nOn September 4, 2024, Vivani announced positive preclinical liver fat results with its miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 implant currently under development chronic\nweight management in obese and overweight individuals and type 2 diabetes. The Company's GLP-1 (exenatide) implant produced sham-implant adjusted liver fat\nreduction of 82% in an obese mouse model from a single administration with expected twice-yearly dosing. These liver fat data are consistent with published results from\nsimilar investigations with semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic® and Wegovy®.\nOn September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to initiate its first in human clinical trial with a miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1\n(exenatide) implant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. This clinical trial, known as LIBERATE-1™, is part of the NPM-115 program and will investigate the\nsafety, tolerability and full pharmacokinetic profile of an exenatide implant. The trial also represents the first clinical application of the Company’s proprietary NanoPortal™\ndrug implant technology. LIBERATE-1 is designed to enroll participants who will be titrated on weekly semaglutide injections for 8 weeks (0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks\nfollowed by 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks) before being randomized to receive a single administration of Vivani’s exenatide implant (n=8), weekly exenatide injections (n=8), or\nweekly 1 mg semaglutide injections (n=8) for a 9-week treatment duration. Changes in weight will be measured. The trial is expected to be initiated later this year with data\nprojected to be available in 2025.\nFunding and Liquidity\nCapital Funding\nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock and warrants. On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the\nSecurities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share (the “common stock”) and\nwarrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock (the “Warrants”), to such investor at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying\nwarrants in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire\nthree years following the date of issuance. Simultaneously, the Company also entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and such\nagreement, the “Placement Agency Agreement,” and together with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the “Agreements”), who acted as the sole placement agent for the\nOffering. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In\nconnection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $13.7 million. For additional information,\nrefer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale AgreemenStM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which the Company\nmay offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its\nsales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement\nprospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million shares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note7 .\nEquity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of $48,000 and 160,000 from issuing common stocks under\nthe Sales Agreement with Jefferies, respectively.\n22\nNon-Capital Funding\nFrom time to time, we receive grants that help fund specific development programs. Any amounts received pursuant to grants are offset against the related operating\nexpenses as the costs are incurred. Commencing in January 2018, we were awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) to fund the “Early Feasibility\nClinical Trial of a Visual Cortical Prosthesis”. The final year of the grant ended in March 2024, however the NIH issued us a no-cost extension allowing us to utilize the\nunfunded amount through March 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total grants offsetting against operating expenses were $0.2 million and\n$0.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we expect $70,000 will be available to offset future operating expenses.\nLiquidity\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have financed our working capital requirements through the\nrecurring sale of our equity securities. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the\nsatisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nTo finance our operations, we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently\nunknown to us, and we will need to seek additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other\nsources. However, we may be unable to raise additional capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain\nfunding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs, or we may be unable to\nexpand or maintain our operations, maintain our current organization and employee base or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our\nability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and/or develop profitable operations through implementation of our business\ninitiatives, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the\nrequirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission require management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting\npolicies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of those\njudgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in our Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Expenses. We recognize our operating expenses as incurred in two general operational categories: research and development and general and administrative.\nOur operating expenses also include a non-cash component related to the amortization of stock-based compensation for research and development and general and\nadministrative personnel. From time-to-time we have received grants from institutions or agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, to help fund some of the cost of\nour development efforts. We have recorded these grants as reductions to operating expenses.\n● Research and development expense consist primarily of employee compensation and consulting costs related to the design, development, and enhancements of our\ncurrent and potential future products, as well as internal and external costs associated with conducting clinical trials and maintaining relationships with regulatory\nagencies, as well as facilities costs, which include expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities and depreciation of equipment, offset by grant revenue received in\nsupport of specific research projects. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to\nincrease in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future products. We also expect to\nreceive additional grants in the future that will primarily offset research and development costs.\n● General and administrative expense consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology and\nadministrative personnel, as well as recruiting and professional fees, patent filing and annuity costs, insurance costs and other general corporate expenses, including\nrent and other facility related costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth\nof our business and operate as a public company.\n23\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, compared to $4.4 million\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million, or 5%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside\nservices from our neurostimulation division, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expense from our Biopharma division.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, compared to $2.7\nmillion during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 22%, was primarily attributable to staffing reductions along with reduced\noutside legal services from our neurostimulation division, in addition to reduced professional services from our Biopharma division.\nOther income, net. Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The change was not significant.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 7%, to $11.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $12.3\nmillion in the same period of 2023. The costs decreased was primarily attributable tos taffing reduction and reduced use of outside services from our\nneurostimulation division, partially offset by the increase in Alameda site facility expense from our Biopharma division.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense decreased $1.7 million, or 20%, to $6.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $8.5\nmillion in the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to staffing reductions along with reduced outside legal services from our neurostimulation\ndivision.\nOther income, net. Other income, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.8 million, compared to $1.1 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower interest associated with lower cash balances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have financed our working capital requirements through the\nrecurring sale of our equity securities. Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that our business is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of\nassets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance of 3,947,368 shares of the Company’s common stock, par\nvalue of $0.0001 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,947,368 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share and accompanying\nwarrants in a registered direct offering. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.80 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years\nfollowing the date of issuance. In connection with the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Maxim an aggregate cash fee of 7.0% of the aggregate\nproceeds raised from the sale and issuance of the shares of common stock and accompanying warrants. Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company also\nagreed to reimburse Maxim up to $65,000 for its legal expenses. The gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the Offering, before paying the placement agent fees and other\nestimated offering costs, were received on March 5, 2024. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company paid issuance costs of $1.3 million, resulting\nin net proceeds of $13.7 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion,\nshares of the common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Jefferies as its sales agent. Also on April 22, 2024, the Company filed a\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 3, 2024, including a sales agreement prospectus relating to the offering of up to $75.0 million\nshares of its common stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe estimate that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its planned obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our\nability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to develop profitable operations through implementation of our business initiatives and/or raise additional\ncapital, however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so.\n24\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no revenue that is developing a novel pharmaceutical product candidates and medical\ndevice candidates, including limitations on our operating capital resources and uncertain demand for our products. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative\noperating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. We expect our\noperating expenses to increase significantly as we continue our business operations, particularly as we prepare to and initiate our planned clinical trial and conduct our other\nresearch and development activities. Conducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete and we may never\ngenerate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval. We do not expect revenues until we are successful in completing the development and obtaining\nmarketing approval for our products. We expect expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate clinical trials, initiate new research\nand development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. If we are required to conduct additional nonclinical or\nclinical activities preclinical or IND-enabling activities such as additional pre-clinical, our overall expenditures would increase. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval,\nwe expect to incur significant additional expenses related to sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such product. In addition,\nour product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. We incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company in a regulated industry.\nUntil such time, if ever, we can generate product revenues, we anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings,\ngrants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed on\nfavorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, the ownership interests of\nsome or all of our common stockholders will be diluted, the holders of new equity securities may have priority rights over our existing stockholders and the terms of these\nsecurities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve\nagreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring\ndividends. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms. If,\nfor example, we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to\nour technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our inability to raise capital\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by $1.0 million from $22.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to $21.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Working\ncapital was $15.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $17.3 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.2 million. We use our cash and cash\nequivalents and working capital to fund our operating activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $15.0 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $17.4 million, partially\noffset by $0.7 million provided by a net change in operating assets and liabilities and non-cash items totaling $1.8 million for depreciation and amortization of property and\nequipment, stock-based compensation and lease expense.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $20.2 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $19.6 million and a net\nincrease in net operating assets of $3.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.4 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-\nbased compensation and lease expense.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, primarily attributable to\nthe purchase of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $14.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a securities purchase agreement\nwith an institutional investor. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Equity Securities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly\nreport on Form 10-Q.\nCash provided by financing activities was $110,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from exercise of options.\n25\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity without incurring significant risk. We invest cash in excess\nof our current needs in certificates of deposit and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the\ninterest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents consisted of certificates of deposit, money market\nfunds and restricted cash as collateral for our lease.\nExchange Rate Sensitivity\nThe majority of our operating expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars. We have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our operating expense\nexposure to foreign currencies, but we may do so in the future.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it\nfiles or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it\nfiles or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our\nCEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter endedS eptember 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are updating our internal control environment to address changes in our risks in financial reporting to\naccommodate our operating activities, staffing levels, and segregation of duties. Such changes may result in new or reduced controls.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,\nmaterial misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal\ncontrol over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can\noccur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can\nbe no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n26\nPART II-OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nOne opposition filed by Pixium Vision SA (“Pixium”) is pending in the European Patent Office challenging the validity of a European patent owned by Cortigent. The\noutcome of the challenge is not certain, however, if successful, it may affect our ability to block competitors from utilizing Cortigent’s neurostimulation patented\ntechnology. We believe a successful challenge will not have a material effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products, or otherwise have a material effect on\nCortigent’s operations.\nAs described in the Company’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) for a proposed\nbusiness combination with Pixium. In response to a press release by Pixium dated March 24, 2021, and subsequent communications between us and Pixium, our Board of\nDirectors determined that the business combination with Pixium was not in the best interest of our shareholders. On April 1, 2021, we gave notice to Pixium that we were\nterminating the MOU between the parties and seeking an amicable resolution of termination amounts that may be due, however no assurance can be given that an amicable\nresolution will be reached. We accrued $1,000,000 of liquidated damages as contemplated by the MOU in accounts payable as of March 31, 2021 and remitted that amount\nto Pixium in April 2021. Pixium indicated that it considered this termination wrongful, rejected the Company’s offers, but retained the $1,000,000 payment. On May 19,\n2021, Pixium filed suit in the Paris Commercial Court, and currently claim damages of approximately €5.1 million or about $5.6 million. We believe we have fulfilled our\nobligations to Pixium with the liquidated damages payment of $1,000,000. On December 8, 2022, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court has\nrendered its judgment, including finding that the Company’s termination of the MOU was not valid. In the judgment, the Company was ordered to pay to Pixium the amount\nof €2,500,000 minus a €947,780 credit for the $1,000,000 already paid for, a net amount payable of approximately €1,552,220. On May 24, 2023, the Company filed an\nappeal against the judgment from the Paris Commercial Court except in so far as such prior judgment dismissed (i) Pixium’s claim for the Company to pay it a sum of\n€480,693 relating to the alleged time spent by its teams, (ii) Pixium’s application to order the Company to pay it a sum of €1,500,000 in respect to alleged loss of\nopportunity and (iii) deducted the sum of $1,000,000 that we already paid Pixium and which Pixium retained converted into euros at the date of the judgment. Thereafter\nPixium filed its brief with Paris Court of Appeal and filed a cross-appeal on January 18, 2024. Meanwhile, the Company received notice that the Paris Commercial Court\nhad opened safeguard proceedings against Pixium by judgment dated October 9, 2023, then in its judgment dated November 13, 2023, converted safeguard proceedings into\nreceivership, and in its judgment dated January 31, 2024, converted Pixium’s receivership proceedings to liquidation proceedings, the transfer plan being rejected. As a\nresult, Pixium’s liquidator intervened on behalf of Pixium in the pending proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal and filed its brief on March 21, 2024. The Company\nfiled its brief in reply with the Paris Court of Appeal on April 17, 2024. Proceedings before the Paris Court of Appeal are pending. In parallel, since the Company has failed\nto enforce the judgment, Pixium has requested the pre-trial judge to strike out the Company's appeal for failure to enforce the judgment. The hearing took place on June 4,\n2024, and on October 23, 2024, the pre-trial judge issued his order, striking out Vivani's appeal for failure to enforce the decision. Within two years, Vivani will have to\nrequest that the case be reinstated on the court's docket, providing evidence that the judgment has been fully enforced or, at the very least, that an agreement has been\nreached. Failing this, the appeal proceedings will lapse.\nThe Company recorded a charge of $1,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to this matter but plans to continue its appeal against the preliminary\njudgment.\nWe are party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial\nstatements, however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of\ndefense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous material and other risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other\ninformation contained in this Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and in our other filings with the SEC. If any of the stated\nrisks actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could suffer materially. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could\ndecline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The material risks associated with our business were most recently discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that we filed on March 26, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such\nfiling, expect as noted below:\n27\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe will require substantial additional financing to pursue our business objectives, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. A failure to obtain this\nnecessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes\nyears to complete. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly\nas we conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we will incur significant costs\nassociated with sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution activities. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if required by the FDA, the EMA or other\nregulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or preclinical studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. For example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full\nclinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial\nto assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes\nand on September 26, 2024, we received regulatory approval to initiate a first in human clinical trial, known as the LIBERATE-1™, with the Company’s GLP-1 (exenatide)\nimplant in obese and overweight individuals in Australia. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. Because the design and outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical\ntrials are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amount of resources and funding that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and\ncommercialization of any product candidate. We are not permitted to market or promote any product candidate before it receives marketing approval from the regulatory\nauthorities. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations and pursue our business objectives.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Clinical Testing and Commercialization\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. We may incur additional costs and experience delays in developing our product\ncandidates, and our clinical development efforts may not yield favorable results.\nTo receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans\nto the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA, and comparable foreign authorities. We have not yet conducted clinical trials for our current product candidates and clinical testing\nof such product candidates may not yield results to support continued development or seeking regulatory approval. The development process is expensive, can take many\nyears and has an uncertain outcome. Failure can occur at any stage of the process. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the development\nprocess that could delay or prevent development and approval of our product candidates, including the following:\n• we may be unable to initiate or conduct planned clinical trials on our anticipatedt imelines, including as a result of failing to obtain any clearances necessary to conduct\nclinical trials or being subject to clinical holds that prevent continuation of such trials;\n• clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n• preclinical studies conducted with product candidates during clinical development to, among other things, evaluate their safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and\noptimize their formulation may produce unfavorable results;\n• patient recruitment and enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than anticipated;\n• costs of development may be greater than anticipated;\n• our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use or market acceptance, if approved;\n• if one or more product candidates are developed in collaboration with third parties, such parties may not devote sufficient resources to these clinical trials or other\npreclinical studies of these candidates or conduct them in a timely manner;\n• we may face delays or other challenges associated with the availability and sourcing key raw materials and/or key components; and\n• we may encounter difficulties in developing product candidates related to our proprietaryN anoPortal implant technology or difficulties associated with the long-term\npurity, potency, safety, or stability of our product candidates.\nFor example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have\ncleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM, a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of our miniature, 6-month, exenatide implant in\npatients with type 2 diabetes. In February 2024, Vivani announced a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio and the LIBERATE-1 trial was revised to\nassess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the exenatide implant in obese and overweight individuals. In addition, the Company announced that LIBERATE-1\nwould now be conducted in Australia and on September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to conduct the trial. Vivani anticipated initiation of\nLIBERATE-1 in 2024 and results from the study to be available in 2025.\n28\nWe could experience delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials, which could result in increased costs or otherwise impair our research and\ndevelopment efforts.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials could significantly impact our drug development costs and otherwise impair our research and development\nefforts. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a\nvariety of reasons, including, but not limited to, delays related to:\n• obtaining regulatory approval to commence one or more clinical trials;\n• reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective third-party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites;\n• obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct one or more clinical trials at a prospective site;\n• recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in one or more clinical trials; and\n• the failure of our collaborators to adequately resource our product candidates.\nFor example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on the LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have\ncleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month\nGLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In February 2024, Vivani announced a strategic shift to prioritize the Company's obesity portfolio and the\nLIBERATE-1 trial was revised to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the exenatide implant in obese and overweight individuals. In addition, the\nCompany announced that LIBERATE-1 would now be conducted in Australia and on September 26, 2024, the Company reported receiving regulatory approval to conduct\nthe trial. Vivani anticipated initiation of LIBERATE-1 in 2024 and results from the study to be available in 2025.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation under the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign authorities, and must undergo extensive clinical testing\nthat can be costly and time consuming, with no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are\nsubject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. regulatory agencies, the EMA, or comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the U.S., neither we nor any\ncollaborators are permitted to conduct clinical testing in humans with our product candidates unless and until clearance is received to conduct clinical investigations under an\nIND from the FDA or receive similar authorizations abroad. For example, on June 13, 2024, the FDA lifted the full clinical hold that they had previously implemented on\nthe LIBERATE-1 study on August 18, 2023 and have cleared us to initiate the LIBERATE-1TM Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics\nof NPM-119 (exenatide), our miniature, six-month GLP-1 implant in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The LIBERATE-1 study will be conducted in Australia\nand is anticipated to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024 after the HREC approval. In addition, marketing of such product candidates may not occur unless and until\napproval of a new drug application (“NDA”) from the FDA or similar approvals by comparable foreign regulatory authorities are secured.\nWith respect to one or more of our product candidates, we may seek regulatory approval in the U.S. by filing an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, which is referred to as the 505(b)(2) pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as\nsafety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. For our exenatide implants for example, we may intend\nto rely on certain information from Bydureon® and/or Bydureon BCise®, AstraZeneca’s exenatide extended-release injectable products. If we are unable to reference data\ngenerated for Bydureon® and/or Bydureon BCise®, additional clinical studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes (“CVOT”) study, may be required and would add\nsignificant additional costs and a significant delay in our efforts to seek and secure marketing approval. Further, if a CVOT study were conducted, there can be no assurance\nthat the study would generate favorable results and support regulatory approval.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nBecause we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, we may not be able to\nattract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms.\nVivani resulted from the August 2022 business combination of Second Sight and NPM. Vivani’s main priority is the further development of the Company’s lead\nprogram NPM-115, which is a miniature, six-month, GLP-1 implant candidate for the treatment of chronic weight management and the balance of the Company’s emerging\nportfolio of miniature, long-acting, GLP-1 implant candidates. In parallel, Vivani’s management team remained committed to identifying and exploring strategic options for\nthe Neuromodulation Division (formerly Second Sight) that will enable further development of its pioneering neurostimulation systems to help patients recover critical body\nfunctions.\nBecause the NPM business did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our common stock, security analysts of\nbrokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than\nthey might if we became a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering, because they may be less familiar with our company as a result of\nmore limited coverage by analysts and the media, and because we became public at an early stage in our development. The failure to receive research coverage or support in\nthe market for our shares will have an adverse effect on our ability to develop a liquid market for our common stock.\n29\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of 3,968,253\nshares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share, which was the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the\nNasdaq or the 5-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq, each immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment for reverse and\nforward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the common stock that occur after the date of the private sale transaction. The\ngross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5,000,000.00.\nItem 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\n(a) Private Sale Transaction\nThe information set forth below is included for the purpose of providing disclosure under “Item 1.01 - Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement,” and “Item 3.02 –\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities” of Form 8-K.\nOn November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a private sale transaction with one of its independent directors whereby the Company sold an aggregate of\n3,968,253 shares of the Company’s common stock to the director at a price of $1.26 per share, which was the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock\non the Nasdaq or the 5-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq, each immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment for\nreverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the common stock that occur after the date of the private sale\ntransaction. The gross proceeds from this private sale transaction were $5,000,000.00.\n(c) Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan Disclosure\nNo Rule 10b5-1 plans or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements were adopted, modified, or terminated by officers or directors of the Company, nor were there any\nmaterial changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company’s Board of Directors, during the quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\n30\nItem 6.
