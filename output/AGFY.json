The private placement is expected to close on November 21, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Benjamin Kovler, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, participated in the private placement to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $38.76 in compliance with applicable Nasdaq requirements.\n\n“This funding is a strong move for Agrify and our shareholders as we were able to raise approximately $26 million in a non-brokered deal (gross equals net),” said Chairman and Interim CEO Ben Kovler. “We plan to allocate this capital into opportunities within our circle of competence to benefit stockholders. We are excited about the opportunity set and current consumer trends in cannabis and hemp. The team continues to work hard to close the previously announced Señorita transaction, and it remains on track for closing at or around year end.”\n\nInvestors in the private placement will receive pre-funded warrants to the extent any investor’s beneficial ownership of Agrify common stock following the offering would exceed 4.99%.

A resale registration statement relating to the common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants will be filed with the SEC within forty-five days of the date when Agrify receives a demand for such registration from the investors.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the private placement.

The Transaction is expected to close before year end.\n\n“This is an exciting time for Agrify and our shareholders as our business has fresh energy, a strong balance sheet and new perspective on finding solutions in the cannabis industry,” said Agrify Interim CEO Ben Kovler. “We know Americans are demanding alternatives to alcohol and we believe that HDLT drinks will be a big part of the solution. I feel lucky to have found Joel and Charles and their amazing creation of Señorita. The brand needs capital and energy to handle the tidal wave of demand and Agrify’s balance sheet and team are ready.”\n\nSeñorita was designed and formulated by best friends and world-class winemakers Charles Bieler and Joel Gott, who collectively produce over two million cases of wine sold annually across multiple North American distribution outlets. Recognizing a growing generational demand for adult beverage alternatives, they founded Señorita in 2022 and launched the brand in the U.S. in 2023. Señorita offers consumers HDLT beverages that mirror well-known cocktails like a margarita – in two flavors – classic and mango. Known for its clean, fresh flavors and commitment to high-quality, natural ingredients, Señorita offers a low-sugar, low-calorie alternative to alcoholic beverages. Señorita’s HDLT products are currently offered in Canada and nine U.S. states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin, with plans for expansion across additional states. The product is also available direct to consumer where permissible under state law via the website [senoritadrinks.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zsIWgXzQ6gUDAU1LtfZP9fvPSQ2jA58iNm52UE3dAESxw5hC0BnYSkIOTBdqJ_aRxLssxyC467b3zYo9xNhsMJbig8WAF8me6LJ5tLsEYog=).\n\n“We started Señorita because we saw an obvious need in the market from American consumers demanding alcohol alternatives that would still provide a great experience,” Señorita co-founder Charles Bieler commented. “We love margaritas, so we focused on a small number of high-quality ingredients including agave, jalapeño and lime to make what we believe is the best tasting THC beverage on the market. As a result, we can’t keep up with demand - so when we met Ben and the team at Agrify we knew it was an amazing opportunity to take Señorita to the next level. We feel confident that Ben’s team, energy and expertise will guarantee the brand’s future success.”\n\n“As interim CEO of Agrify, my primary responsibility is to allocate capital in a way that generates an attractive return for shareholders,” added Kovler. “The data indicates a massive opportunity in the HDLT drink market, making this an attractive area to allocate capital. The good news is that Agrify’s balance sheet is well positioned to support the growth that Señorita and this beverage sector are experiencing. Working with Joel and Charles made sense from the start. They have an unbeatable entrepreneurial mindset that we need at Agrify to win in this next chapter of the cannabis story. I am excited for them to join the team as we work to close this transaction and focus on growing the business. We agree with Joel, Charles and American consumers when we say, ‘Más Señorita Por Favor’.”\n\nThe Transaction would involve the acquisition of assets involved in the operation of Señorita’s HDLT business. There can be no assurances that Agrify will reach a binding agreement and if it does, the terms could differ from those stated in this press release. In any event, Agrify will disclose the final deal terms and binding transaction documents in a future announcement and applicable filings with the Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nCurrently, Agrify has approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock outstanding and 6.3 million warrants. This Transaction would increase the shares outstanding through the issuance of a combination of shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants totaling 530,000 shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis. Agrify currently has approximately $17 million of debt consisting of $7 million with an entity affiliated with its former CEO and the recently announced $10 million convertible note issued to a subsidiary of Green Thumb Industries Inc.\n\n**About Agrify (Nasdaq: AGFY)**Agrify is a leading provider of branded innovative solutions for the cannabis industry in extraction, cultivation and more.

(“Green Thumb”) (CSE: GTII) (OTCQX: GTBIF), a leading national cannabis consumer packaged goods company and owner of RISE Dispensaries. Prior to this financing, the Green Thumb subsidiary acquired an ownership stake in Agrify through the purchase of common stock and warrants (the “Transaction”) from its outgoing Chairman and CEO Raymond Chang and outgoing Director I-Tseng Jenny Chan. Agrify will continue to operate as an independent business and was not a participant in the Transaction. Following the Transaction and Financing, Agrify retains the majority of its existing management team and all of its independent Directors.\n\nConcurrent with the Financing, Raymond Chang resigned as Chairman and CEO of Agrify and I-Tseng Jenny Chan stepped down from the Board. Following the acceptance of the resignations, the Agrify Board appointed Benjamin Kovler, Richard Drexler, and Armon Vakili to replace the outgoing Directors, bringing the total Board membership to six, the majority of whom are independent. In addition, Mr. Kovler was appointed to the roles of Agrify’s Chairman and Interim CEO following Mr. Chang’s resignation. Mr. Kovler, the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive of Green Thumb, will retain his leadership and responsibilities at Green Thumb, where he is focused on creating value for Green Thumb shareholders. Over his tenure at Green Thumb, he has successfully grown the company into one of the most profitable cannabis consumer packaged goods and retail businesses operating in the U.S. today. Mr. Drexler has over 40 years’ experience in corporate leadership roles as well as serving on several public company boards and audit committees. Mr. Vakili currently serves as Vice President of Strategic Initiatives & Partnerships at Green Thumb and has over a decade of experience in corporate affairs, mergers and acquisitions, private equity and finance.\n\nKrishnan Varier, a member of the Agrify Board, said, “This is great news for Agrify at a time when the Company needed a capital infusion. I am confident that this new investment from Green Thumb and Ben’s leadership will provide Agrify the necessary financing support and operational expertise to help position us for growth and long-term value creation for shareholders. We especially look forward to working with our new Board members, given their proven track records of successes. On behalf of our Board, I want to thank Raymond for his numerous contributions to the Company over the years. He has done a great job preparing us for our next phase of growth and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors.”\n\nBen Kovler added, “We believe Green Thumb’s financial investment and the new Directors’ experience can help Agrify unlock its untapped potential. Raymond and his team have worked hard to develop world-class proprietary technologies for the cultivation and extraction businesses, and we thank him for his support during this transition. Given Green Thumb’s thoughtful and prudent approach to capital allocation, we see significant opportunity ahead to assist in the creation of value for shareholders via Agrify’s non-plant touching assets. We are excited to be a significant owner of Agrify and I look forward to working with Krish, Brian and team right away.” \n\nOutgoing CEO, Raymond Chang, commented, “This is a great transaction for all our shareholders and employees. It has been an exciting journey for us, and I am incredibly proud of the entire Agrify team for what we have accomplished. I am confident that Agrify and the team are in experienced hands with its new leadership, and I am looking forward to focusing on my next chapter.”\n\n**About Agrify (Nasdaq: AGFY)** Agrify is a leading provider of innovative cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis industry, bringing data, science, and technology to the forefront of the market.
