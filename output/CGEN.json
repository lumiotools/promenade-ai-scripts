Feedback received from ovarian cancer experts supports advancing development of COM701 in an earlier disease setting. There is a need for durable and well tolerated treatment options in relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) patients who have received prior maintenance treatment and have no options for additional maintenance therapy. These patients are less immune compromised, than more advanced patients, providing the opportunity to harness the unique mechanism of action of COM701 to potentially change the disease trajectory and improve progression free survival. In addition, since there is no established treatment for these women, targeting this patient population to evaluate COM701's single agent activity and as a potential backbone for future combination treatments, presents a regulatory and commercial opportunity. We look forward to initiating an adaptive platform trial, starting with sub-study 1 randomizing patients with relapsed PSOC to single agent COM701 maintenance treatment or placebo in the second quarter of 2025. Since the median progression free survival of these patients is around 6 months, and this is a less competitive space than PROC for enrollment, we project having data from the interim analysis of sub-study 1 in the second half of 2026.\"\n\nDr. Cohen-Dayag continued, \"In the third quarter of 2024, we received a $30 million milestone payment from our partner Gilead following achieving FDA IND clearance for COM503, a differentiated antibody approach to harness cytokine biology for cancer therapeutics. We are on track to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for COM503 in advanced solid tumors, in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nDr. Cohen-Dayag added, \"Our partner, AstraZeneca, continued to advance development of rilvegostoming, their PD-1/TIGIT bispecific of which the TIGIT component is derived from COM902. In September 2024, AstraZeneca presented clinical data showing promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in trials evaluating rilvegostomig monotherapy in lung cancer and in combination with chemotherapy in gastric cancer at the WCLC and ESMO, respectively. They also initiated two additional Phase 3 trials bringing the total number of ongoing Phase 3 trials to five. We are eligible for future milestones and mid-single-digit tiered royalty payments, presenting a significant potential revenue source for the Company.\"\n\n**Next Planned Milestones**\n\n  * Q4 2024- on track to initiate Phase 1 study of COM503 in solid tumors\n  * Q2 2025- plan to initiate an adaptive platform trial starting with sub-study 1, randomizing patients with relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer ineligible for PARPi or bevacizumab to single agent COM701 maintenance treatment or placebo\n  * H2 2026- data from projected COM701 interim analysis from sub-study 1\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Cash:** As of September 30, 2024, Compugen had approximately $113.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long term restricted bank deposits, restricted cash and cash investments, compared with approximately $51.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash includes a $30 million milestone payment for COM503 IND clearance achieved in July 2024, which was subject to a 15% withholding tax and a $5 million clinical milestone payment from AstraZeneca. Compugen expects that its cash and cash related balances will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans into 2027. The Company has no debt.\n\n**Revenues:** Compugen reported approximately $17.1 million in revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to no revenues for the comparable period in 2023. The revenues reported reflect the recognition of a portion of the upfront and milestone payments from the license agreement with Gilead.\n\n**R &D expenses** for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $6.3 million, a decrease from $8.3 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is mainly due to the classification of COM503 R&D activities to cost of revenues coupled with lower COM503 expenses, mainly related to CMC.\n\n**G &A expenses** for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $2.6 million, compared to approximately $2.3 million for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n**Net Profit** for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $1.3 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of approximately $9.9 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n**Full financial tables are included below**\n\n**Conference call and webcast information**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 am ET to review its third quarter 2024 results and will be joined on the call by Dr. Oladapo Yeku, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Director of Translational Research, Gynecologic Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA and an investigator on the Company's PROC study, presented at SITC 2024. To access the live conference call by telephone, please dial 1-866-744-5399 from the U.S., or +972-3-918-0644 internationally.

COM701 in combination with COM902 (Fc reduced anti-TIGIT) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) resulted in durable objective responses in late-stage ovarian cancer patients typically not responsive to other immunotherapeutic agents,\" said Dr. Oladapo Yeku. \"There is a significant unmet need for effective, durable, and tolerable treatment options for patients with relapsed ovarian cancer. I look forward to discussing this data in Houston at SITC on Friday, November 8, 2024 and participating in further clinical development of COM701.\"\n\nAnat Cohen-Dayag, Ph.D. President, and Chief Executive Officer of Compugen added, \"We are highly encouraged by the consistency of the data between our two platinum resistant ovarian cancer studies demonstrating COM701 driven activity and safety profile in more than forty advanced and heavily pre-treated patients. We believe these data support our initial observation of the unique mechanism of action of COM701 translating into clinical benefit in patients with ovarian cancer. We are encouraged by feedback from ovarian cancer experts supporting advancing COM701 to an earlier setting of ovarian cancer therapy based on its overall activity, safety profile and durability demonstrated in advanced disease. There is a gap in care for women with platinum sensitive ovarian cancer, who respond to chemotherapy but are ineligible for or cannot tolerate additional maintenance treatment. These patients have a less compromised immune system, providing the opportunity to harness the unique mechanism of action of COM701 to potentially change the disease trajectory improving progression free survival.\"\n\nDr. Cohen-Dayag continued, \"Our development path in earlier lines of ovarian cancer will start by addressing this unmet need. I look forward to discussing these data and our future development plans including a fireside chat with Dr. Yeku, as part of our third quarter conference call that will take place on November 12, 2024, at 8:30 am ET.\"\n\nThe abstract is now available on the publication section of Compugen's website. The poster and short video presentation of the poster by Dr. Yeku will be available on the publication section of Compugen's website on Friday November 8, 2024.\n\nSITC 2024 abstract Data cut off: May 16, 2024 Note: The poster to be presented at SITC on November 8, 2024 will include additional data  \n---  \nTreatment | COM701+COM902+pembrolizumab  \nNo. patients | 23 (efficacy evaluable)  \nConfirmed ORR | 17.4% (1 CR, 3 PR)  \nConfirmed DCR | 43.5 %  \nImmune activation  | Increase in peripheral IFNg  \nSafety | Majority AEs GR ≤2  No GR 4/5 AEs 1 GR 3 event, serious immune related encephalopathy resolving following treatment with steroids  \n  \n**About Compugen** Compugen is a clinical-stage therapeutic discovery and development company utilizing its broadly applicable predictive computational discovery platform (UnigenTM) to identify new drug targets and biological pathways for developing cancer immunotherapies.
