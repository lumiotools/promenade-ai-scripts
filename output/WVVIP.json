INTRODUCTION\n1.1 General\nThis proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) and the accompanying proxy ballot are being furnished to the\nshareholders of Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the “Company”), as part of the solicitation\nof proxies by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board” or the “Board of Directors”) from shareholders of record\nof outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value (the “Common Stock”) on May 10, 2024, for use\nin voting at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders which will be conducted via online live audio webcast\non July 13, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), and any adjournments or postponements thereof (the “Annual\nMeeting”). There will not be a physical meeting location. The Annual Meeting can be accessed by visiting\nwvv.com/annualmeeting, where you will be able to participate in the meeting live and vote online. In order to be able\nto vote at the Annual Meeting, you will need your Control number, which is included on your proxy ballot if you are\na shareholder of record as of May 10, 2024 or included with the form and voting instructions you received from your\nbroker if you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name.” Please note that you will not be able to attend the\nAnnual Meeting in person. References to “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company” in this Proxy Statement mean\nWillamette Valley Vineyards, Inc.\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials\nfor the Shareholder Meeting to be Held on July 13, 2024\nPursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we have elected to provide internet access\nto our Proxy Statement and our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual\nReport”) rather than distributing hardcopies of the meeting materials. Consequently, most shareholders will not receive\npaper copies of our proxy materials. We will instead send to these shareholders an Important Notice Regarding the\nAvailability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting (the “Notice of Internet Availability”), with instructions\nfor accessing the proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement and Annual Report. This reduces postage, printing\nexpenses, and paper waste and is part of our efforts to eliminate unnecessary expenses and conserve the environment.\nThis Proxy Statement along with our Annual Report are available at wvv.com by clicking on the “Investor Relations”\ntab or wvv.com/annualmeeting. In accordance with SEC rules, our proxy materials posted on our website under the\n“Investor Relations” tab do not contain any cookies or other tracking features.\nAt the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following:\n(i) To elect three members of the Board of Directors with terms ending at the annual meeting in 2027;\n(ii) To ratify the appointment by the Board of Directors of Moss Adams LLP (“Moss Adams”) as the\nindependent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the year ending December 31,\n2024; and\n(iii) To transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournments\nthereof.\nThe Notice of Internet Availability, which contains information as to how shareholders can access this Proxy\nStatement, the Annual Report and a proxy ballot, is first being mailed to the Company’s shareholders on or about May\n31, 2024.\n1.2 Solicitation, Voting and Revocability of Proxies\nThe Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on May 10, 2024 as the record date for the determination of the\nshareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, only holders of record of Common\nStock at the close of business on such date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, with each such share entitling\nits owner to one vote on all matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, there were 2,099\nregistered holders holding 4,964,529 shares of Common Stock. The presence in person or by proxy, of a majority of\nthe total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to\nconstitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.\n6\nShareholders can vote on matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting in one of three ways:\nVoting online at the Annual Meeting\nThere will not be a physical meeting location. You will be able to vote online at the Annual Meeting by visiting\nwvv.com/annualmeeting. You will need your Control number, which is included on your proxy card if you are a\nshareholder of record as of May 10, 2024 or included with the form and voting instructions you received from your\nbroker if you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name.”\nVoting by mail:\nShareholders may vote by marking, signing and dating the proxy card and mailing it in the enclosed, prepaid and\naddressed envelope or return it to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, prior\nto the Annual Meeting.\nVoting on the Internet before the Annual Meeting.\nShareholders may vote their shares of Common Stock by going to www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions\nfor electronic delivery up until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on July 12, 2024. Shareholders should have their proxy card\nin hand when accessing the website.\nVoting by Telephone.\nShareholders may vote by calling the toll-free number listed on the proxy card from any touch-tone telephone and\nfollowing the instructions up until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on July 12, 2024. Shareholders should have their proxy\ncard in hand when calling.\nShareholders, who own their shares through a brokerage account or in other nominee form, should follow the\ninstructions received from the record holder to see which voting methods are available.\nEach enclosed proxy gives discretionary authority to the persons named therein with respect to any amendments or\nmodifications of the Company proposals and any other matters that may be properly proposed at the Annual Meeting.\nThe shares represented by all valid unrevoked proxies returned in time to be voted at the Annual Meeting will be voted\nin accordance with the instructions marked therein. EXECUTED BUT UNMARKED PROXIES WILL BE VOTED\nFOR THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTORS NAMED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT AND FOR THE EACH\nOF THE OTHER PROPOSALS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. If any\nother matter(s) properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxies solicited hereby will be exercised in accordance\nwith the reasonable judgment of the proxy holders named therein. If the meeting is adjourned or postponed, your\nshares will be voted by the proxy holders on the new meeting date as well, unless you have revoked your proxy\ninstructions before that date. Under Oregon law, shareholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights with respect to any\nof the proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement.\nA shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by filing a written notice of revocation with, or by\ndelivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date to: Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way,\nEdgewood, NY 11717, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting over the internet. Attending the Annual Meeting\nin and of itself will not revoke previously given proxies. In order to be effective, all revocations and later-filed proxies\nmust be delivered to the Company, care of Broadridge, at the address listed above not later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime, on Friday, July 12, 2024. A shareholder who attends the Annual Meeting need not revoke a previously executed\nproxy and vote online unless the shareholder wishes to do so. All valid, unrevoked proxies will be voted at the Annual\nMeeting.\nA proxy marked as abstaining will be treated as present for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum for\nthe Annual Meeting but will not be counted as voting on any matter as to which abstinence is indicated. If a quorum\nexists, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote, while action on a matter other\nthan the election of directors is approved if the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote favoring the action exceed the\nvotes cast opposing the action. Consequently, assuming the presence of a quorum, abstentions will not affect the\nresults of the matters to be affected at the Annual Meeting.\n7\nA Broker “non-vote,” which occurs when a broker or other nominee holder, such as a bank, submits a proxy\nrepresenting shares that another person actually owns, and that person has not given voting instructions on a non-\nroutine matter or matters to the broker or other nominee holder, will be treated as present for purposes of determining\nwhether there is a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Pursuant to applicable regulations, if a shareholder does not give\nvoting instructions to his/her broker, such broker will not be permitted to vote the shareholder’s shares of Common\nStock with respect to any of the Proposals described in this Proxy Statement, except for Proposal 2. We expect that\nbanks and brokers will be allowed to exercise discretionary authority for beneficial owners who have not provided\nvoting instructions with respect to the vote to ratify the Company’s selected independent registered public accounting\nfirm in Proposal 2.\nThe Company will pay the cost of its proxy solicitation. In addition to the use of the mails, proxies may be solicited\npersonally, by telephone or by email by directors, officers and employees of the Company, who will not be specially\ncompensated for such activities. Your cooperation in promptly completing and returning the enclosed proxy to vote\nyour shares of Common Stock will help to avoid additional expense.\n1.3 Directors and Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth the names of each of our executive officers, each of the members of the Board of\nDirectors, and each such person’s position with the Company and age.

All of our then-current directors\nattended the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.\n1.6 Independence\nThe Board of Directors has determined that each of our directors other than Mr. Bernau and Mr. Ellis is “independent”\nwithin the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the director independence standards of The\nNASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. (“NASDAQ”), as currently in effect. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has\ndetermined that each of the members of the Compensation and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors is\n“independent” under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the director independence standards of\nNASDAQ, as currently in effect. The Board of Directors does not have a separate standing Nominating Committee.\nConsistent with NASDAQ rules, only independent directors participate in meetings where the Board of Directors\nfunctions as the Company’s nominating committee. The independent directors held two meetings in 2023.\n1.7 Committees of the Board of Directors\nCompensation Committee\nThe Board of Directors has appointed a compensation committee (the “Compensation Committee), which reviews\nexecutive compensation and makes recommendations to the full Board regarding changes in compensation. Executive\nofficers do not play a role in determining executive compensation. The Compensation Committee does not delegate\nany of its duties, and it may use consultants in determining executive compensation. The Compensation Committee\nmet one time in 2023. The Compensation Committee did not engage the services of a compensation consultant for\n2023. The members of the Compensation Committee are Cara Pepper Day and Stan Turel. All members of the\nCompensation Committee are independent under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the director\nindependence standards applicable to compensation committee members of NASDAQ listed companies, as currently\nin effect. A copy of the Compensation Committee’s charter can be found on the Company’s website, www.wvv.com.\nAudit Committee\nThe Company has a separately designated standing audit committee (the “Audit Committee”) established in\naccordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The\nmembers of the Audit Committee are Sean Cary, Craig Smith, and Stan Turel. All members of the Audit Committee\nare independent as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the director independence\nstandards of NASDAQ, as currently in effect. The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf\nof the Board of Directors and reports to the Board of Directors the results of these activities, including the systems of\ninternal controls that management and the Board of Directors have established, our audit and compliance process and\nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee, among other duties, engages the independent public accountants retained\nas the registered public accounting firm, pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent\n10\npublic accountants, reviews with the independent public accountants the plans and results of the audit engagement,\nconsiders the compatibility of any non-audit services provided by the independent public accountants with the\nindependence of such auditors and reviews the independence of the independent public accountants. Mr. Smith is\ndesignated by the Board of Directors as the “audit committee financial expert” under SEC rules. The Audit Committee\nconducted four meetings in the year ended December 31, 2023 and each meeting was attended by at least two of the\ncommittee members. A copy of the Audit Committee charter can be found at our website, www.wvv.com.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nCraig Smith serves as the Audit Committee’s “financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. Mr. Smith is\nindependent as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the director independence standards\nestablished by NASDAQ, as currently in effect.\nCapital Development Committee\nThe Board of Directors has appointed a Capital Development Committee to review potential capital projects or\npurchases and make recommendations to the full Board of Directors. Additionally, the committee evaluates growth\nneeds of the Company and makes recommendation to management. The Capital Development Committee did not\nmeet in 2023. The members of the committee are Craig Smith, and Stan Turel.\nNominating Committee Functions\nThe Board of Directors performs the function of a nominating committee for selecting nominees for election as\ndirectors. Given its size, the Board believes that performing this function is a pragmatic and realistic approach.\nConsistent with NASDAQ rules, the independent members of the Board of Directors select and recommend to the full\nBoard of Directors for approval nominees for director positions. The Board then determines whether to approve of\nsuch nominations and present them to the Company’s shareholders for election to the Board of Directors. In seeking\nnominees, the Board looks for qualified candidates that will meet the oversight and financial expertise needs of the\nCompany. The Board also looks for nominees who will meet the independent qualifications necessary to meet current\nstandards of independence. While not maintaining a specific policy on Board diversity requirements, the Board\nbelieves that diversity is an important factor in determining the composition of the Board and, therefore, seeks a variety\nof occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board in order to obtain a range of viewpoints and perspectives and\nto enhance the diversity of the Board. The Board, functioning as nominating committee, annually evaluates the Board’s\ncomposition. This evaluation enables the Board to update the skills and experience they seek in the Board as a whole,\nand in individual directors, as the Company’s needs evolve and change over time and to assess the effectiveness of\nefforts at pursuing diversity.\nNominations of candidates by shareholders of the Company to be considered by the Board for membership on the\nBoard of Directors may be submitted if such nominations are made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the\nCompany’s Secretary. For more information, please see the information provided under the heading “Shareholder\nProposals and Nominations” below. The current nominees were selected by the independent members of the Board of\nDirectors, which nominees were ratified by the entire Board of Directors. The Company does not currently have a\ncharter or formal policy with respect to the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders. The\nreason for not having such a formal policy is that the Board believes the current approach has functioned well and\ntherefore no formal policy has been deemed necessary by the Board.\nExecutive Committee\nIn 1997 the Board appointed an Executive Committee. The members are: James Bernau, James Ellis, Craig Smith and\nStan Turel. The Executive Committee met three times in 2023.\n1.8 Leadership Structure of Board of Directors\nCurrently, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bernau, also serves as its Chairperson of the\nBoard. The Board believes the interests of all shareholders are best served at the present time through a leadership\nmodel with the same person holding the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board.\nMr. Bernau possesses an in-depth knowledge of the Company, its operations, and the array of challenges to be faced,\ngained through over 35 years of successful experience in the industry. The Board believes that these experiences and\n11\nother insights put Mr. Bernau in the best position to provide broad leadership for the Board as it considers strategy\nand as it exercises its fiduciary responsibilities to its shareholders.\nFurther, the Board has demonstrated its commitment and ability to provide independent oversight of management. All\ndirectors other than Mr. Bernau and Mr. Ellis have been determined by the Board to be independent, and all the\nmembers of each of the Compensation and Audit Committees are independent. Since each independent director may\ncall meetings of the independent directors and may request agenda topics to be added or dealt with in more detail at\nmeetings of the full Board, or an appropriate Board committee, the Board does not believe it necessary to have a lead\nindependent director.\n1.9 Role of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight\nThe entire Board and each of its standing committees are involved in overseeing risks associated with the Company.\nThe Board monitors the Company’s governance by regular review with management and outside advisors. The Board\nand the Audit Committees monitor the Company’s liquidity risk, regulatory risk, operational risk and enterprise risk\nby regular reviews with management and external auditors and other advisors. In its periodic meetings with the\nindependent accountants, the Audit Committee discusses the scope and plan for the audit and includes management\nin its review of accounting and financial controls, assessment of business risks and legal and ethical compliance\nprograms. As part of its responsibilities as set forth in its charter, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company’s\nexecutive compensation program and the associated incentives to determine whether they present a significant risk to\nthe Company. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company’s compensation\npolicies and procedures are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n1.10 Director Compensation\nThe following table sets forth information concerning compensation of the Company’s directors other than Mr. Bernau\n(who is an employee and whose compensation is addressed in the Summary Compensation Table) for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023:\nOther compensation for James L. Ellis includes a monthly stipend for ongoing consultation services as well as serving\nas administrator of any potential employee complaint that might rise to the board of directors’ level. The members of\nthe Board received cash compensation for their service on the Board in 2023 and are reimbursed for out-of-pocket and\ntravel expenses incurred in attending Board meetings.\nIn January 2009, the Board, upon recommendation of the Board’s Compensation Committee, who had sought outside\ncounsel regarding revision of the Company’s Board Compensation Plan, adopted the revised version of the revised\nWVV Board Member Compensation Plan. Under the terms of the Board Member Compensation Plan, any Board\nmember may elect not to receive any or all of the compensation components. In February 2024, the Board revised the\ncompensation for meetings. The basic elements of the revised plan are: $1,000 yearly stipend for service on the Board,\n$500 per Board meeting and $200 per committee meeting. A set per diem for expenses associated with meeting\nattendance, as well as a yearly wine allowance were also approved. Under the terms of the Board Member\nCompensation Plan, any Board member may elect not to receive any or all of the compensation components. The\nBoard also reserved the right to suspend the Board Member Compensation Plan at any time on the basis of prevailing\neconomic conditions and their impact on the company:\n12\nN a m e\nJa m e s L .

A copy of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on the\nCompany’s web site, www.wvv.com.

Furthermore, the Board has determined that, with the exception of the Executive Committee, each\nof the members of each of the committees of the Board is “independent” under the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe SEC and the director independence standards of NASDAQ, as currently in effect.\n2.7 Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s officers, directors and persons who own more than 10%\nof a registered class of the Company’s equity securities to file certain reports with the SEC regarding ownership of,\nand transactions in, the Company’s securities. These officers, directors and stockholders are also required by SEC\nrules to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that are filed with the SEC. Based solely on a\nreview of copies of such forms received by the Company and written representations received by the Company from\ncertain reporting persons, the Company believes that except for one Form 4 that was filed late by Jim Bernau, all\nSection 16(a) reports required to be filed by the Company’s executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders were\nfiled on a timely basis for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2.8 Audit Committee Report\nThe general purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the exercise of its fiduciary\nresponsibility of providing oversight of the Company’s financial statements and the financial reporting processes,\ninternal accounting and financial controls, the annual independent audit of the Company’s financial statements, and\nother aspects of the financial management of the Company.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS (PROPOSAL NO. 1)\nAt the Annual Meeting three directors are up for election to the Board of Directors, each for a term of three years. In\nNovember 2015 the Board of Directors amended the Company’s Bylaws to include, among other things, dividing\nboard membership into three groups with staggered terms. Therefore, all nominees have been divided into groups.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote for the election as directors the persons named below as\nnominees to serve on the Board of Directors for the term specified below:\nThe Board of Directors believes that the nominees will serve if elected as directors. There is no cumulative voting for\nelection of directors. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes; therefore, the two persons receiving the most votes,\neven if less than a majority of the votes cast, will be elected directors. Abstentions or failure to vote will have no effect\non the election of directors, assuming the existence of a quorum. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a\nvote FOR this proposal.\n4. RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS (PROPOSAL NO. 2)\nThe Audit Committee has appointed Moss Adams as independent auditors for the 2024 fiscal year. Moss Adams will\naudit the Company’s financial statements for the 2024 fiscal year and perform other services. While shareholder\nratification is not required by the Company’s by-laws or otherwise, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection\nof Moss Adams to the shareholders for ratification as a good corporate governance practice. If the shareholders fail to\nratify the selection, the Audit Committee may, but is not required to, reconsider whether to retain Moss Adams. Even\nif the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent\npublic accountant or auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest\nof the Company and its shareholders.\n18\nN\nCSS\no m in e e s :\nr a ig S m ithta\nn T u r e la\nr a h R o s e\nG r o u p N\nIIIIII\nu m b e r\nT e r mA Bn\nn\neu g in sa\nl M\n2 0 22\n0 22\n0 2\nFe\n444\noe l lotin wg\n:\nin g\nA\nTn en r m E nu\na l M\n2 0 22\n0 22\n0 2\nde\n777\ns a t\ne tin g :\nThe proposal will be approved if, assuming the existence of a quorum, more shares of the Company’s Common Stock\ncast on the proposal vote in favor of approval than vote against the proposal.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS OF DIRECTORS\n5.1 Shareholder Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year’s Proxy Statement\nTo be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement relating to next year’s annual meeting, a shareholder proposal\nmust be received at our principal executive offices no later than January 31, 2025. Such proposals also will need to\ncomply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in Company-\nsponsored proxy materials. Proposals should be addressed to the Company Secretary, Willamette Valley Vineyards,\nInc., 8800 Enchanted Way S.E., Turner, Oregon 97392. If the date of the next annual meeting is changed by more\nthan 30 days from the anniversary of this year’s annual meeting, then, to be considered for inclusion in the proxy\nstatement relating to next year’s annual meeting, notice of a shareholder proposal will need to be received by the\nCompany in a reasonable amount of time before the Company begins to print and send its proxy materials.\n5.2 Other Shareholder Proposals\nIf a shareholder wishes to present a shareholder proposal at our next annual meeting that is not intended to be included\nin the proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, the shareholder should give notice to our Company\nSecretary of such proposal. Such notice should be addressed to the Company Secretary, Willamette Valley Vineyards,\nInc., 8800 Enchanted Way S.E., Turner, Oregon 97392. According to the Company’s bylaws, in order to be timely,\nsuch notice must be in writing and received by the Company Secretary, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days\nprior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the 2023 Annual\nMeeting (no earlier than January 31, 2025, and no later than the close of business on March 2, 2025). However, if the\ndate of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the\nanniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, then notice by the shareholder to be timely must be delivered to\nthe Company’s Secretary not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual\nmeeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.\nTherefore, in the event a shareholder does not notify the Company of an intent to present a shareholder proposal at the\nCompany’s 2025 Annual Meeting within the timeframe outlined above, the Company’s management will have the\nright to exercise their discretionary authority to vote proxies received for such meeting with respect to any such\nproposal.\n5.3 Shareholder Director Nominations\nThe independent members of the Board of Directors select and recommend to the Board of Directors for approval\nnominees for director and committee member positions. The Board then considers the recommendation of these\ndirectors and decides which nominees to present to the Company’s shareholders for election to the Board of Directors.\nShareholders who wish to submit a proposed nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company for\nconsideration by the Board should send written notice to the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, Willamette Valley\nVineyards, Inc., 8800 Enchanted Way S.E., Turner, Oregon 97392 no later than March 2, 2025. Such notification\nshould set forth the name and address of such nominee or nominees and a description of all arrangements or\nunderstandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such person or\npersons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, as well as all information\nrelating to the proposed nominee as is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors\npursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act.

RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING\nThe Company intends to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and will publish final results\nwithin four business days of the Annual Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company will file with\nthe SEC.\n7. HOUSEHOLDING\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery\nrequirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a\nsingle proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as\n“householding,” potentially means extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Company\nhas implemented householding rules with respect to our shareholders of record. Additionally, a number of brokers\nwith account holders who are shareholders may be “householding” the Company’s proxy materials. If a shareholder\nreceives a householding notification from his, her or its broker, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple\nshareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder. Once a\nshareholder has received notice from his/her broker that they will be “householding” communications to such\nshareholders address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise.\nShareholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability at their address and would\nlike to request “householding” of their communications should contact their broker. In addition, if any shareholder\nthat receives a “householding” notification wishes to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability at his, her or\nits address, such shareholder should also contact his, her or its broker directly. Shareholders who wish to receive\nmultiple copies may also contact the Company c/o Company Secretary, Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc., 8800\nEnchanted Way S.E., Turner, Oregon 97392, Telephone Number: (503) 588-9463. The Company undertakes to\nprovide all such additional copies of the proxy materials upon request.\nShareholders of record sharing an address can request delivery of a single copy of annual reports to security holders,\nproxy statements, and notices of internet availability of proxy materials by contacting the Company at: c/o Company\nSecretary, Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc., 8800 Enchanted Way S.E., Turner, Oregon 97392.\n8. COST OF SOLICITATION\nThe cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to use of the mails, proxies may be solicited\npersonally or by telephone by directors, officers and employees of the Company, who will not be specially\ncompensated for such activities.\n9.

Bernau\nChairperson of the Board\nMay 31, 2024\n20\nANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nIntroduction – The Company was incorporated in May 1988 to produce and sell premium, super premium and ultra-\npremium varietals. The Company was originally established as a sole proprietorship by Oregon winegrower Jim\nBernau in 1983. The Company is headquartered in Turner, Oregon, which is just south of the state capitol of Salem,\nOregon. The Company’s wines are made from grapes grown in vineyards owned, leased or contracted by the\nCompany, and from grapes purchased from other vineyards. The grapes are harvested, fermented and made into wine\nprimarily at the Company’s winery in Turner, Oregon (the “Estate Winery” or “Winery”) and the wines are sold\nprincipally under the Company’s Willamette Valley Vineyards label, but also under the Domaine Willamette, Griffin\nCreek, Tualatin Estate, Pambrun, Maison Bleue, Natoma, Metis, Pere Ami and Elton labels. The Company also owns\nthe Tualatin Estate Vineyards and Winery, located near Forest Grove, Oregon (the “Tualatin Winery”).\nSegments – The Company has identified two operating segments: direct sales and distributor sales, based upon their\ndifferent distribution channels, margins and selling strategies. Direct sales include retail sales in the tasting rooms,\nwine club sales, online sales, on-site events, kitchen and catering sales and other sales made directly to the consumer\nwithout the use of an intermediary. Distributor sales include all sales through a third party where prices are given at a\nwholesale rate.\nProducts – Under its Willamette Valley Vineyards label, the Company produces and sells the following types of wine\nin 750 ml bottles: Pinot Noir, the brand’s flagship and its largest selling varietal, $30 to $120 per bottle; Chardonnay,\n$28 to $60 per bottle; Pinot Gris, $24 per bottle; Pinot Blanc, $30 per bottle; Sauvignon Blanc, $35 per bottle; Gruner\nVeltliner, $39 per bottle; Rose, $27 to $32 per bottle; Brut, $75 per bottle; Brut Rose, $75 per bottle; and Riesling,\n$19 per bottle (all bottle prices included herein are the suggested retail prices).

From 2009 to 2021, the number of U.S. wineries grew from 6,357 to 11,053, according to Statista,\nand consequently the wine industry can be considered one of the fastest-growing segments in agriculture. According\nto Wine Business Monthly’s February 2024 report, the number of US active wineries in 2023 stood at 11,620, showing\na 1% decrease compared to the peak in 2022. The total retail value of wine sales has increased from $26.3 billion in\n2000 to $78.4 billion in 2021, according to Statista. Additionally, 1.1 billion gallons of wine were consumed in 2021,\nan increase of 413 million from 2005 (Statista).\nThis growth rate has recently slowed and according to Silicon Valley Bank’s 2024 annual report premium wineries\nfaced a challenging landscape in 2023. According to this report, while the value of premium wine continued to grow,\nvolume sales were anticipated to finish lower for the year. Additionally, direct-to-consumer volume and value sales\ndeclined and tasting room visitation dropped for the second consecutive year and consumer demand for the overall\nwine category continued its decline, with fewer U.S. consumers opting for wine and choosing alternatives such as\nready-to-drink beverages, spirits, cannabis, or abstaining altogether.\nA 2023 study conducted by the Wine Market Council of 1,500 U.S. consumers identified a significant downward\ntrend in wine consumption attributed to a general reduction in alcohol consumption, primarily for health reasons.\nPreviously considered a “healthy” option on the Healthy Eating Pyramid, alcohol consumption is now cautioned\nagainst by organizations like the World Health Organization.\nOverall, we believe the industry is expected to stabilize in 2024 around the current levels. However, of concern,\nconsumption growth is mainly amongst those over 60 years old, with the most significant growth area among 70-80-\nyear-olds. Consequently, we believe future positive sales and growth will depend on the industry targeting younger\nconsumers. According to the State of the Wine Industry 2023 by Rob McMillan, younger wine consumers are not\nlimited by cost; instead, they seek something enticing to draw them in to learn more about wine, including but not\nlimited to health, sustainability, social values, and transparent labeling,\nThe Company’s Board of Directors and management believe the winery’s focus on integrity in winemaking, small\nscale, storied estate vineyards, environmental stewardship, support for community needs and participatory wine\nexperiences are reflective of the values of a number of prospective, developing wine enthusiasts.\nThe Oregon wine industry – Oregon is a relatively new wine-producing region in comparison to California and\nFrance. In 1966, there were only two commercial wineries licensed in Oregon. According to the Oregon Vineyard and\nWinery Report produced by University of Oregon’s Institute for Policy Research and Engagement (“UOIPRE”) in\n2022, the most recent year such data is available, the overall number of wineries increased from 1,058 to 1,116 with\nthe biggest increases coming from the Willamette Valley, which added 38. Planted acres of wine grape vineyards\nincreased by 2,588 acres from 41,899 to 44,487, an increase of 6%, 40,774 acres of which were harvested. Oregon\nwine grapes produced a 2022 crop with a total value of $330 million, an increase of 22% from 2021. Pinot Noir leads\nall varieties accounting for 71% of planted acreage and 67% of production. According to UOIPRE, Oregon case sales\nin 2022 were 5.7 million, an 8% increase from 2021.\nBecause of climate, soil and other growing conditions, we believe the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally\nsuited to growing superior quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregon’s\nPinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines have developed outstanding reputations, winning numerous national\nand international awards.\nHowever, Oregon has certain disadvantages as a wine-producing region. Oregon’s wines are lesser known to\nconsumers worldwide, and the total wine production of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French\ncompetitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give Oregon’s competitors certain\nfinancial, marketing, distribution, and unit cost advantages.\nFurthermore, Oregon’s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern in early autumn. If significantly above-\naverage rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially\ndiminished, thereby affecting that year’s wine quality.\nFinally, phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that feeds on the roots of grapevines, has been found in several commercial\nvineyards in Oregon. Contrary to the California experience, most Oregon phylloxera infestations have expanded very\nslowly and have done only minimal damage. Nevertheless, phylloxera does constitute a significant risk to Oregon\nvineyards. Prior to the discovery of phylloxera in Oregon, all vine plantings in the Company’s Estate Vineyard, in\n22\nTurner, Oregon, were with non-resistant rootstock. In 1997, the Company purchased Tualatin Vineyards at the\nTualatin Winery, which has phylloxera at its site. All current plantings are with, and all future planting will be with,\nphylloxera-resistant rootstock at that location. The Company takes commercially reasonable precautions in an effort\nto prevent the spread of phylloxera to other vineyards.\nAs a result of these factors, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the\nCompany believes that long-term prospects for growth in the Oregon wine industry are good. The Company believes\nthat over the next several years, the Oregon wine industry will grow at a faster rate than the overall domestic wine\nindustry, and that much of this growth will favor producers of premium, super premium and ultra-premium wines such\nas the Company’s Estate, Elton, Domaine Willamette, Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Griffin Creek brands.\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its\nability to: (1) grow and purchase high quality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium\nand ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant brand recognition for its wines, first in Oregon and then nationally\nand internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base of\ndirect to consumer sales. The Company’s goal is to continue to build on a reputation for producing some of Oregon’s\nfinest, most sought-after wines.\nBased upon several highly regarded surveys of the U.S. wine industry, the Company believes that successful wineries\nexhibit the following four key attributes: (i) focus on production of high-quality premium, super premium and ultra-\npremium varietal wines; (ii) achieve brand positioning that supports high bottle prices for its high quality wines; (iii)\nbuild brand recognition; and (iv) develop strong marketing advantages (such as a highly visible winery locations,\nsuccessful support of distribution, and life-long customer service programs).\nTo successfully execute this strategy, the Company has assembled a team of accomplished winemaking professionals\nand has constructed and equipped the Estate Winery into a 12,784 square foot winery that includes a 12,500 square\nfoot outdoor production area for the harvesting, pressing and fermentation of wine grapes.\nThe Company’s marketing and selling strategy is to sell its premium, super premium and ultra-premium cork-finished-\nwine through a combination of direct sales at the Company’s wineries, tasting room and restaurant locations in Oregon,\nWashington and California and sales through independent distributors and wine brokers who market the Company’s\nwine in specific targeted areas.\nTo remain competitive in the premium, super premium and ultra-premium market, the Company has embarked on a\nbrand expansion project including developing a brand and winery in the Walla Walla American Viticultural Area\n(“AVA”) under the names Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Metis. This future winery is expected to produce small vintages\nof Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals, under the Pambrun brand, and Syrah and other Rhone-varietals,\nunder the Maison Bleue brand, to compete in the ultra-premium wine market. The Company has released wines under\nthe Pambrun label beginning with the 2015 vintage year and Maison Bleue label beginning with the 2016 vintage.\nAdditionally, the Company has developed a single vineyard brand near Hopewell, Oregon adjacent to the current site\nof Elton Vineyards to produce wine under the Elton label. This brand produces primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay,\nalso for sale in the ultra-premium space. The Company has released wines under the Elton label beginning with the\n2015 vintage year. In 2020, the Company opened a microwinery featuring wine tasting and a custom blending\nexperience under the name Willamette Wineworks, in historic Folsom, California, and began selling wine under the\nbrand name Natoma. In 2022, the Company opened a sparkling wine facility and tasting room called Domaine\nWillamette, at Bernau Estate that features the Company’s sparkling wines, as well as its other reserve wines, and its\nbiodynamic farming practices.\nVineyards\nThe Company owns and leases approximately 1,018 acres of land, of which 801 acres are either currently planted as\nvineyards or are suitable for future vineyard planting. The vineyards the Company owns and leases are all certified\nsustainable by LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology) and Salmon Safe. At full production, the Company\nanticipates these vineyards would enable the Company to grow approximately 73% of the grapes needed to meet the\nwinery’s current production capacity of 654,000 gallons (275,000 cases) at its Estate Winery.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s acreage:\n23\nACRES TONS\nPre- Non-\nVineyard Name Total Producing Production Plantable Plantable 2023 2022\nOwned Vineyards\nWVV Estate 107 69 — — 38 216 206\nTualatin Estate Vineyard 107 61 — — 46 190 279\nIngram Vineyard 86 63 — — 23 178 364\nPambrun Vineyard 87 20 — 30 37 45 49\nLoeza Vineyard 62 20 15 23 4 133 104\nLouisa Vineyard 53 — — 25 28 — —\nMaison Bleue Vineyard 37 15 — 19 3 37 45\nBernau Estate 20 13 — — 7 68 33\nDayton Vineyard 40 — 15 19 6 — —\nLafayette Vineyard 36 — — 36 — — —\nJory Claim Vineyard 69 — 23 42 4 — —\nSub-Total 704 261 53 194 196 867 1,080\nLeased Vineyards\nPeter Michael Vineyard 79 69 — — 10 264 461\nMeadowview Vineyard 49 49 — — — 167 307\nElton Vineyard 59 54 — 2 3 187 198\nIngram Vineyard 110 93 — 17 — 286 463\nBernau Estate 17 9 — — 8 — —\nSub-Total 314 274 — 19 21 904 1,429\nContracted Vineyards*\nVarious 605 605 — — — 2,421 1,307\nTotal 1,623 1,140 53 213 217 4,192 3,816\n* Contracted acreage is estimated\nWVV Estate – Established in 1983, the Company’s Estate Vineyard (the “Estate Vineyard”) is located at the Winery\nlocation south of Salem, near Turner, Oregon. The Estate Vineyard uses an elaborate trellis design known as the\nGeneva Double Curtain. The Company has incurred the additional expense of constructing this trellis because it\ndoubles the number of canes upon which grape clusters grow and spreads these canes for additional solar exposure\nand air circulation. Research and practical applications of this trellis design indicate that it should improve grape\nquality through smaller clusters and berries over traditional designs.\nTualatin Estate Vineyard – Established in 1973 at the Tualatin Winery location near Forest Grove, Oregon, the\nCompany’s Tualatin Estate Vineyards is one of the oldest vineyards in Oregon. It was purchased by the Company in\n1997. A series of sale-leaseback transactions split the property into two additional vineyards, and the Company\ncontinues to lease and manage the Peter Michael Vineyard and Meadowview Vineyard, located adjacent to the\nTualatin Vineyard.\nIngram Estate and Elton Vineyard – In 2008, the Company purchased 86 acres near Hopewell, Oregon, for vineyard\nplantings. Adjacent to the purchased land is an additional 110 leased acres, also for vineyard development. The\nCompany believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Noir. The Ingram site is also adjacent to Elton\nVineyards, where the Company leases 54 acres of established vineyards.\nPambrun Vineyards – In 2015, the Company purchased 42 acres in the Walla Walla AVA near the town of Milton-\nFreewater, Oregon. Additionally, the Company purchased an additional 45 adjoining acres in 2017. The Company\nbelieves this site is ideal to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals. Wines produced from this\nvineyard are sold under the Pambrun label.\nLoeza Vineyard – The Company purchased 62 acres near Gaston, Oregon in 2014, for vineyard plantings, and believes\nthe site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. The site is close to Tualatin Vineyards which\nallows the Company to leverage existing crews for vineyard development and operations.\nLouisa Vineyard – The Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA in 2016 for vineyard plantings\nand believes the site is suitable for growing ultra-premium Pinot Noir.\nMaison Bleue Vineyard – The Company purchased approximately 37 acres in the new Rocks District of Milton-\nFreewater appellation near Milton-Freewater, Oregon in 2016. Grapes from this vineyard go to the Maison Bleue\nlabel.\n24\nBernau Estate – The Company purchased approximately 17 acres in Dundee, Oregon in January 2017 comprised of\n13 acres of producing Pinot Noir. Additionally, the Company added three acres through a lot line adjustment to add\nto the parcel. The Company leases 17 adjoining acres.\nDayton Vineyard – The Company purchased 40 acres in Dayton, Oregon in December 2016. The Company intends to\nplant vineyards at this location.\nLafayette Vineyard – The Company purchased 36 acres in Lafayette, Oregon in January 2018. The Company intends\nto plant vineyards at this location.\nJory Claim Vineyard – The Company purchased 69 acres south of Salem, Oregon in 2019. The Company intends to\nplant vineyards at this location.\nGrape Vines\nBeginning in 1997, the Company embarked on a major effort to improve the quality of its flagship varietal by planting\nPinot Noir clones that originated directly from the cool climate growing region of Burgundy rather than the previous\nsource of Napa, California, where winemakers believe the variety adapted to the warmer climate over the many years\nit was grown there.\nThese new French clones are called “Dijon clones” after the University of Dijon in Burgundy, which assisted in their\nselection and shipment to a U.S. government authorized quarantine site, and then two years later to Oregon\nwinegrowers. The most desirable of these new Pinot Noir clones are numbered 113, 114, 115, 667, 777 and 943. In\naddition to certain flavor advantages, these clones ripen up to two weeks earlier, allowing growers to pick before\nheavy autumn rains. Heavy rains can dilute concentrated fruit flavors and promote bunch rot and spoilage. These Pinot\nNoir clones were planted at the Tualatin Vineyards with phylloxera-resistant rootstock and the 667 and 777 clones\nhave been grafted onto seven acres of self-rooted, non-phylloxera-resistant vines at the Company’s Estate Vineyard.\nIn 2023, crop yields were roughly 14% below the 10-year average and the Company’s producing acres yielded\napproximately 867 tons of grapes.\nThe Company fulfills its remaining grape needs by purchasing grapes from other nearby vineyards at competitive\nprices. In 2023, the Company purchased an additional 2,421 tons of grapes from other growers. The Company cannot\ngrow enough grapes to meet anticipated production needs, and therefore contracts grape purchases to make up the\ndifference. Contracted grape purchases are considered an important component of the Company’s long-term growth\nand risk-management plan. The Company believes high quality grapes will be available for purchase in sufficient\nquantity to meet the Company’s requirements. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to\nplant more acres and purchase properties for future vineyards.\nManagement believes that the grapes grown on the Company’s vineyards establish a foundation of quality through\nthe Company’s farming practices, upon which the quality of the Company’s wines is built. Wine produced from grapes\ngrown in the Company’s own vineyards may be labeled as “Estate Bottled” wines. These wines traditionally sell at a\npremium over non-estate bottled wines.\nViticultural Conditions\nOregon’s Willamette Valley is recognized as a premier location for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine\ngrapes, particularly Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Riesling. The Company believes that the Estate\nVineyard’s growing conditions, including its soil, elevation, slope, rainfall, evening marine breezes and solar\norientation are among the most ideal conditions in the United States for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine\ngrapes. The Estate Vineyard’s grape growing conditions compare favorably to those found in some of the famous\nViticultural regions of France. Western Oregon’s latitude (42o–46o North) and relationship to the eastern edge of a\nmajor ocean is very similar to certain centuries-old wine grape growing regions of France, such as Burgundy.\nIn the Willamette Valley, permanent vineyard irrigation is generally not required. The average annual rainfall provides\nsufficient moisture to avoid the need to irrigate. However, if the need should arise, the Company’s Estate property\ncontains one water well which can sustain sufficient volume to meet the needs of the Winery and to provide auxiliary\nwater to the WVV Estate Vineyard for new plantings and unusual drought conditions. At the Tualatin Vineyard, the\n25\nCompany has water rights to a year-round spring that feeds an irrigation pond. The Company also has water rights at\neach of the Pambrun and Maison Bleue Vineyards.\nSusceptibility of vineyards to disease – The Tualatin Estate Vineyard and the adjacent leased vineyards are known to\nbe infested with phylloxera, an aphid-like insect, which can destroy vines.\nIt is not possible to estimate any range of loss that may be incurred due to the phylloxera infestation of the Company’s\nvineyards. The phylloxera at Tualatin Vineyard is believed to have been introduced on the roots of the vines first\nplanted on the property in the southern-most section Gewurztraminer in 1971 that the Company partially removed in\n2004. The remaining vines, and all others infested, remain productive at low crop levels. The Company is in the\nprocess of gradually replacing infested areas with new, phylloxera-resistant vines.\nWinery\nWine production facility – The Company’s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing\nup to 275,000 cases (654,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2023, the Winery\nproduced approximately 234,086 cases (556,700 gallons) of wine, primarily from its 2021 and 2022 harvest.\nThe Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging and bottling wine, as\nwell as an underground wine cellar and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area\nfor harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes. The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage building to\nstore its inventory of bottled product with a capacity of approximately 135,000 cases of wine. The production area is\nequipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in\ncompliance with environmental regulations.\nIn addition to the production capacity discussed above, the Tualatin Winery has 20,000 square feet of production\ncapacity. This adds approximately 28,000 cases (66,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The\ncapacity at the Tualatin Winery is available to the Company to meet any anticipated future production needs. The\nCompany also stores and ages product at the Domaine Willamette Winery location in Dundee, Oregon.\nMortgages on properties – The Company’s winery facilities at the Estate Winery are subject to two mortgages with\nan aggregate principal balance of $4,565,710 at December 31, 2023. The two outstanding loans require aggregate\nmonthly principal and interest payments of $62,067 for the life of the loans, at annual fixed interest rates of 4.75%\nand 5.21%, and with maturity dates of 2028 and 2032, respectively.\nWine production – The Company operates on the principle that winemaking is a natural, but highly technical, process\nrequiring the attention and dedication of the winemaking staff. The Company’s Winery is equipped with current\ntechnical innovations and uses modern equipment and software to monitor the progress of each wine through all stages\nof the winemaking process.\nThe Company’s historical annual grape harvest and wine production from 2005 to 2023 is as follows:\nTons of Tons of Total Tons Gallons of\nHarvest Grapes Grapes of Grapes Bulk Production Cases\nYear Grown Purchased Harvested Purchases Year Produced\n2005 1,107 25 1,132 - 2005 72,297\n2006 1,454 34 1,488 - 2006 81,081\n2007 850 896 1,746 - 2007 115,466\n2008 551 874 1,425 57,736 2008 121,027\n2009 1,033 1,100 2,133 74,954 2009 132,072\n2010 674 371 1,045 4,276 2010 110,224\n2011 718 609 1,327 9,620 2011 81,357\n2012 658 670 1,328 7,910 2012 91,181\n2013 755 1,020 1,775 6,257 2013 95,638\n2014 1,211 970 2,181 520 2014 108,958\n2015 1,266 1,012 2,278 - 2015 120,794\n2016 921 1,052 1,973 47,780 2016 141,416\n2017 1,631 1,622 3,253 15,900 2017 151,332\n2018 1,501 1,063 2,564 800 2018 164,590\n2019 1,572 1,046 2,618 - 2019 172,869\n26\n2020 1,031 1,470 2,501 13,173 2020 175,357\n2021 1,550 1,522 3,072 6,643 2021 206,954\n2022 2,509 1,307 3,816 22,000 2022 186,792\n2023 1,771 2,421 4,192 11,236 2023 234,086\nCases produced per ton harvested vary between years mainly due to the timing of when the cases are produced.\nSales and Distribution\nMarketing strategy – The Company markets and sells its wines through a combination of direct sales at the retail\nlocations, directly through mailing lists, and through distributors and wine brokers. As the Company has increased\nproduction volumes and achieved greater brand recognition, sales to out of state markets have increased, both in terms\nof absolute dollars and as a percentage of total Company sales.\nThe Company uses a variety of marketing channels to generate interest in its wines. The Company has a highly\nfunctional website, and maintains social media sites. The Company controls a database of customers for email and\ndirect promotions. The Company continues to submit its wines to competitions and state, regional and national media\nfor editorials and ratings.\nDirect sales – The Estate Winery is located on a visible hill adjacent to Oregon’s major north-south freeway (Interstate\n5), approximately 2 miles south of the state’s second-largest metropolitan area (Salem), and 50 miles in either direction\nfrom the state’s first and third-largest metropolitan areas (Portland and Eugene). We believe the unique location along\nInterstate 5 has resulted in a greater amount of wines sold at the Estate Winery as compared to the Oregon industry\nstandard. Direct sales from the Winery are a vital sales channel and an effective means of product promotion. The\nEstate Winery’s Tasting Room is open daily and offers wine tasting and education by trained personnel. The Company\noffers by-appointment private tours offering a behind-the-scenes look at the production process of the wines. The\nCompany has one of the largest wine club memberships in Oregon.\nIn September 2022, the Company opened a new sparkling winery, the Domaine Willamette Winery, located adjacent\nto Highway 99 in Dundee, Oregon, approximately 30 miles southwest of Portland, the state’s largest metropolitan\narea, and 25 miles northwest of Salem, the state’s second-largest metropolitan area. We believe the location of the\nDomaine Willamette Winery along Highway 99 in Dundee provides an ideal location for direct wine sales and wine\ntourism. Domaine Willamette Winery’s Tasting Room is open for wine tasting, restaurant service and education by\ntrained personnel. It features méthode traditionelle sparkling wines and a wine club. The Company offers by-\nappointment private tours, giving a behind-the-scenes look at sparkling wine production. Domaine Willamette\nWinery’s biodynamic garden is another attraction for visitors.\nIn 2014, the Company launched daily food pairings to accompany its wines. Led by the Winery Chef, the menu\nhighlights Pacific Northwest inspired dishes paired with the Company’s wines. The culinary offering has now\nexpanded to include “Pairings Wine Dinners,” which are community-style wine dinners hosted regularly throughout\neach month. In December 2021, the Company debuted a Pinot Noir Clonal Blending experience giving guests the\nability to be a winemaker for a day by crafting their own custom blends from barrel.\nThe Winery has developed a Winery Ambassador program, which connects its “Ambassadors” with customers\nthroughout the United States and offers personalized wine recommendations and easy ordering by phone or email.\nThe Company sells its wine through its own e-commerce website and direct ships where permissible.\nThe Company also operates eight additional tasting rooms at the following locations: (i) historic downtown\nMcMinnville, Oregon; (ii) at its Tualatin Vineyard, Oregon; (iii) Lake Oswego, Oregon; (iv) Happy Valley, Oregon;\n(v) downtown Walla Walla, Washington; (vi) Vancouver, Washington; (vii) Folsom, California, and (viii) Bend,\nOregon.\nThe Company holds various festivals and events at its locations throughout the year. Numerous private events,\ncharitable and political events are also held at Company locations.\nDirect sales produce a higher profit margin because the Company can sell its wine directly to consumers at retail\nprices, rather than to distributors at free-on-board prices. Sales made directly to consumers at retail prices result in an\nincreased profit margin equal to the difference between retail prices and distributor prices. For 2023 and 2022, direct\nsales contributed approximately 52.4% and 46.4% of the Company’s net sales, respectively.\n27\nDistributors and wine brokers – The Company uses both independent distributors and wine brokers, primarily to\nmarket the Company’s wines in specific targeted areas. Only those distributors and wine brokers who have\ndemonstrated knowledge of and a proven ability to market premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines are\nutilized. The Company’s products are distributed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, and there are three non-\ndomestic (export) customers. For 2023 and 2022, sales to distributors and wine brokers contributed approximately\n47.6% and 53.6% of the Company’s revenue from operations, respectively.\nTourists – Oregon wineries are a popular tourist destination with many bed & breakfasts, motels and fine dining\nrestaurants available. The Willamette Valley, Oregon’s leading wine region has approximately 69% of the state’s\nwineries and vineyards, is home to approximately 1,016 wineries. An additional advantage for Willamette Valley wine\ntourism is the proximity of the wineries to Portland (Oregon’s largest city and most popular destination). From\nPortland, tourists can visit the Willamette Valley winery of their choice in anywhere from a 45 minute to a two-hour\ndrive.\nThe Company believes the locations of the Estate Winery next to Interstate 5, and the Domaine Willamette Winery\nnext to Highway 99W, significantly increase direct sales opportunities to consumers. The Company believes these\nlocations provide high visibility for the Company to passing motorists, enhancing recognition of the Company’s\nproducts in retail outlets and restaurants. These wineries are each an approximately 45-minute drive from Portland,\nthe state’s largest metropolitan area.\nDependence on Major Customers\nHistorically, the Company’s revenue has been derived from thousands of customers annually. In 2023, sales to one\ndistributor represented approximately 14.5% of total Company revenue. In 2022, sales to one distributor represented\napproximately 17.5% of total Company revenue.\nCompetition\nThe wine industry is highly competitive. In a broad sense, wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and\nnonalcoholic beverages. Within the wine industry, the Company believes that its principal competitors include\nwineries in Oregon, California, and Washington, which, like the Company, produce premium, super premium, and\nultra-premium wines. Wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have\nsignificantly greater financial, production, distribution, and marketing resources than the Company. Currently, no\nOregon winery dominates the Oregon wine market. There are several Oregon wineries that are older, better established\nand have greater label recognition than that of the Company.\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the premium, super premium, and ultra-premium\nsegment of the wine industry are product quality, price, label recognition, and product supply. The Company believes\nit competes favorably with respect to each of these factors. The Company has primarily received “Excellent” to\n“Recommended” reviews in tastings of its wines and believes its prices are competitive with other Oregon wineries.\nLarger scale production is necessary to satisfy retailers’ and restaurants’ demand and the Company believes that\nadditional production capacity will be needed to meet estimated future demand. Furthermore, the Company believes\nthat its estimated aggregate production capacity of 720,000 gallons (303,000 cases) per year at its Estate and Tualatin\nlocations give it significant competitive advantages over most Oregon wineries in areas such as marketing, distribution\narrangements, grape purchasing, and access to financing. The current production level of most Oregon wineries is\ngenerally much smaller than the estimated production capacity level of the Company’s Wineries. With respect to label\nrecognition, the Company believes that its unique structure as a publicly owned company will give it a significant\nadvantage in gaining market share in Oregon, as well as penetrating other wine markets.\nGovernmental Regulation of the Wine Industry\nThe production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol\nand Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”) and the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (the “OLCC”).\nThe Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of these governmental agencies. Sale of the\nCompany’s wine is subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of a\nwinery for shipment to customers or for sale in its tasting room.\nIn December 2017, the federal government passed comprehensive tax legislation which included the Craft Beverage\nModernization and Tax Reform Act. This legislation modified federal alcohol tax rates by expanding the lower $1.07\nper gallon tax rate to wines up to 16.0% alcohol content with wines containing higher alcohol levels being taxed at\n28\n$1.57 per gallon. Additionally, the legislation provides for a $1 credit per gallon for the first 30,000 gallons produced;\n$0.90 for the next 100,000 gallons; and then $0.535 for up to 750,000 gallons. These modifications were effective\nJanuary 2020 and have since been made permanent.\nThe Company also pays the state of Oregon an excise tax of $0.67 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or\nbelow 14.0% and $0.77 per gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0% on all wine sold in Oregon. In addition,\nmost states in which the Company’s wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages.\nAs an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and, as a\nproducer of wastewater, by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The Company has secured all necessary\npermits to operate its business.\nPrompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities\noften consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being\nconsidered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any\nincrease in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of\nsuch products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic\nbeverages and may not be the same in every state.\nCosts and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws\nThe Company management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and\nprocesses designed to protect the environment, the public and consumers of its wine. Although much of the Company’s\nexpenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, the Company is regulated by various local, state and federal\nagencies regarding environmental laws. However, these regulatory costs and processes are effectively integrated into\nthe Company’s regular operations and consequently, do not generally cause significant alternative processes or costs.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 223 full-time employees and 123 part-time, or “on call”\nemployees. In addition, the Company hires additional employees for seasonal work as required. The Company’s\nemployees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes it maintains positive relations\nwith its employees.\nAdditional Information\nThe Company files Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K,\nand proxy statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains an internet site that\ncontains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company,\nthat file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. You may learn more about the Company by visiting the\nCompany’s website at www.wvv.com. All of the reports we file with the SEC are available from this website. All\nwebsites referred to herein are inactive textual references only, meaning that the information contained in such\nwebsites is not incorporated by reference herein.\nMARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nMarket Information\nThe Company’s Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “WVVI.”\nHolders\nAs of May 10, 2024, the Company had approximately 2,099 Common Stock stockholders of record. As some of our\nshares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by brokers on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the\ntotal number of beneficial holders of our Common Stock represented by these record holders.\nDividends\nThe Company has paid dividends on the Preferred Stock. The Company has not paid any dividends on its Common\nStock, and the Company does not anticipate paying any dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The\nCompany intends to use its earnings to expand its vineyards, winemaking, and customer service facilities.\n29\nEquity Compensation Plans\nThe Company had no equity compensation plan pursuant to which equity awards could be granted and no outstanding\noptions or other equity awards as of December 31, 2023.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be\nread in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and related notes. Some statements and information\ncontained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not\nhistorical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of\nimportant factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this\nreport, see “Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.”\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements, we\nbelieve the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgements and estimates used in the\npreparation of our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses Willamette Valley\nVineyards’ financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that are believed\nto be reasonable based upon the information available. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and\njudgments, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, leases, investments, income taxes,\nfinancing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical\nexperience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue – The Company’s principal sources of revenue are derived from direct sales and sales through distributors\nof wine. Distributor sales are recognized from wine sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. The Company’s\npayment arrangements with wholesalers provide primarily 30-day terms and, to a limited extent, 45-day, 60-day, or\nlonger terms for some international wholesalers. Direct sales through the Company’s tasting rooms are recognized at\nthe point of sales. Sales through the internet and wine club sales are recognized when the product has shipped to the\ncustomer.\nThe Company pays depletion allowances to the Company’s distributors based on their sales to their customers. The\nCompany sets these allowances on a monthly basis and the Company’s distributors bill them back on a monthly basis.\nAll depletion expenses associated with a given month are recognized in that month as a reduction of revenues. The\nCompany also reimburses for samples used by distributors up to 1.5% of product sold to the distributors. Sample\nexpenses are recognized at the time the Company is billed by the distributor as a selling, general and administrative\nexpense.\nAmounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling expenses are included in the net revenue.\nExpenses incurred for outbound shipping and handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative\nexpense.\nInventory – The Company values inventories at the lower of actual cost to produce the inventory or net realizable\nvalue. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and adjusts its production requirements for the\nnext twelve months based on estimated forecasts of product demand. A significant decrease in demand could result in\n30\nan increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In the future, if the Company’s inventory cost is\ndetermined to be greater than the net realizable value of the inventory upon sale, the Company would be required to\nrecognize such excess costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Therefore, although the\nCompany makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand, any significant\nunanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the ultimate selling price and cases sold and,\ntherefore, the carrying value of the Company’s inventory and its reported operating results.\nAdditionally, the Company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and marketability and if it determines that\nthe inventory is obsolete, or no longer suitable for use or marketable, the cost of that inventory is recognized in cost\nof sales at the time of such determination.\nVineyard Development – The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs prior to the vineyard land\nbecoming fully productive. These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor\nand materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises. Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is done\non a straight-line basis for the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years. The\nCompany regularly evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs. Amortization of vineyard development costs are\nincluded in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become a component of\ncost of goods sold.\nIncome Taxes – The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This requires the\nrecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences\nbetween the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The Company\nevaluates deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance against those assets, if available evidence suggests\nthat some of those assets will not be realized.\nThe effect of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more likely\nthan not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand an examination by tax authorities based on the\ntechnical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is\ngreater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As facts and circumstances change,\nmanagement reassesses these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.\nOverview\nThe Company generates revenue from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. The Company is\nexperiencing increased levels of competition in traditional wholesale to retail grocery distribution from large\nCalifornia based wineries that are acquiring, producing, and marketing Oregon branded wines. Direct to consumer\nsales primarily include sales through the Company’s tasting rooms and wine club. Direct to consumer sales provide a\nhigher gross profit to the Company due to prices received being closer to retail than those prices paid by wholesalers.\nThe Company continues to emphasize growth in direct-to-consumer sales through use of the Hospitality Center,\nopening new tasting rooms and growth in wine club membership. The Company had 11,541 wine club memberships\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, a net increase of 1,540 when compared to 2022. Additionally, the Company’s\nPreferred Stock sales since August 2015 have resulted in approximately 14,385 preferred stockholders, many of which\nthe Company believes are wine enthusiasts. When considering joint ownership, we believe these new shareholders\nrepresent approximately 21,577 potential customers of the Company. The Company also has approximately 3,177\nshareholders of Common Stock which we believe represent an estimated 4,765 potential customers when considering\njoint ownership. Additionally, the Company has made a significant investment in developing alternative wine brands,\nproducts, direct sales methods, and locations.\nPeriodically, the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, which primarily consist of inventory that does not meet\nCompany standards or is in excess of production targets. However, this activity is not a significant part of the\nCompany’s activities.\nThe Company sold approximately 191,619 and 187,371 cases of produced wine during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 4,248 cases, or 2.3% in the current year over the prior year. The increase\nin case sales was the result of more direct to consumer sales in 2023 when compared to 2022.\nCost of Sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and\nprocessing costs, bottling, packaging, warehousing, and shipping and handling costs associated with purchased\nproduction materials. For grapes grown at Company vineyards, costs include farming expenditures and amortization\nof vineyard development costs.\n31\nAt December 31, 2023, wine inventory included 131,647 cases of bottled wine and 785,363 gallons of bulk wine in\nvarious stages of the aging process. Cased wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months (and generally\nbefore the release date of the next vintage). The Winery bottled 234,086 cases during the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nResults of Operations\n2023 compared to 2022\nNet loss was $1,198,593 and $646,492, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of\n$552,101, or 85.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this\nincrease was a higher gross profit from additional sales revenue, being more than offset by higher operating expenses.\nThis was primarily related to higher tasting room expenses as a result of some locations being open for longer for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared to the previous year.\nNet loss applicable to common shareholders was $3,245,690 and $2,512,943, for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, an increase of $732,747, or 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year\nperiod. This increase was primarily driven by a higher net loss and higher preferred stock dividends.\nThe Company had net sales revenues of $39,136,114 and $33,934,081 for the years December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, an increase of $5,202,033, or 15.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period\nprimarily as a result of an increase in revenue from direct sales of $4,786,730, or 30.4% in 2023 compared to 2022,\nand an increase in revenue from sales to distributors of $415,303 or 2.3% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer retail sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-\nof-state sales to distributors. During 2023, revenues from retail sales increased 31.0%, revenues from in-state sales\ndecreased 5.0%, and revenues from out-of-state sales increased 6.1%, compared to 2022.\nDirect sales included $69,924 and $97,652 of bulk wine and grape sales in the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and represented approximately 52.4% and 46.4% of the Company’s total revenue for 2023 and\n2022, respectively, while the Company’s remaining revenues came from sales through distributors.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s revenue, excluding excise taxes, from the\nWinery’s operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nRetail sales $ 20,680,024 $ 15,786,241\nIn-state sales 5,686,517 5,987,410\nOut-of-state sales 13,131,363 12,374,881\nBulk wine/miscellaneous sales 69,924 97,652\nTotal revenue 39,567,828 34,246,184\nLess excise taxes (431,714 ) (312,103 )\nSales, net $ 39,136,114 $ 33,934,081\nRetail sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $20,680,024 and $15,786,241\nrespectively, an increase of $4,893,783, or 31.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nThe increase in retail sales revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly a result of increased revenues from new\nretail locations being open for longer during 2023.\nBulk Wine/miscellaneous sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $69,924 and $97,652,\nrespectively, a decrease of $27,728, or 28.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, over the prior year period.\n32\nIn-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $5,686,517 and $5,987,410,\nrespectively, a decrease of $300,893, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nOut-of-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $13,131,363 and $12,374,881,\nrespectively, an increase of $756,482, or 6.1%.\nThe Company pays alcohol excise taxes to both the OLCC and to the TTB. These taxes are based on product sales\nvolumes. The Company is liable for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per\ngallon basis. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton basis to the OLCC for the Oregon Wine\nBoard. The Company’s excise related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $431,714 and\n$312,103, respectively, an increase of $119,611, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nThis increase was due primarily to a larger crop processed and the timing of removals in 2023.\nCost of Sales was $16,578,986 and $15,119,985 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an\nincrease of $1,459,001, or 9.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, over the prior year period. This change was\nprimarily the result of increased sales and the mix of sales between direct and distributors between the two periods.\nGross profit was $22,557,128 and $18,814,096 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an\nincrease of $3,743,032 or 19.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was\ngenerally driven by an increase in sales revenues in 2023.\nThe gross margin percentage was 57.6% and 55.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nan increase of 2.2 percentage points, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase\nin the gross profit percentage was primarily the result of higher direct sales prices and more sales coming from direct\nto consumer sales in 2023.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $23,764,330 and $19,360,514 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $4,403,816, or 22.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the\nprior year period. This increase was primarily as a result of more sales coming from tasting rooms which have higher\nselling costs and from newer locations being open for longer in 2023.\nLoss from operations was $1,207,202 and $546,418 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nan increase of $660,784, or 120.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. This\nincrease included higher depreciation costs of $1,232,459 in 2023 mostly relating to the investment in new locations.\nInterest income was $27 and $5,496 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of\n$5,469 for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year. Interest expense was $594,106 and $367,745 for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $226,361, or 61.6%, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to the increase in\naverage loan balances in 2023 compared to the previous year.\nOther income, net, was $114,827 and $142,529 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a\ndecrease of $27,702, or 19.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nProvision for income tax benefit was $487,861 and $119,646 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, an increase of $368,215, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase\nin income tax benefit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily the result of a higher loss from operations in 2023 and\nan increase in the effective tax rate in 2023.\nLoss per common share after preferred dividends was $0.65 and $0.51 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, an increase of $0.14, or 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nThe primary reason for this increase was an increase in net loss and higher preferred stock dividends in 2023 compared\nto 2022.\nThe Company had cash balances of $238,482 at December 31, 2023, and $338,676 at December 31, 2022. The\nCompany had an outstanding line of credit balance of $2,684,982 at December 31, 2023, and $166,617 at December\n31, 2022. The Company had a bank overdraft of $393,416 at December 31, 2023, and no overdraft at December 31,\n2022.\nEBITDA\n33\nIn 2023, the Company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) increased 22.1%\nto $2,334,602 from $1,912,012 in 2022, primarily as a result of increased depreciation costs in 2023.\nEBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs.\nEBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America, referred to as “GAAP”, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or\nincome (loss) from operations as a measure of performance, nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities\nas a measure of liquidity. We use EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of our own operating results and as a\nbenchmark relative to our competitors. We consider it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income (loss) as a\nperformance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expense are not actual cash costs, and\ndepreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of\nthe underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities.\nEBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute\nfor analysis of our GAAP results as reported. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a\nsupplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to\ninvest in the growth of our business. See the Statement of Cash Flows set out in our financial statements included\nherein.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA for the\nperiods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ (1,198,593 ) $ (646,492 )\nDepreciation and amortization expense 3,426,977 2,315,901\nInterest expense 594,106 367,745\nInterest income (27 ) (5,496 )\nIncome tax benefit (487,861 ) (119,646 )\nEBITDA $ 2,334,602 $ 1,912,012\nSales\nWine case sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and ending inventory amounts for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, are shown in the following table:\nCases Sold Cases Sold Cases On-Hand\nVarietal/Product 2023 2022 December 31, 2023\nPinot Noir/Estate 17,334 16,079 21,554\nPinot Noir/Barrel Select 10,093 19,789 1,185\nPinot Noir/Founders Reserve 3,988 4,519 5,091\nPinot Noir/Special Designates 12,706 14,083 16,028\nPinot Noir/Whole Cluster 60,070 50,674 32,697\nPinot Gris 33,279 33,568 9,109\nRiesling 19,982 19,298 7,879\nChardonnay 5,191 5,010 5,246\nOther 28,976 24,351 32,858\nTotal 191,619 187,371 131,647\nApproximately 54% of the Company’s case sales during 2023 were of the Company’s flagship varietal, Pinot Noir.\nCase sales of Pinot Gris and Riesling follow with approximately 17% and 10% of case sales, respectively. The\nCompany sold approximately 191,619 and 187,371 cases of Company-produced wine during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This represents an increase of approximately 4,248 cases, or 2.3%, 2023\ncompared to 2022. The increase in case sales in 2023 compared to 2022 was the result of an increase in direct-to-\nconsumer case sales.\n34\nThe Company has three primary sales channels: 1) direct-to-consumer sales; 2) in-state sales to distributors; and 3)\nout-of-state sales to distributors. These three sales channels represent 52.4%, 14.4% and 33.2%, of total revenue for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. This compares to 46.4%, 17.5% and 36.1% of total revenue for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Miscellaneous and grape sales are included in direct-to-consumer sales.\nThe Company’s direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors offer comparable products to customers\nand utilize similar processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales\ngenerate a higher gross profit margin than national sales to distributors due to differentiated pricing between these\nsegments.\nWine Inventory\nThe Company had 131,647 cases of bottled wine on-hand at the end of 2023. Management believes sufficient bulk\nwine inventory is on-hand to bottle approximately 330,000 cases of wine in 2023, and that sufficient stock is on hand\nto meet current demand levels until the 2023 vintage becomes available.\nProduction Capacity\nCurrent production volumes are within the current production capacity constraints of the Winery, when including\nstorage capacity at the Tualatin Winery and utilization of temporary storage when appropriate. In 2023, 234,086 cases\nwere produced. We have the capacity to store and process about 275,000 cases of wine per year at the Estate Winery\nbut can expand that capacity by utilizing storage at the Tualatin Winery and temporary storage. Management continues\nto invest in new production technologies intended to increase the efficiency and quality of wine production. During\n2023, the Company did not utilize the wine production facilities at the Tualatin Winery but did utilize it for wine\nstorage. The Tualatin Winery has capacity to produce approximately 28,000 cases of wine. Management intends to\nfully utilize the production capacity at the Estate Winery before expanding into the Tualatin Winery.\nGrape Supply\nFor the 2023 and 2022 vintages, the Company grew approximately 42% and 66% of all grapes harvested, respectively.\nThe remaining grapes harvested were purchased from other growers. In 2023 and 2022, 18% and 8% of grapes\nharvested were purchased under short-term contracts, and 40% and 26% of grapes harvested were purchased under\nlong-term contracts, respectively. The Company considers short-term contracts to be for single vintage years and long-\nterm contracts to cover multiple vintage years.\nGrapes are typically harvested and received in September and October of the vintage year. Upon receipt, the grapes\nare weighed, and a quality analysis is performed to ensure the grapes meet the standards set forth in the purchase\ncontract. Based on the quantity of qualifying grapes received, the full amount payable to the grower is recorded to the\ngrapes payable liability account. Approximately 50% of the grapes payable amount is due in November of the vintage\nyear. The remaining amount is due in March of the following year. The grapes are processed into wine, which is\ntypically bottled and available for sale between five months and two years from the date of harvest.\nThe Company received $3,313,483 and $1,868,742 worth of grapes from long-term contracts during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company received $1,941,572 and $639,677 worth of grapes from\nshort-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total grapes payable was\n$2,446,233 and $1,208,673 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total grapes payable includes $1,357,649\nand $934,371 of grapes payable from long-term contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company plans to address long-term grape supply needs by developing new vineyards on properties currently\nowned or secured by lease. The Company has approximately 53 acres of vineyards that have been planted but are in\nthe pre-productive stage. We anticipate that these vineyards will begin producing grapes within the next one to three\nyears. The Company has approximately 213 acres of land that is suitable for future vineyard development. The\nCompany intends to seek out opportunities to acquire land for future grape plantings in order to continue to increase\navailable quantities, maintain control over farming practices, more effectively manage grape costs and mitigate\nuncertainty associated with long-term contracts.\nWine Quality\nContinued awareness of the Willamette Valley Vineyards brand and the quality of its wines was enhanced by national\nand regional media coverage throughout 2023 including the accolades below.\n35\nJames Suckling rated the Company’s 2021 Estate Pinot Noir 91 points, Dijon Clone Chardonnay 91 points and the\n2022 Pinot Gris 90 points.\nWine Enthusiast Magazine rated the Company’s 2021 Estate Pinot Noir 91 points, 2021 Dijon Clone Pinot Noir 90\npoints and 2021 Founders’ Reserve Pinot Noir 90 points. The Company’s 2022 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir 90 points,\n2022 White Pinot Noir 91 points, 2022 Maison Bleue Voltigeur Viognier 90 points, 2020 Métis Red Blend 92 points\nand Cellar Selection.\nSunset International Wine Competition awarded the Company’s 2022 Whole Cluster Rosé of Pinot Noir 94 points\nwith a Gold Medal.\nSip Magazine’s Best of the Northwest rated the Company’s 2022 Pinot Blanc a Double Gold.\nGlobal Fine Wine Challenge awarded the Company’s 2019 Griffin Creek Cabernet Franc and 2019 Domaine\nWillamette Brut both Gold.\nSeasonality\nThe Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue\nand net income. Typically, first quarter sales are the lowest of any given year, and sales volumes increase progressively\nthrough the fourth quarter mostly because of consumer buying habits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital balance of $18.4 million and a current ratio of 2.33:1. The\nCompany had cash balances of $238,482, at December 31, 2023.\nTotal cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,998,850, which resulted primarily\nfrom a net loss in 2023 as well as increased inventory and lease liabilities. This was partially offset by increased\ndepreciation, a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in grapes payable.\nTotal cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4,726,970, which primarily\nconsisted of cash used on construction activity and vineyard development costs.\nTotal cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6,615,626, which primarily\nconsisted of proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock and an increase in the line of credit and long term debt,\nbeing partially offset by the payment of a preferred stock dividend.\nIn December of 2005, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Umpqua Bank (the “Credit\nAgreement”) that allows borrowing up to $2,000,000 against eligible accounts receivable and inventories, as defined\nin the agreement. The revolving line bears interest at prime less 0.5%, with a floor of 3.25%, is payable monthly, and\nis subject to renewal. In July 2021, the Company renewed the Credit Agreement until July 31, 2023. In November\n2022, the Company increased the borrowing line up to $5,000,000. In July 2023 the line of credit was renewed for an\nadditional two years. The Company had an outstanding line of credit balance of $2,684,982 at December 31, 2023, at\nan interest rate of 8.0%, and an outstanding line of credit balance of $166,617 at December 31, 2022, at an interest\nrate of 6.5%. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was out of compliance with a debt covenant contained in the\nCredit Agreement. The Company has received a waiver from Umqua Bank waiving this violation until the next\nmeasurement date of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had a total long-term debt balance of $7,590,659 owed to AgWest, including\nthe portion due in the next year, exclusive of debt issuance costs of $105,989. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nhad a total long-term debt balance of $7,062,654, exclusive of debt issuance costs of $119,237. The debt with AgWest\nwas used to finance the Estate Hospitality Center and subsequent remodels, invest in winery equipment to increase\nthe Company’s winemaking capacity, acquire new vineyard land for future development and provide operating capital.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an installment note payable of $1,100,735, due in quarterly payments of\n$42,534 through February 2032, associated with the purchase of property in the Dundee Hills AVA.\n36\nThe Company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its existing credit facilities and\npreferred stock program will be sufficient to meet the Company’s foreseeable short and long-term operating needs.\nInflation\nThe Company’s management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the Company’s revenues or loss\nduring 2023 or 2022.\nRisk Factors\nThe following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss\ncertain material risks of the Company’s business as they appear to management at this time, however, this list is not\nexhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from time to time.\nAgricultural risks could adversely affect the Company\nWinemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses,\nincluding Grapevine Red Blotch Disease (“GRBV”), drought, frost and certain other weather conditions can affect the\nquantity of grapes available to the Company, decreasing the supply of the Company’s products and negatively\nimpacting profitability. In particular, certain of the Company’s vines are not resistant to phylloxera; accordingly, those\nvines are particularly at risk to the effects from an infestation of phylloxera. Phylloxera is a pest that attacks the\nrootstocks of wine grape plants. Vineyards in the United States, including some in Oregon and some owned by us,\nhave been infested with phylloxera. In particular, Tualatin Estate Vineyards have phylloxera. There can be no\nassurance that the Company’s existing vineyards, or the rootstocks the Company is now using in its planting programs,\nwill not become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera or that the phylloxera present at the Tualatin\nVineyards will not spread to our other vineyards. Pierce’s Disease is a vine bacterial disease. It kills grapevines and\nthere is no known cure. Small insects called Sharpshooters spread this disease. A new strain of the Sharpshooter was\ndiscovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north. The Company is actively supporting the\nefforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to prevent an infestation\nin its own vineyards. The Company cannot, however, guarantee that it will succeed in preventing contamination in its\nvineyards. Additionally, any future government restrictions created in connection with government attempts to combat\nphylloxera, GRBV or other pests or viruses may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production.\nOur operations are susceptible to changing weather patterns and other environmental factors\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and\nfrequency of natural disasters, such as hailstorms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. Any such extreme weather\ncondition could negatively impact the harvest of grapes at our vineyards and/or the other vineyards that supply us with\ngrapes for our wine. Oregon’s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern, particularly in early autumn. If\nsignificantly above-average rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often\nmaterially diminished, thereby affecting that year’s wine quality.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in weather patterns could adversely affect the Company, especially if such changes\nimpacted the amount or quality of grapes harvested. We cannot anticipate changes in weather patterns/conditions, and\nwe cannot predict their impact on our operations if they were to occur.\nAs weather patterns evolve, the Company’s vineyards, and contracted vineyards have become susceptible to potential\nsmoke damage as a result of wildfires within the region. In extreme events, smoke can produce effects on grapes that\nmake them unusable in the production of wine. The Company cannot predict smoke events, or the potential impact if\nsuch events were to occur.\nWe may not be able to economically insure certain risks\nThe Company maintains insurance policies to cover certain risks. However not all risks can be insured, or insured\neconomically, and there may be gaps in coverage that could expose the Company to liability should an event occur.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that coverage levels are adequate or that all of our insurers will be financially viable\nif we make a claim.\nLoss of key employees could harm the Company’s reputation and business\n37\nThe Company’s success depends to some degree upon the continued service of a number of key employees. The loss\nof the services of one or more of these key employees, including James W. Bernau, our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and John Ferry, our Chief Financial Officer could harm the Company and its reputation and negatively impact\nits profitability, particularly if one or more of the Company’s key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a\ncompeting company.\nThe Company’s ability to operate requires adequate funding\nThe Company’s cash flow from operations historically has not been sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the\nCompany’s operations. The Company has entered into a line of credit agreement to provide such funds and entered\ninto term loan arrangements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with all conditions under\nits credit facilities in the future or that the amount available under its line of credit facility or capital raises will be\nadequate for the Company’s future needs. Failure to comply with all conditions of the credit facilities, or to have\nsufficient funds for operations could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and stockholder value.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding long-term debt was approximately $7.6 million, with $2.7\nmillion drawn under its short-term line of credit. Additionally, the Company had notes payable to private parties of\napproximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCosts of being a publicly-held company may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage\nAs a public company, the Company incurs substantial costs that are not incurred by its competitors that are privately-\nheld. These compliance costs may result in the Company’s wines being more expensive than those produced by its\ncompetitors and/or may reduce profitability compared to such competitors.\nThe Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability\nThe wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. The Company’s wines compete in several premium\nwine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the\nBurgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well as Italy, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand and\nAustralia. The Company’s wines also compete with popular generic wines and with other alcoholic and, to a lesser\ndegree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by the Company’s independent\ndistributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. One result of this intense competition has been upward\npressure on the Company’s selling and promotional expenses. In addition, the wine industry has experienced\nsignificant consolidation. Many of the Company’s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, and public\nrelations resources than the Company does. In particular, wine production in the United States is dominated by large\nCalifornia wineries that have significantly greater resources than the Company. Additionally, greater worldwide label\nrecognition and larger production levels give many of the Company’s competitors certain unit cost advantages.\nCompany sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative\nbeverage producers’ costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully\ncompete with its current competitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage\nmanufacturers.\nThe Willamette Valley AVA value may be eroded by out of state competition who use it inappropriately or as fanciful\nmarketing\nWine grape growing regions in the United States are divided into AVA) by the United States Department of the\nTreasury’s TTB, based on distinguishable geographic features. The Oregon wine industry has historically embraced\nhigher standards for wine production than those established by the federal government and other states. As a result,\nwines from Oregon AVA’s, and specifically the Willamette Valley AVA, have achieved recognition for their quality\nwhen compared against other wines in their class. As a result, these Oregon wines are often sold at a higher price point\nthan wines not produced in Oregon. Because of this recognition, out of state competitors have inappropriately used\nOregon AVAs on bottles and packaging, claiming its use as fanciful marketing. Such use, inappropriate or otherwise,\ncould have a dilutive effect on the prestige of Oregon AVAs and ultimately the prices that can be charged for wines\nfrom Oregon AVAs as a result of reduced competitor quality and/or pricing.\nThe Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most\nof whom carry extensive product portfolios\n38\nNationwide, the Company sells its products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail\noutlets, restaurants, hotels, and private clubs across the United States and in some overseas markets. Sales to\ndistributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of the Company’s net revenue in the future. A\nchange in the relationship with any of the Company’s significant distributors could harm the Company’s business and\nreduce Company sales. The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors, except under certain\nlimited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause, as\ndefined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace distributors, poor performance of the Company’s\nmajor distributors or the Company’s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major distributors could harm the\nCompany’s business. There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to\npurchase the Company’s products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support.\nConsolidation at the retail tier, among club and chain grocery stores in particular, can be expected to heighten\ncompetitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain or reduce prices.\nLoss of the “Willamette Valley Vineyards” or “Willamette” trademarks could adversely affect the Company’s\ndistinction within the AVA\nThe Company has long held the federal trademarks “Willamette Valley Vineyards” and “Willamette”, as used in its\nwine brands. While it is lawful for wine producers meeting the federal and state requirements to list the “Willamette\nValley” AVA source of their wine grapes and wine on their labels, packaging and advertising materials, the Company\nhas enforced its trademarks on any unauthorized use as a wine brand.\nFluctuations in quantity and quality of grape supply could adversely affect the Company\nA shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity\nof the Company’s grape supply, including weather conditions, pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy\ngrapes on long and short term contracts and the number of vines producing grapes. Any shortage in the Company’s\ngrape production could cause a reduction in the amount of wine the Company is able to produce, which could reduce\nsales and adversely impact the Company’s results from operations. Factors that reduce the quantity of the Company’s\ngrapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount of wine the Company produces.\nDeterioration in the quality of the Company’s wines could harm its brand name and could reduce sales and adversely\nimpact the Company’s results of operations.\nContamination of the Company’s wines would harm the Company’s business\nThe Company is subject to certain hazards and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through\ntampering or otherwise, of ingredients or products. Contamination of any of the Company’s wines could cause it to\ndestroy its wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall, which could significantly damage the\nCompany’s reputation for product quality. The Company maintains insurance against certain of these kinds of risks,\nand others, under various insurance policies. However, the insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be\navailable at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to the Company and this insurance may not be adequate to cover\nany resulting liability.\nA reduction in consumer demand for premium wines could harm the Company’s business\nThere have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of\nbeverage alcohol products in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or\ngeneral decline in consumption in one or more of the Company’s product categories could occur in the future due to\na variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic conditions; increased concern about the health\nconsequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier\ndiet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; the increased activity\nof anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise and other taxes on beverage alcohol\nproducts. The competitive position of the Company’s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to\nachieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.\nChanges in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and business\nresults\nWine sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of\nthe economy, federal and state income tax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and\nstate tax laws, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer spending in these and\n39\nother regions can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that customers are willing to purchase at restaurants\nor through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for the Company’s\nproducts, limitations on the Company’s ability to increase prices and increased levels of selling and promotional\nexpenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact upon the Company’s sales and profit margins.\nIncreased regulation and/or taxation could adversely affect the Company\nThe wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the TTB and various foreign agencies, state liquor authorities\n(such as the OLCC) and local authorities. These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements,\ntrade, and pricing practices, permitted distribution channels, permitted and required labeling, and advertising and\nrelations with wholesalers and retailers. Any expansion of the Company’s existing facilities or development of new\nvineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions, and other\nlegal requirements. In addition, new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, income taxes, property\nand sales taxes or international tariffs, could negatively affect the Company’s financial condition or results of\noperations. Recently, many states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state\nalcohol excise taxes. Additionally, many states have revised, or are revising, statutes that broaden the definition of\nnexus to increase tax revenue from out of state businesses.\nNew or revised regulations, or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that new or revised regulations,\ntaxes or increased licensing fees and requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business\nand its results of operations and its cash flows.\nThe Company’s common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments.\nThe trading volume of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) on the NASDAQ Capital Market\n(“NASDAQ”) is consistently “thin,” in that there is not a great deal of trading activity on a daily basis. Because the\naverage active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to sell their shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other\npublicly traded companies.\nThe Company may face liabilities associated with the offer and sale of its Preferred Stock.\nIn August 2015, the Company commenced a public offering of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (the\n“Preferred Stock”) pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. The Company registered this transaction\nwith the securities authorities of the States of Oregon and Washington and, in November 2015, achieved listing status\nfor the Preferred Stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol “WVVIP”. The terms of our Preferred Stock are\nunusual for a company of our size, and we believe the structure of these securities and of the offering is not\ncommonplace among issuers. Federal and state securities laws impose significant liabilities on issuers of securities if\nthe related offering documents contain material misstatements of fact, or if the documents omit to state facts necessary,\nin light of the circumstances as a whole, to prevent the documents from being misleading. These liabilities can include\nrescission liability to the purchasers of the securities, as well as potential enforcement liability that could give rise to\ncivil money penalties. Securities litigation can be extraordinarily expensive and protracted, and if we are accused of\nmisstatements or omissions in our offering documents, we may face economic harms and management distractions\nregardless of the ultimate outcome of any such litigation. Further, if we ultimately are adjudged to have actually made\na material misstatement or omission, the Company may be liable for the repayment of the purchase price of the related\nsecurities, plus interest from the date of purchase. Any one or more of these events or circumstances would have a\nmaterial adverse impact upon our business, financial condition or results of operations, and may make it more difficult\nor more expensive to undertake capital-raising efforts in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to pay accumulated dividends on its Preferred Stock.\nThe Company’s Preferred Stock bears a cumulative 5.3% dividend based upon the original issue price, or $0.22 per\nshare per annum. However, prior to the declaration and payment of dividends our board of directors must determine,\namong other things, that funds are available out of the surplus of the Company and that the payment would not render\nus insolvent or compromise our ability to pay our obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business.\nAdditionally, our existing credit facility limits, and future debt obligations in the future may limit, both our legal and\nour practical ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result, although the Preferred Stock will continue to earn a\nright to receive dividends, the Company’s ability to pay dividends will depend, among other things, upon our ability\n40\nto generate excess cash. However, although shares of our Preferred Stock will earn cumulative dividends, unpaid\ndividends will not, themselves, accumulate (as might compounding interest on a debt security, for example).\nAs the Company’s sales revenues are dependent in part upon the purchases made by and continued goodwill with its\nholders of Preferred Stock, any failure to pay dividends timely could adversely effect the Company’s sales.\nAdditionally, as the Company focuses its issuance of Preferred Stock to wine enthusiasts likely to purchase the\nCompany’s wines, any failure by management to successfully target its stock sales could diminish the opportunity to\nmaximize earnings and offset the administrative, regulatory, and legal costs of this form of capital formation through\npreferred stockholder wine purchases.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our Preferred Stock or Common Stock in the future could adversely affect holders\nof Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be influenced by any preferred stock we may issue. Our board of directors\nis authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders.\nThis includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including\nvoting rights, dividend rights and preferences over Common Stock with respect to the liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of the business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our\nCommon Stock with respect to liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights\nthat dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of the Common Stock or the market price of\nthe Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nFailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively\nimpact our business.\nWe use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various\ntechnologies to process, store and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities,\npersonnel, customers, and suppliers as well as for administrative functions and many of such technology systems are\nindependent of one another for their functionality. We also use information technologies to process financial\ninformation and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax\nrequirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support. Our ability to\neffectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products is highly\ndependent on our technology systems. Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and\nthose of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions,\nincluding during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural\ndisasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access\nattempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any\nsuch interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could\nsubject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no\nassurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our\ncash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including\nhuman resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, as well as the information\ntechnology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in\nproprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and\npersonnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information\nrelated to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third\nparty were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in\nthe unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers’ or personnel’s data or\nconfidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods\ncould result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental\ninvestigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material liability.\nThe provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could delay or deter tender offers or\ntakeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could make it more difficult for a third\nparty to acquire control of us, even if that transaction could be beneficial to stockholders. These impediments include,\nbut are not limited to; the classification of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) into three classes serving staggered\n41\nthree-year terms, which makes it more difficult to quickly replace Board members; the ability of our Board, subject to\ncertain limitations under the NASDAQ rules, to issue shares of Preferred Stock with rights as it deems appropriate\nwithout stockholder approval; a provision that special meetings of our Board may be called only by our chief executive\nofficer or at the request of holders of not less than half of all outstanding shares of our common stock; a provision that\nany member of the Board, or the entire Board, may be removed from office only for cause; and a provision that our\nstockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings\nof our stockholders. The Board may implement other changes that further limit the potential for tender offers or\ntakeover attempts.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nCybersecurity\nThe Company has not adopted any formal cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing,\nidentifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. The full board of directors has oversight\nresponsibility for the Company’s overall risk management, including cybersecurity risk, and has not delegated\noversight authority for cybersecurity risks to any committee. In fiscal year 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity\nthreats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nProperties\nVineyards – The Company owns or leases 1,018 acres of land, of which 704 acres is owned and 314 acres leased. Of\nthe 1,018 acres of land owned or leased, 535 acres are productive vineyards, 266 acres are pre-productive vineyards\nor are suitable for future vineyard plantings, and 217 acres are not suitable for vineyard planting or are used or reserved\nfor winery or hospitality purposes. See Item 1 Business - Vineyards, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nlocations of each of the Company’s vineyards (both owned and leased) and other information pertaining to the\nproduction capacity, harvest totals and other important characteristics of each such vineyard.\nWine production facility – We believe the Company’s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently\nproducing up to 275,000 cases (654,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2023,\nthe Winery produced approximately 234,086 cases (556,551 gallons) of wine, mostly from its 2022 and 2021 harvest.\nThe Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging, and bottling wine, as\nwell as an underground wine cellar, meeting rooms, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside\nproduction area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes. The Company also has a 23,000 square foot\nstorage building to store its inventory of bottled product. The production area is equipped with a settling tank and\nsprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in compliance with environmental\nregulations. The Company’s main hospitality Center is located at the Company’s Estate Winery (the “Hospitality\nCenter”) and is a large 35,642 square foot tasting and hospitality facility. The Hospitality Center sits above the\nunderground barrel cellar and tunnel that connects with the Winery. The facility includes a basement cellar, tunnel,\nand barrel room of 11,090 square feet used to store up to 1,800 barrels of wine for aging in the proper environment.\nThe Company-owned Tualatin Estate Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately\n28,000 cases (66,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The production capacity at the Tualatin\nEstate Winery is not currently used, but is available to the Company to meet future production needs. The storage\ncapacity at the Tualatin Estate Winery is periodically used to store excess bulk wine. Additionally, the Company\noperates a small retail store and tasting room at the Tualatin Estate Winery.\nThe Company-owned sparkling winery, Domaine Willamette, is located adjacent to Highway 99 in Dundee, Oregon,\nat Bernau Estate. Bernau Estate also features a tasting room and restaurant, retail bottle shop and residence, in addition\nto the winery.\nThe Company carries Property and Liability insurance coverage in amounts deemed adequate by management.\nFor additional discussion of vineyard and wine production facilities, see Description of Business.\nLegal Proceedings\n42\nAlthough the Company from time to time may be involved with disputes, claims and litigation related to the conduct\nof its business, there are no material legal proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which any of its\nproperty is subject, and the Company’s management does not know of any such action being contemplated.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-5(e) under the Exchange Act) pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-5 under the Exchange\nAct. Based on that review, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective\nto ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act: (1)\nis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and\n(2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable\n(and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in\nachieving its stated goals.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and\nincludes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (b) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well designed,\nhave inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable\nassurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based\non this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial\nreporting was effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined\nin Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that our certifying\nofficers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting.\n43\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPAGE\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 45\nFinancial Statements\nBalance Sheets 46\nStatements of Operations 47\nStatements of Shareholders’ Equity 48\nStatements of Cash Flows 49\nNotes to Financial Statements 50-61\n44\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nWillamette Valley Vineyards, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years\nthen ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

(the “Company”) owns and operates vineyards,\nwineries and tasting rooms, and produces and distributes premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines,\nprimarily Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Riesling and Sparkling wine.\nThe Company has direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors. These sales channels offer comparable\nproducts to customers and utilize similar processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-\nto-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin than national sales to distributors due to differentiated pricing\nbetween these segments.\nBasis of presentation – The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFinancial instruments and concentrations of risk – The Company has the following financial instruments: cash and\ncash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, grapes payable, and short and long-term\ndebt.\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained at five financial institutions. Deposits held with these financial institutions\nmay exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon\ndemand and are maintained with a financial institution of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk.\nIn 2023, sales to one distributor represented approximately 14.5% of total Company revenue. In 2022, sales to one\ndistributor represented approximately 17.5% of total Company revenue.\nAt December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for approximately 27% of accounts receivable. At December 31,\n2022, two customers accounted for approximately 27% and 14% of accounts receivable.\nOther comprehensive income – The nature of the Company’s business and related transactions do not give rise to\nother comprehensive income.\nCash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds.\nAccounts receivable – The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require\ncollateral. A reserve is maintained for potential credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on an assessment\nof the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such\nas historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions\nthat may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company has credit risk associated with uncollateralized trade\naccounts receivable from all operations totaling $2,994,829 as of December 31, 2023, net of the allowance for credit\nlosses. The Company had credit risk associated with uncollateralized trade accounts receivable from all operations\ntotaling $4,226,948 and $3,163,375 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, net of the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 2.\nInventories – For Company produced wines, after a portion of the vineyard becomes commercially productive, the\nannual crop and production costs relating to such portion are recognized as work-in-process inventories. Such costs\nare accumulated with related direct and indirect harvest costs, wine processing and production costs, and are\ntransferred to finished goods inventories when the wine is produced, bottled, and ready for sale.\nThe cost of finished goods is recognized as cost of sales when the wine product is sold. Finished goods and work-in-\nprocess inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value by variety. Winemaking and\npackaging materials are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the value of\n50\nan asset that can be realized upon the sale of the asset, less a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with either\nthe eventual sale or the disposal of the asset in question.\nIn accordance with general practices in the wine industry, wine inventories are generally included in current assets in\nthe accompanying balance sheets, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for more than one year (Note\n3).\nVineyard development costs – Vineyard development costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and\nexpenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises. The costs are capitalized\nuntil the vineyard becomes commercially productive, at which time annual amortization is recognized using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years.\nAccumulated amortization of vineyard development costs aggregated $2,518,585 and $2,354,989 at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory\ncosts and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold. For the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022,\n$163,596 and $284,980, respectively, was capitalized into inventory costs.\nProperty and equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. Land improvements are depreciated over 15 to 30 years. Winery buildings are\ndepreciated over 30 years. Equipment is depreciated over 3 to 15 years, depending on the classification of the asset.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful life. Depreciation is\ndiscussed further in Note 4.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred. Expenditures for additions\nand betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated\ndepreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations.\nReview of long-lived assets for impairment – The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nLong-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, vineyard development costs, and operating lease right\nof use assets. Circumstances that might cause the Company to evaluate its long-lived assets for impairment could\ninclude a significant decline in the prices the Company or the industry can charge for its products, which could be\ncaused by general economic or other factors, changes in laws or regulations that make it difficult or more costly for\nthe Company to distribute its products to its markets at prices which generate adequate returns, natural disasters,\nsignificant decrease in demand for the Company’s products or significant increase in the costs to manufacture the\nCompany’s products.\nRecoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the\nimpairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair\nvalue of the assets. The Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for\nwhich identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).\nThis would typically be at the winery level. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with\nlong-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIncome taxes – Income taxes are recognized using enacted tax rates and are composed of taxes on financial accounting\nincome that is adjusted for requirements of current tax law, and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are estimated using the\nasset and liability approach, whereby, deferred income taxes are calculated for the expected future tax consequences\nof temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities.\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. The Company recognizes interest\nassessed by taxing authorities as a component of tax expense. The Company recognizes any penalties assessed by\ntaxing authorities as a component of tax expense. Interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 were not material.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The Company evaluates the potential realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation\nallowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of\nrealization included the Company’s forecast of future taxable income or loss and available tax planning strategies that\n51\ncould be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Certain intangible assets and liabilities will be deductible\nfor tax purposes and may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities as the benefits are recognized in the Company’s\ntax returns.\nThe Company files U.S. federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as well as income tax\nreturns in Oregon and California. The Company may be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2020 through\n2023. Additionally, the Company may be subject to examinations by state taxing jurisdictions for tax years 2019\nthrough 2023. The Company is not aware of any current examinations by the IRS or the state taxing authorities.\nRevenue recognition – The Company recognizes revenue once its performance obligation to the customer is\ncompleted, and control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. Revenue reflects the total amount the\nCompany receives, or expects to receive, from the customer and includes shipping costs that are billed and included\nin the consideration. Excise taxes that are accrued and paid, as a result of a transaction, are accounted for as an offset\nto sales in the net sales calculation. The Company’s contractual obligations to customers generally have a single point\nof obligation and are short term in nature.\nThe cost of price promotions and rebates are treated as reductions of revenue. Credit sales are recorded as trade\naccounts receivable, and no collateral is required. Revenue from items sold through the Company’s retail locations is\nrecognized at the time of sale. Net revenue reported herein is shown net of sales allowances and excise taxes. If the\nconditions for revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers the revenue until all conditions are met. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company has recorded deferred revenue in the amount of $490,523, which is included in\nunearned revenue on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded\ndeferred revenue in the amount of $335,431 and $255,376, respectively, which is included in unearned revenue on the\nbalance sheet. Gift cards that have been issued but not used are also treated as unearned revenue and were $1,480,138\nas of December 31, 2023. Gift cards that have been issued but not used are also treated as unearned revenue and were\n$1,106,970 and $682,881 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDistributor Sales Segment – Wholesale wine sales are through distributors and the Company recognizes revenue when\nthe product is shipped, and title passes to the distributor. The Company’s standard terms are ‘FOB’ shipping point,\nwith no customer acceptance provisions. The cost of price promotions and rebates are treated as reductions of revenue.\nCredit sales are recorded as trade accounts receivable, and no collateral is required.\nThe Company has price incentive programs with its distributors to encourage product placement and depletions. Sales\nare reported net of incentive program expenses. Incentive program payments are made when completed incentive\nprogram payment requests are received from the customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany recorded incentive program expenses of $1,057,198 and $1,333,396, respectively, as a reduction in sales on\nthe Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company has recorded an incentive program\nliability in the amount of $54,003 and $111,398, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance\nsheets. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer and have\nhistorically been in line with actual costs incurred.\nDirect Sales Segment – The Company sells wine directly to customers through its tasting rooms, web site and wine\nclub. Additionally, the Company sells merchandise, food, and hospitality related services through its tasting rooms.\nTasting room sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale and internet sales are recognized at time of shipment.\nHospitality sales, that are paid in advance of the event, are accrued as unearned revenue, and are subsequently\nrecognized as revenue in the period of the event. Wine club sales are made under an agreement with the customer,\nwhich specifies the quantity and timing of the wine club shipment. Wine club charges are billed to the customer’s\ncredit card, at the time of shipment, and revenue is then recognized.\nThe Company periodically sells bulk wine or grapes that either do not meet the Company’s quality standards or are in\nexcess of production requirements. These sales are recognized when ownership transfers to the buyer which occurs at\nthe point of shipment.\nCost of goods sold – Costs of goods sold include costs associated with grape growing, external grape costs, packaging\nmaterials, winemaking and production costs, vineyard and production administrative support and overhead costs,\npurchasing and receiving costs and warehousing costs.\nAdministrative support, purchasing, receiving and most other fixed overhead costs are expensed as selling, general\nand administrative expenses without regard to inventory units. Warehouse and winery production and facilities costs\n52\nare allocated to inventory units on a per gallon basis during the production of wine, prior to bottling the final product.\nNo further costs are allocated to inventory units after bottling.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses – Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of\nnon-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs, advertising, and other marketing promotions. Advertising costs\nare expensed as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, advertising costs incurred were $393,859 and $340,427 respectively.\nThe Company provides an allowance to distributors for providing sample of products to potential customers. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, these costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses were, $93,272 and $87,996, respectively.\nShipping and handling costs – Amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling costs are\nincluded in net sales. Costs incurred for shipping and handling charges are included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, shipping and handling costs incurred were\n$723,787 and $681,975 respectively.\nExcise taxes – The Company pays alcohol excise taxes based on product sales to both the Oregon Liquor Control\nCommission and to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Company\nis liable for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The federal\ntax rate is affected by a small winery tax credit provision, which declines based upon the number of gallons of wine\nproduction in a year rather than the quantity sold. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton basis\nto the Oregon Liquor Control Commission for the Oregon Wine Advisory. For the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, excise taxes incurred were $431,714 and $312,103 respectively.\nLoss per common share after preferred dividends – loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding each year.\nLeases – We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. On our balance sheets, our operating leases are\nincluded in Operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets, Current portion of lease liabilities and Lease liabilities, net\nof current portion. The Company does not currently have any finance leases. Leases that have a term of twelve months\nor less upon commencement date are considered short-term in nature. Accordingly, short-term leases are not included\non the balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date we\nhave the right to control the property.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation\nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For leases that do not provide\nan implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease expense\nfor lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSignificant judgment may be required when determining whether a contract contains a lease, the length of the lease\nterm, the allocation of the consideration in a contract between lease and non-lease components, and the determination\nof the discount rate included in our leases. We review the underlying objective of each contract, the terms of the\ncontract, and consider our current and future business conditions when making these judgments.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments, and in May 2019 issued ASU 2019-05, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted\nTransition Relief (collectively referred to as “Topic 326”). Topic 326 requires the measurement of all expected credit\nlosses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on all relevant information, such as historical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that could impact the collectability of the amounts.\nThe Company adopted Topic 326 effective January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective approach. No cumulative\neffect adjustment was required to opening retained earnings. The Company measures expected credit losses of\nfinancial assets based on historical loss and other information available to management. These expected credit losses\nare recorded to an allowance for credit losses valuation account that is deducted from accounts receivable to present\n53\nthe net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, no\nchange to allowance for credit losses was deemed necessary.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure\nrequirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.\nThe expanded annual disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2024, and the expanded interim\ndisclosures are effective in 2025 and will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented.

          "content": "WILLAMETTE VALLEY VINEYARDS, INC.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) is to oversee the\naccounting and financial reporting processes of Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. and its\naffiliated and subsidiary companies, if any (the “Company”) and the internal and external audit\nprocesses. The Committee also assists the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company in\nfulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information which will be\nprovided to shareholders and others, and the systems of internal control regarding finance,\naccounting, legal compliance and ethics, which management and the Board have established.\nIn fulfilling its purpose, it is the responsibility of the Committee to provide an open\navenue of communication between the Board, management, the internal audit department and the\nindependent auditors. The Committee is the Board’s principal agent in ensuring the integrity of\nmanagement and the adequacy of disclosure to shareholders. The opportunity for the\nindependent auditors to meet with the entire Board as needed is not to be restricted, however.\nThe independent auditors are ultimately accountable to the Committee, as representatives of the\nCompany’s shareholders; the Committee has the sole authority to determine funding for, select,\nevaluate, and, where appropriate, replace the independent auditors. The Committee oversees the\nindependent auditors, including their independence and objectivity.\nThe Committee members are not acting as professional accountants or auditors, and their\nfunctions are not intended to duplicate or substitute for the activities of management and the\nindependent auditors. The Committee serves a Board-level oversight role in which it provides\nadvice, counsel and direction to management and the Board, independent auditors on the basis of\ninformation it receives, discussions with the independent auditors, and the experience of the\nCommittee’s members in business, financial and accounting matters.\nComposition\nThe Committee shall be comprised of at least three (3) members, each of whom shall be a\nmember of the Company’s Board of Directors. Each member shall meet the independence\nrequirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., applicable laws, and rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. The members of the Committee shall also meet all\nfinancial knowledge and experience qualifications required under rules promulgated by The\nNasdaq Stock Market, Inc., the Securities and Exchange Commission or other governing body,\nas may be in effect from time to time. In addition, at least one member of the Committee shall\nbe an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined in applicable rules. Members\nand a Chair of the Committee shall be appointed by the full Board.\nAuthority\nThe Committee has the authority to investigate any activity of the Company within its\nscope of responsibilities and shall have unrestricted access to members of management and all\ninformation relevant to its responsibilities. All employees are directed to cooperate as requested\nDWT 11800871v1 0044487-000017\nby members of the Committee. The Committee is empowered to retain independent legal\ncounsel and other advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to assist the Committee in\nfulfilling its responsibilities, and to approve the fees and other retention terms of such advisors.\nMeetings\nThe Committee shall hold meetings as often as may be necessary or appropriate and will\nannually hold at least the minimum amount of meetings required by the Nasdaq Stock Market,\nInc., and/or applicable laws and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMeetings may be held telephonically. In lieu of a meeting, the Committee may also act by\nunanimous written consent. Prior to each meeting, the Chair of the Committee may\ncommunicate with the independent auditors to review the agenda and solicit input on any\nadditional topics that should be covered.\nAttendance\nMembers of the Committee are expected to use all reasonable efforts to attend each\nmeeting. As necessary or desirable, the Chair may request that members of management, the\ninternal audit director, and representatives of the independent auditors be present at meetings of\nthe Committee.\nMinutes\nMinutes of each meeting shall be prepared under the direction of the Chair of the\nCommittee and circulated to Committee members for review and approval and then circulated to\nthe directors who are not members of the Committee. Copies are to be made available to the\nindependent auditors.\nSpecific Duties\nThe Committee shall:\n1. Enable direct communication between the independent auditors and the Committee at any\ntime. Instruct the independent auditors to report directly to the Committee any serious\ndifficulties or disputes with management, and ensure they are appropriately resolved.\n2. Appoint, determine funding and other retention terms for, oversee and, if the Committee\ndetermines necessary or appropriate, replace the independent auditors. Take, or\nrecommend that the full Board take, appropriate action to oversee the independence of\nthe independent auditors.\n3. Ensure the receipt from the independent auditors of a formal written statement\ndelineating all relationships between the auditor and the Company, consistent with\nIndependence Standards Board Standard 1, and actively engage in a dialogue with the\nauditor with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the\nobjectivity and independence of the auditor.\n2\nDWT 11800871v1 0044487-000017\n4. Review the scope of the independent auditor’s audit examination, including their\nengagement letter, prior to the annual audit of the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements. Approve in advance the engagement of the independent auditors.\nPeriodically review the independent auditors’ fees for all audit and non-audit services.\nAdopt specific policies and procedures for approval of the auditor’s fees, ensuring that\nsuch policies and procedures provide sufficient detail so that the Committee’s\nresponsibilities are not delegated to management. These policies and procedures may\ndelegate authority to one or more members of the Committee to grant approval, provided\nthat the decision is presented to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Review all\nengagements of the independent auditors at the next scheduled meeting.\n5. Review the Company’s periodic financial results with management and the independent\nauditors. Such review should occur at least annually. This review includes:\n• The financial statements and disclosures to be included in the Company’s annual\nfinancial statements.\n• Significant transactions not a normal part of the Company’s operations.\n• Any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n• The Company’s critical accounting policies and the disclosure of them as appropriate or\notherwise required by applicable law, rules or regulations.\n• Significant management judgments and accounting estimates.\n• Significant changes in the Company’s accounting policies or their application, or\nalternative GAAP treatments discussed with the independent auditor.\n• Adjustments proposed by the independent auditors.\n• The independent auditors’ audit opinion and their judgment on the quality of the\nCompany’s accounting policies and financial reporting.\n6. Review the audit process with management and the independent auditors, upon\ncompletion of their annual audit, to evaluate:\n• The cooperation received by the independent auditors, including access to all requested\ninformation.\n• Any instances where management has obtained “second opinions” from other external\nauditors.\n• Any disagreements with management that, if not satisfactorily resolved, would have\ncaused them to modify their report on the financial statements.\n• Management’s comments regarding the audit.\n3\nDWT 11800871v1 0044487-000017\n7. Review periodically with management and the independent auditors the adequacy of the\nCompany’s accounting and financial personnel and any relevant recommendations\nconcerning internal controls, accounting principles and accounting/reporting systems.\n8. Review the effect of any important new pronouncements of the accounting profession\nand other regulatory bodies on the Company’s accounting and reporting policies.\n9. Review any inquiries related to accounting or financial reporting matters received from\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, and management’s response\nthereto. Ensure that any complaints received by the Company regarding its accounting,\ninternal control or auditing matters are addressed.\n10. Review and approve or ratify or refer to a special committee appointed by the Board all\nsignificant related party transactions and potential conflict of interest situations.\n11. Review with management the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics to assure that it is\nkept updated and is appropriate for the Company’s business activities; that it applies to all\nCompany directors, officers and employees; and that it provides for an enforcement\nmechanism. Any amendments or waivers of the Code of Conduct and Ethics must be\napproved by the Board of Directors, or by the Committee acting on behalf of the Board,\nand shall be promptly reported publicly in accordance with applicable Securities and\nExchange Commission regulations. Review with management the Company’s systems to\nmonitor compliance with any of the Company’s business or ethics standards, including\nthe Code of Conduct and Ethics, and applicable legal requirements. Establish procedures\nfor the confidential, anonymous submission of complaints and concerns regarding\nquestionable accounting, auditing, internal control, legal or ethical matters, and\nprocedures for their receipt, retention and treatment.\n12.

Establish a system for reporting of complaints relating to accounting, internal controls,\nand auditing matters that permits direct, confidential communications between\nwhistleblowers and the Committee.\n15.

Do not use confidential\ninformation acquired in the course of one’s work for personal advantage.\nOfficers, managers and other supervisors are expected to develop in employees a sense of\ncommitment to the spirit, as well as the letter, of the Code. Supervisors are also expected to\nensure that all agents and contractors conform to Code standards when working for or on behalf\nof the Company. Nothing in the Code alters the employment at-will policy of employees of the\nCompany.\nThis Code cannot possibly describe every practice or principle related to honest and\nethical conduct. The Code addresses conduct that is particularly important to proper dealings\nwith the people and entities with whom we interact, but reflects only a part of our commitment.\nThe Code should be read in conjunction with other policies the Company has which address\nconduct of employees. Actions by members of your immediate family or other persons who live\nin your household also may potentially result in ethical issues to the extent that they involve the\nCompany’s business. For example, acceptance of inappropriate gifts by a family member from\n1\nDWT 11800920v1 0044487-000020\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020\none of the Company’s suppliers could create a conflict of interest and result in a Code violation\nattributable to you. Consequently, in complying with the Code, you should consider not only\nyour own conduct, but also that of your immediate family members, and other persons who live\nin your household.\nThe integrity and reputation of the Company depends on the honesty, fairness and\nintegrity brought to the job by each person associated with us. It is the responsibility of each\nemployee to apply common sense, together with the highest personal ethical standards, in\nmaking business decisions where there is no stated guideline in the Code. Unyielding personal\nintegrity is the foundation of corporate integrity.\nYOU SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ANY\nCONDUCT MAY VIOLATE THE CODE, VOICE CONCERNS OR CLARIFY GRAY AREAS.\nSECTION 12 BELOW DETAILS THE COMPLIANCE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU.\nIN ADDITION, YOU SHOULD BE ALERT TO POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE BY\nOTHERS AND REPORT SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS, WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY FORM OF\nRETALIATION.\nAS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SECTION 12, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED\nPROCEDURES TO REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE. Violations of the Code will not\nbe tolerated. Any employee who violates the standards in the Code may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and, in appropriate cases,\ncivil legal action or referral for criminal prosecution.\n1. Legal Compliance\nObeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation of this Code. Our success\ndepends upon each of our officers, directors and employees operating within legal guidelines and\ncooperating with local, national and international authorities. It is therefore essential that you\nunderstand the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to your business unit and area of\nresponsibility. While we do not expect you to memorize every detail of these laws, rules and\nregulations, we want you to be able to determine when to seek advice from your supervisor.\nDisregard of the law will not be tolerated. Violation of domestic or foreign laws, rules\nand regulations may subject you, as well as the Company, to civil and/or criminal penalties. You\nshould be aware that conduct and records, including emails, are subject to internal and external\naudits, and to discovery by third parties in the event of a government investigation or civil\nlitigation. It is in everyone’s best interests to know and comply with our legal and ethical\nobligations.\n2. Confidential Information\nEmployees who have access to confidential (or “inside”) information are not permitted to\nuse or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose except to\nconduct our business. All non-public information about the Company or about companies with\nwhich we do business is considered confidential information. To use material non-public\ninformation in connection with buying or selling securities, including “tipping” others who might\nmake an investment decision on the basis of this information, is not only unethical, it is illegal.\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 2\nEmployees must exercise the utmost care when handling material inside information.\n3. Conflicts of Interest\nA “conflict of interest” occurs when an individual’s personal interest may interfere in any\nway with the performance of his or her duties or the best interests of the Company. A conflicting\npersonal interest could result from an expectation of personal gain now or in the future or from a\nneed to satisfy a prior or concurrent personal obligation. We expect our employees, officers and\ndirectors to be free from influences that conflict with the best interests of the Company. Even\nthe appearance of a conflict of interest where none actually exists can be damaging and should be\navoided. Whether or not a conflict of interest exists or will exist can be unclear. Conflicts of\ninterest are prohibited unless specifically authorized as described below.\nIf you have any questions about a potential conflict or if you become aware of an actual\nor potential conflict, and you are not an officer or director of the Company, you should discuss\nthe matter with your supervisor (as further described in Section 12). Supervisors may not\nauthorize conflict of interest matters without first seeking the approval of the Ethics Compliance\nOfficer. If the Ethics Compliance Officer is involved in the potential or actual conflict, the\nsupervisor should seek authorization from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFactors that may be considered in evaluating a potential conflict of interest are, among others:\n• whether it may interfere with the employee’s job performance, responsibilities or\nmorale;\n• whether the employee has access to confidential information;\n• whether it may interfere with the job performance, responsibilities or morale of others\nwithin the organization;\n• any potential adverse or beneficial impact on our business;\n• any potential adverse or beneficial impact on our relationships with our customers or\nsuppliers or other service providers;\n• whether it would enhance or support a competitor’s position;\n• the extent to which it would result in financial or other benefit (direct or indirect) to\nthe employee;\n• the extent to which it would result in financial or other benefit (direct or indirect) to\none of our customers, suppliers or other service providers; and\n• the extent to which it would appear improper to an outside observer.\n4. Corporate Opportunities\nYou may not take personal advantage of opportunities that are presented to you or\ndiscovered by you as a result of your position with us or through your use of the Company’s\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 3\nproperty or information, unless authorized by your supervisor or, with respect to issues raised by\nexecutive officers or directors, the Audit Committee. Even opportunities that are acquired\nprivately by you may be questionable if they are related to our existing or proposed lines of\nbusiness. Participation in an investment or outside business opportunity that is related to our\nexisting or proposed lines of business must be pre-approved. You cannot use your position with\nus or our property or information for improper personal gain, nor can you compete with us in any\nway.\n5. Maintenance of Corporate Books, Records, Documents and Accounts; Financial\nIntegrity\nThe integrity of our records and public disclosure depends on the validity, accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information supporting the entries to our books of account. Therefore, our\ncorporate and business records should be completed accurately and honestly. The making of\nfalse or misleading entries, whether they relate to financial results or test results, is strictly\nprohibited. Our records serve as a basis for managing our business and are important in meeting\nour obligations to customers, suppliers, creditors, employees and others with whom we do\nbusiness. As a result, it is important that our books, records and accounts accurately and fairly\nreflect, in reasonable detail, our assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, as well as all\ntransactions and changes in assets and liabilities. We require that:\n• no entry be made in our books and records that intentionally hides or disguises the\nnature of any transaction or of any of our liabilities, or misclassifies any transactions\nas to accounts or accounting periods;\n• transactions be supported by appropriate documentation;\n• the terms of sales and other commercial transactions be reflected accurately in the\ndocumentation for those transactions and all such documentation be reflected\naccurately in our books and records;\n• employees comply with our system of internal controls; and\n• no cash or other assets be maintained for any purpose in any unrecorded or “off-the-\nbooks” fund.\nOur accounting records are also relied upon to produce reports for our management,\nshareholders and creditors, as well as for governmental agencies. These reports must provide\nfull, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure and fairly present our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Employees who collect, provide or analyze information for\nor otherwise contribute in any way in preparing or verifying these reports should strive to ensure\nthat our financial disclosure is accurate and transparent and that our reports contain all of the\ninformation about the Company that would be important to enable shareholders and potential\ninvestors to assess the soundness and risks of our business and finances and the quality and\nintegrity of our accounting and disclosures. In addition:\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 4\n• no employee may take or authorize any action that would cause our financial records\nor financial disclosure to fail to comply with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, or other applicable laws, rules and regulations; and\n• all employees must cooperate fully with our accounting department and internal\nauditors, as well as our independent public accountants and legal counsel, respond to\ntheir questions with candor and provide them with complete and accurate information\nto help ensure that our books and records, are accurate and complete.\nAny employee who becomes aware of any departure from these standards has a\nresponsibility to report his or her knowledge promptly to a supervisor, the Ethics Compliance\nOfficer or one of the other compliance resources described in Section 12.\n6. Fair Dealing\nWe strive to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. Advantages over our\ncompetitors are to be obtained through superior performance of our products, not through\nunethical or illegal business practices. Acquiring proprietary information from others through\nimproper means, possessing trade secret information that was improperly obtained, or inducing\nimproper disclosure of confidential information from past or present employees of other\ncompanies is prohibited, even if motivated by an intention to advance our interests. If\ninformation is obtained by mistake that may constitute a trade secret or other confidential\ninformation of another business, or if you have any questions about the legality of proposed\ninformation gathering, you must consult your supervisor or the Ethics Compliance Officer, as\nfurther described in Section 12.\nYou are expected to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, employees and anyone else\nwith whom you have contact in the course of performing your job. No employee may take unfair\nadvantage of anyone through misuse of confidential information, misrepresentation of material\nfacts or any other unfair dealing practices.\nEmployees involved in procurement have a special responsibility to adhere to principles\nof fair competition in the purchase of products and services by selecting suppliers based\nexclusively on normal commercial considerations, such as quality, cost, availability, service and\nreputation, and not on the receipt of special favors.\n7. Gifts and Entertainment\nBusiness entertainment and gifts are meant to create goodwill and sound working\nrelationships and not to gain improper advantage with customers, vendors or suppliers or\nfacilitate approvals from government officials. Unless express permission is received from a\nsupervisor, entertainment (other than of a normal social nature) and gifts cannot be offered,\nprovided or accepted by any employee unless consistent with customary business practices and\nnot (a) excessive in value, which would be any one item valued over $100.00 or multiple items\nin any one year valued in the aggregate over $500.00 unless the customers, suppliers or vendors\nare present at such entertainment event, (b) in cash, (c) susceptible of being construed as a bribe\nor kickback or (d) in violation of any laws. This principle applies to our transactions everywhere\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 5\nin the world, even where the practice is widely considered “a way of doing business.” Under\nsome statutes, giving anything of value to a government official to obtain or retain business or\nfavorable treatment is a criminal act subject to prosecution and conviction. Discuss with your\nsupervisor any proposed entertainment or gifts if you are uncertain about their appropriateness.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Code, the Company may make\nreasonable and customary gifts to distributors.\n8. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees are expected to protect our assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft,\ncarelessness and waste have a direct impact on our profitability. Our property, such as office\nsupplies, automobiles, computer equipment, phones and offices, are expected to be used only for\nlegitimate business purposes, although incidental personal use may be permitted. Employees\nshould be mindful of the fact that we retain the right to access, review, monitor and disclose any\ninformation transmitted, received or stored using our electronic equipment, with or without an\nemployee’s or third party’s knowledge, consent or approval. Any misuse or suspected misuse of\nour assets must be immediately reported to your supervisor.\n9. Confidentiality\nOne of our most important assets is our confidential information. Employees, officers\nand directors who have received or have access to confidential information should take care to\nkeep this information confidential. Confidential information may include but is not limited to\nbusiness, marketing and service plans, financial information, databases, customer data\n(including, for example, customer financial information), pricing strategies, personnel data,\npersonally identifiable information pertaining to our employees, customers or other individuals\n(including, for example, names, addresses, telephone numbers and social security numbers), and\nsimilar types of information provided to us by our customers.\nExcept when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated, you must not share our or our\ncustomers’ confidential information with third parties or others within the Company who have\nno legitimate business purpose for receiving that information. Unauthorized use or distribution\nof this information could also be illegal and result in civil liability and/or criminal penalties. In\ndetermining whether a matter is authorized or legally required to be disclosed, you must first\ncoordinate with your supervisor.\nYou should also take care not to inadvertently disclose confidential information.\nMaterials that contain confidential information, such as memos, notebooks, computer disks and\nlaptop computers should be stored securely. Unauthorized posting or discussion of any\ninformation concerning our business, information or prospects on the Internet is prohibited. You\nmay not discuss our business, information or prospects in any “chat room,” regardless of whether\nyou use your own name or a pseudonym. Be cautious when discussing sensitive information in\npublic places like elevators, airports, restaurants and “quasi-public” areas within the Company,\nsuch as lobbies, retail areas, cafeterias or lunch rooms. All Company emails, voicemails and\nother communications are presumed confidential and should not be forwarded or otherwise\ndisseminated outside of the Company, except where required for legitimate business purposes.\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 6\nIn addition to the above responsibilities, if you are handling information protected by any\nprivacy policy published by us, such as confidential customer information, then you must handle\nthat information solely in accordance with the applicable policy.\n10. Special Provisions Applicable to Senior Financial Officers\nThe Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer\n(CFO), and other senior finance and accounting officers (collectively, the “Senior Financial\nOfficers”), hold an important and elevated role in corporate governance in that they are uniquely\ncapable and empowered to ensure that all stakeholders’ interests are appropriately balanced,\nprotected, and preserved. Because of this special role, the Senior Financial Officers are bound\nby the following principles and responsibilities, and by accepting the Code, each agrees that he\nor she will, in his or her capacity as an employee of the Company:\n• Act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest in\npersonal and professional relationships.\n• Provide information that is accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely, and\nunderstandable to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure\nreports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, government\nagencies and in other public communications.\n• Comply with rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and local governments,\nand other appropriate private and public regulatory agencies.\n• Act in good faith, responsibly, with due care, competence and diligence, without\nmisrepresenting material facts or allowing his or her independent judgment to be\nsubordinated.\n• Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of his or her work\nexcept when authorized or otherwise legally obligated to disclose. Confidential\ninformation acquired in the course of his or her work will not be used for personal\nadvantage.\n• Share knowledge and maintain skills important and relevant to stakeholders’ needs.\n• Proactively promote and be an example of ethical behavior as a responsible partner\namong peers, in the work environment and the community.\n• Achieve responsible use of and control over all assets and resources employed or\nentrusted.\n• Be responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate internal control structure\nand procedures for financial reporting, including disclosure controls.\n• Promptly report Code violations to the Audit Committee.\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 7\n11. Waivers\nAny waiver of this Code for executive officers (including, where required by applicable\nlaws, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or\ncontroller (or persons performing similar functions)) or directors may be authorized only by our\nBoard of Directors or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and may be disclosed to\nshareholders or in public filings as required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n12. Compliance Standards and Procedures\nCompliance Resources\nWe have established the position of Ethics Compliance Officer to oversee this program.\nThe Ethics Compliance Officer is a person to whom you can address any questions or concerns.\nIn addition to fielding questions or concerns with respect to potential violations of this Code, the\nEthics Compliance Officer is responsible for:\n• investigating possible violations of the Code;\n• monitoring compliance with the Code on both an informal and a formal basis,\nplacing particular emphasis on the relationships between employees and third\nparties;\n• distributing copies of the Code periodically to each employee with a reminder that\neach employee is responsible for reading, understanding and complying with the\nCode;\n• updating the Code as needed and alerting employees to any updates, with\nappropriate approval of the Board of Directors, to reflect changes in the law, the\nCompany operations and in recognized best practices, and to reflect the Company\nexperience; and\n• otherwise promoting an atmosphere of responsible and ethical conduct.\nYour most immediate resource for any matter related to the Code is your supervisor. He\nor she may have the information you need, or may be able to refer the question to another\nappropriate source. There may, however, be times when you prefer not to go to your supervisor.\nIn these instances, you should feel free to discuss your concern with the Ethics Compliance\nOfficer. If you are uncomfortable speaking with the Ethics Compliance Officer because he or\nshe works in your department or is one of your supervisors, please contact the Chief Executive\nOfficer or Chief Financial Officer.\nFor those who wish to ask questions about Company policy, seek guidance on specific\nsituations, or report violations of the Code, you may contact the Ethics Compliance Officer.\nThere is no need to identify yourself, if you prefer not to. If you desire that your identity be\nconfidential, please advise the Ethics Compliance Officer. Whether you identify yourself or\nremain anonymous, your telephonic or email contact will be kept strictly confidential to the\nextent reasonably possible within the objectives of the Code.\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 8\nClarifying Questions and Concerns; Reporting Possible Violations\nIt is the Company’s policy that employees, officers and directors of the Company have\nopen opportunities to bring to the attention of any supervisor or the Ethics Compliance Officer,\nallegations of wrongdoing of any officer, director or employee, including but not limited to\nviolations of this Code, laws or regulations, any actions considered unsafe or any unsound\nbusiness practices that jeopardize the welfare and safety of employees or customers. Other\nallegations may include but are not limited to corruption, violations of this Code, bribery,\nacceptance of gifts beyond established limits, theft of Company property, misuse of Company\nproperty and facilities or any activities that involves fraud or misconduct. If you encounter a\nsituation or are considering a course of action and its appropriateness is unclear, discuss the\nmatter promptly with your supervisor or the Ethics Compliance Officer; even the appearance of\nimpropriety can be very damaging and should be avoided.\nIf you are aware of a suspected or actual violation of Code standards by others, you have\na responsibility to report it. You are expected to promptly provide a compliance resource with a\nspecific description of the violation that you believe has occurred, including any information you\nhave about the persons involved and the time of the violation. Whether you choose to speak with\nyour supervisor or the Ethics Compliance Officer, you should do so without fear of any form of\nretaliation. We will take prompt disciplinary action against any employee who retaliates against\nyou, up to and including termination of employment.\nSupervisors must promptly report any complaints or observations of Code violations to\nthe Ethics Compliance Officer. The Ethics Compliance Officer will investigate all reported\npossible Code violations promptly and with the highest degree of confidentiality that is possible\nunder the specific circumstances. Your cooperation in the investigation will be expected. As\nneeded, the Ethics Compliance Officer will consult with the Human Resources department\nand/or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nIf the investigation indicates that a violation of the Code has probably occurred, we will\ntake such action as we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. If we determine that an\nemployee is responsible for a Code violation, he or she will be subject to disciplinary action up\nto, and including, termination of employment and, in appropriate cases, civil action or referral for\ncriminal prosecution. Appropriate action may also be taken to deter any future Code violations.\nDWT 11800920v2 0044487-000020 9"

BUSINESS\nBusiness\nIntroduction – The Company was incorporated in May 1988 to produce and sell premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietals. The Company was\noriginally established as a sole proprietorship by Oregon winegrower Jim Bernau in 1983. The Company is headquartered in Turner, Oregon, which is just\nsouth of the state capitol of Salem, Oregon. The Company’s wines are made from grapes grown in vineyards owned, leased or contracted by the Company,\nand from grapes purchased from other vineyards. The grapes are harvested, fermented and made into wine primarily at the Company’s winery in Turner,\nOregon (the “Estate Winery” or “Winery”) and the wines are sold principally under the Company’s Willamette Valley Vineyards label, but also under the\nDomaine Willamette, Griffin Creek, Tualatin Estate, Pambrun, Maison Bleue, Natoma, Metis, Pere Ami and Elton labels. The Company also owns the\nTualatin Estate Vineyards and Winery, located near Forest Grove, Oregon (the “Tualatin Winery”).\nSegments – The Company has identified two operating segments: direct sales and distributor sales, based upon their different distribution channels,\nmargins and selling strategies. Direct sales include retail sales in the tasting rooms, wine club sales, online sales, on-site events, kitchen and catering sales\nand other sales made directly to the consumer without the use of an intermediary.

The United States wine industry added\n400 new wineries in 2022, a 3% increase from 2021, according to Wine Analytics Report. From 2009 to 2021, the number of U.S. wineries grew from\n6,357 to 11,053, according to Statista, and consequently the wine industry can be considered one of the fastest-growing segments in agriculture. According\nto Wine Business Monthly’s February 2024 report, the number of US active wineries in 2023 stood at 11,620, showing a 1% decrease compared to the peak\nin 2022. The total retail value of wine sales has increased from $26.3 billion in 2000 to $78.4 billion in 2021, according to Statista. Additionally, 1.1 billion\ngallons of wine were consumed in 2021, an increase of 413 million from 2005 (Statista).\nThis growth rate has recently slowed and according to Silicon Valley Bank’s 2024 annual report premium wineries faced a challenging landscape in 2023.\nAccording to this report, while the value of premium wine continued to grow, volume sales were anticipated to finish lower for the year. Additionally,\ndirect-to-consumer volume and value sales declined and tasting room visitation dropped for the second consecutive year and consumer demand for the\noverall wine category continued its decline, with fewer U.S. consumers opting for wine and choosing alternatives such as ready-to-drink beverages, spirits,\ncannabis, or abstaining altogether.\nA 2023 study conducted by the Wine Market Council of 1,500 U.S. consumers identified a significant downward trend in wine consumption attributed to a\ngeneral reduction in alcohol consumption, primarily for health reasons. Previously considered a “healthy” option on the Healthy Eating Pyramid, alcohol\nconsumption is now cautioned against by organizations like the World Health Organization.\n5\nOverall, we believe the industry is expected to stabilize in 2024 around the current levels. However, of concern, consumption growth is mainly amongst\nthose over 60 years old, with the most significant growth area among 70-80-year-olds. Consequently, we believe future positive sales and growth will\ndepend on the industry targeting younger consumers. According to the State of the Wine Industry 2023 by Rob McMillan, younger wine consumers are not\nlimited by cost; instead, they seek something enticing to draw them in to learn more about wine, including but not limited to health, sustainability, social\nvalues, and transparent labeling,\nThe Company’s Board of Directors and management believe the winery’s focus on integrity in winemaking, small scale, storied estate vineyards,\nenvironmental stewardship, support for community needs and participatory wine experiences are reflective of the values of a number of prospective,\ndeveloping wine enthusiasts.\nThe Oregon wine industry – Oregon is a relatively new wine-producing region in comparison to California and France. In 1966, there were only two\ncommercial wineries licensed in Oregon. According to the Oregon Vineyard and Winery Report produced by University of Oregon’s Institute for Policy\nResearch and Engagement (“UOIPRE”) in 2022, the most recent year such data is available, the overall number of wineries increased from 1,058 to 1,116\nwith the biggest increases coming from the Willamette Valley, which added 38. Planted acres of wine grape vineyards increased by 2,588 acres from 41,899\nto 44,487, an increase of 6%, 40,774 acres of which were harvested. Oregon wine grapes produced a 2022 crop with a total value of $330 million, an\nincrease of 22% from 2021. Pinot Noir leads all varieties accounting for 71% of planted acreage and 67% of production. According to UOIPRE, Oregon\ncase sales in 2022 were 5.7 million, an 8% increase from 2021.\nBecause of climate, soil and other growing conditions, we believe the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally suited to growing superior quality\nPinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregon’s Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines have developed outstanding\nreputations, winning numerous national and international awards.\nHowever, Oregon has certain disadvantages as a wine-producing region. Oregon’s wines are lesser known to consumers worldwide, and the total wine\nproduction of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French competitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give\nOregon’s competitors certain financial, marketing, distribution, and unit cost advantages.\nFurthermore, Oregon’s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the\nautumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that year’s wine quality.\nFinally, phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that feeds on the roots of grapevines, has been found in several commercial vineyards in Oregon. Contrary to the\nCalifornia experience, most Oregon phylloxera infestations have expanded very slowly and have done only minimal damage. Nevertheless, phylloxera does\nconstitute a significant risk to Oregon vineyards. Prior to the discovery of phylloxera in Oregon, all vine plantings in the Company’s Estate Vineyard, in\nTurner, Oregon, were with non-resistant rootstock. In 1997, the Company purchased Tualatin Vineyards at the Tualatin Winery, which has phylloxera at its\nsite. All current plantings are with, and all future planting will be with, phylloxera-resistant rootstock at that location. The Company takes commercially\nreasonable precautions in an effort to prevent the spread of phylloxera to other vineyards.\n6\nAs a result of these factors, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company believes that long-term\nprospects for growth in the Oregon wine industry are good. The Company believes that over the next several years, the Oregon wine industry will grow at a\nfaster rate than the overall domestic wine industry, and that much of this growth will favor producers of premium, super premium and ultra-premium wines\nsuch as the Company’s Estate, Elton, Domaine Willamette, Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Griffin Creek brands.\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its ability to: (1) grow and purchase high\nquality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium and ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant brand recognition for its\nwines, first in Oregon and then nationally and internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base\nof direct to consumer sales. The Company’s goal is to continue to build on a reputation for producing some of Oregon’s finest, most sought-after wines.\nBased upon several highly regarded surveys of the U.S. wine industry, the Company believes that successful wineries exhibit the following four key\nattributes: (i) focus on production of high-quality premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietal wines; (ii) achieve brand positioning that supports\nhigh bottle prices for its high quality wines; (iii) build brand recognition; and (iv) develop strong marketing advantages (such as a highly visible winery\nlocations, successful support of distribution, and life-long customer service programs).\nTo successfully execute this strategy, the Company has assembled a team of accomplished winemaking professionals and has constructed and equipped the\nEstate Winery into a 12,784 square foot winery that includes a 12,500 square foot outdoor production area for the harvesting, pressing and fermentation of\nwine grapes.\nThe Company’s marketing and selling strategy is to sell its premium, super premium and ultra-premium cork-finished-wine through a combination of direct\nsales at the Company’s wineries, tasting room and restaurant locations in Oregon, Washington and California and sales through independent distributors\nand wine brokers who market the Company’s wine in specific targeted areas.\nTo remain competitive in the premium, super premium and ultra-premium market, the Company has embarked on a brand expansion project including\ndeveloping a brand and winery in the Walla Walla American Viticultural Area (“AVA”) under the names Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Metis. This future\nwinery is expected to produce small vintages of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals, under the Pambrun brand, and Syrah and other Rhone-\nvarietals, under the Maison Bleue brand, to compete in the ultra-premium wine market. The Company has released wines under the Pambrun label\nbeginning with the 2015 vintage year and Maison Bleue label beginning with the 2016 vintage. Additionally, the Company has developed a single vineyard\nbrand near Hopewell, Oregon adjacent to the current site of Elton Vineyards to produce wine under the Elton label. This brand produces primarily Pinot\nNoir and Chardonnay, also for sale in the ultra-premium space. The Company has released wines under the Elton label beginning with the 2015 vintage\nyear. In 2020, the Company opened a microwinery featuring wine tasting and a custom blending experience under the name Willamette Wineworks, in\nhistoric Folsom, California, and began selling wine under the brand name Natoma. In 2022, the Company opened a sparkling wine facility and tasting room\ncalled Domaine Willamette, at Bernau Estate that features the Company’s sparkling wines, as well as its other reserve wines, and its biodynamic farming\npractices.\n7\nVineyards\nThe Company owns and leases approximately 1,018 acres of land, of which 801 acres are either currently planted as vineyards or are suitable for future\nvineyard planting. The vineyards the Company owns and leases are all certified sustainable by LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology) and Salmon\nSafe. At full production, the Company anticipates these vineyards would enable the Company to grow approximately 73% of the grapes needed to meet the\nwinery’s current production capacity of 654,000 gallons (275,000 cases) at its Estate Winery.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s acreage:\nACRES TONS\nPre- Non-\nVineyard Name Total Producing Production Plantable Plantable 2023 2022\nOwned Vineyards\nWVV Estate 107 69 — — 38 216 206\nTualatin Estate Vineyard 107 61 — — 46 190 279\nIngram Vineyard 86 63 — — 23 178 364\nPambrun Vineyard 87 20 — 30 37 45 49\nLoeza Vineyard 62 20 15 23 4 133 104\nLouisa Vineyard 53 — — 25 28 — —\nMaison Bleue Vineyard 37 15 — 19 3 37 45\nBernau Estate 20 13 — — 7 68 33\nDayton Vineyard 40 — 15 19 6 — —\nLafayette Vineyard 36 — — 36 — — —\nJory Claim Vineyard 69 — 23 42 4 — —\nSub-Total 704 261 53 194 196 867 1,080\nLeased Vineyards\nPeter Michael Vineyard 79 69 — — 10 264 461\nMeadowview Vineyard 49 49 — — — 167 307\nElton Vineyard 59 54 — 2 3 187 198\nIngram Vineyard 110 93 — 17 — 286 463\nBernau Estate 17 9 — — 8 — —\nSub-Total 314 274 — 19 21 904 1,429\nContracted Vineyards*\nVarious 605 605 — — — 2,421 1,307\nTotal 1,623 1,140 53 213 217 4,192 3,816\n* Contracted acreage is estimated\nWVV Estate – Established in 1983, the Company’s Estate Vineyard (the “Estate Vineyard”) is located at the Winery location south of Salem, near Turner,\nOregon. The Estate Vineyard uses an elaborate trellis design known as the Geneva Double Curtain. The Company has incurred the additional expense of\nconstructing this trellis because it doubles the number of canes upon which grape clusters grow and spreads these canes for additional solar exposure and\nair circulation. Research and practical applications of this trellis design indicate that it should improve grape quality through smaller clusters and berries\nover traditional designs.\nTualatin Estate Vineyard – Established in 1973 at the Tualatin Winery location near Forest Grove, Oregon, the Company’s Tualatin Estate Vineyards is one\nof the oldest vineyards in Oregon. It was purchased by the Company in 1997. A series of sale-leaseback transactions split the property into two additional\nvineyards, and the Company continues to lease and manage the Peter Michael Vineyard and Meadowview Vineyard, located adjacent to the Tualatin\nVineyard.\nIngram Estate and Elton Vineyard – In 2008, the Company purchased 86 acres near Hopewell, Oregon, for vineyard plantings. Adjacent to the purchased\nland is an additional 110 leased acres, also for vineyard development. The Company believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Noir. The\nIngram site is also adjacent to Elton Vineyards, where the Company leases 54 acres of established vineyards.\nPambrun Vineyards – In 2015, the Company purchased 42 acres in the Walla Walla AVA near the town of Milton-Freewater, Oregon. Additionally, the\nCompany purchased an additional 45 adjoining acres in 2017. The Company believes this site is ideal to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-\nvarietals. Wines produced from this vineyard are sold under the Pambrun label.\n8\nLoeza Vineyard – The Company purchased 62 acres near Gaston, Oregon in 2014, for vineyard plantings, and believes the site is ideally situated to grow\npremium Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. The site is close to Tualatin Vineyards which allows the Company to leverage existing crews for vineyard development\nand operations.\nLouisa Vineyard – The Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA in 2016 for vineyard plantings and believes the site is suitable for\ngrowing ultra-premium Pinot Noir.\nMaison Bleue Vineyard – The Company purchased approximately 37 acres in the new Rocks District of Milton-Freewater appellation near Milton-\nFreewater, Oregon in 2016. Grapes from this vineyard go to the Maison Bleue label.\nBernau Estate – The Company purchased approximately 17 acres in Dundee, Oregon in January 2017 comprised of 13 acres of producing Pinot Noir.\nAdditionally, the Company added three acres through a lot line adjustment to add to the parcel. The Company leases 17 adjoining acres.\nDayton Vineyard – The Company purchased 40 acres in Dayton, Oregon in December 2016. The Company intends to plant vineyards at this location.\nLafayette Vineyard – The Company purchased 36 acres in Lafayette, Oregon in January 2018. The Company intends to plant vineyards at this location.\nJory Claim Vineyard – The Company purchased 69 acres south of Salem, Oregon in 2019. The Company intends to plant vineyards at this location.\nGrape Vines\nBeginning in 1997, the Company embarked on a major effort to improve the quality of its flagship varietal by planting Pinot Noir clones that originated\ndirectly from the cool climate growing region of Burgundy rather than the previous source of Napa, California, where winemakers believe the variety\nadapted to the warmer climate over the many years it was grown there.\nThese new French clones are called “Dijon clones” after the University of Dijon in Burgundy, which assisted in their selection and shipment to a U.S.\ngovernment authorized quarantine site, and then two years later to Oregon winegrowers. The most desirable of these new Pinot Noir clones are numbered\n113, 114, 115, 667, 777 and 943. In addition to certain flavor advantages, these clones ripen up to two weeks earlier, allowing growers to pick before heavy\nautumn rains. Heavy rains can dilute concentrated fruit flavors and promote bunch rot and spoilage. These Pinot Noir clones were planted at the Tualatin\nVineyards with phylloxera-resistant rootstock and the 667 and 777 clones have been grafted onto seven acres of self-rooted, non-phylloxera-resistant vines\nat the Company’s Estate Vineyard.\nIn 2023, crop yields were roughly 14% below the 10-year average and the Company’s producing acres yielded approximately 867 tons of grapes.\nThe Company fulfills its remaining grape needs by purchasing grapes from other nearby vineyards at competitive prices. In 2023, the Company purchased\nan additional 2,421 tons of grapes from other growers. The Company cannot grow enough grapes to meet anticipated production needs, and therefore\ncontracts grape purchases to make up the difference. Contracted grape purchases are considered an important component of the Company’s long-term\ngrowth and risk-management plan. The Company believes high quality grapes will be available for purchase in sufficient quantity to meet the Company’s\nrequirements. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to plant more acres and purchase properties for future vineyards.\nManagement believes that the grapes grown on the Company’s vineyards establish a foundation of quality through the Company’s farming practices, upon\nwhich the quality of the Company’s wines is built. Wine produced from grapes grown in the Company’s own vineyards may be labeled as “Estate Bottled”\nwines. These wines traditionally sell at a premium over non-estate bottled wines.\nViticultural Conditions\nOregon’s Willamette Valley is recognized as a premier location for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes, particularly Pinot Noir, Pinot\nGris, Chardonnay and Riesling. The Company believes that the Estate Vineyard’s growing conditions, including its soil, elevation, slope, rainfall, evening\nmarine breezes and solar orientation are among the most ideal conditions in the United States for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes. The\nEstate Vineyard’s grape growing conditions compare favorably to those found in some of the famous Viticultural regions of France. Western Oregon’s\nlatitude (42o–46o North) and relationship to the eastern edge of a major ocean is very similar to certain centuries-old wine grape growing regions of France,\nsuch as Burgundy.\nIn the Willamette Valley, permanent vineyard irrigation is generally not required. The average annual rainfall provides sufficient moisture to avoid the need\nto irrigate. However, if the need should arise, the Company’s Estate property contains one water well which can sustain sufficient volume to meet the needs\nof the Winery and to provide auxiliary water to the WVV Estate Vineyard for new plantings and unusual drought conditions. At the Tualatin Vineyard, the\nCompany has water rights to a year-round spring that feeds an irrigation pond. The Company also has water rights at each of the Pambrun and Maison\nBleue Vineyards.\n9\nSusceptibility of vineyards to disease – The Tualatin Estate Vineyard and the adjacent leased vineyards are known to be infested with phylloxera, an aphid-\nlike insect, which can destroy vines.\nIt is not possible to estimate any range of loss that may be incurred due to the phylloxera infestation of the Company’s vineyards. The phylloxera at\nTualatin Vineyard is believed to have been introduced on the roots of the vines first planted on the property in the southern-most section Gewurztraminer in\n1971 that the Company partially removed in 2004. The remaining vines, and all others infested, remain productive at low crop levels. The Company is in\nthe process of gradually replacing infested areas with new, phylloxera-resistant vines.\nWinery\nWine production facility – The Company’s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing up to 275,000 cases (654,000\ngallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2023, the Winery produced approximately 234,086 cases (556,700 gallons) of wine,\nprimarily from its 2021 and 2022 harvest.\nThe Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging and bottling wine, as well as an underground wine cellar and\nadministrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes. The Company also has a\n23,000 square foot storage building to store its inventory of bottled product with a capacity of approximately 135,000 cases of wine. The production area is\nequipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in compliance with environmental regulations.\nIn addition to the production capacity discussed above, the Tualatin Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately 28,000\ncases (66,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The capacity at the Tualatin Winery is available to the Company to meet any\nanticipated future production needs. The Company also stores and ages product at the Domaine Willamette Winery location in Dundee, Oregon.\nMortgages on properties – The Company’s winery facilities at the Estate Winery are subject to two mortgages with an aggregate principal balance of\n$4,565,710 at December 31, 2023. The two outstanding loans require aggregate monthly principal and interest payments of $62,067 for the life of the\nloans, at annual fixed interest rates of 4.75% and 5.21%, and with maturity dates of 2028 and 2032, respectively.\nWine production – The Company operates on the principle that winemaking is a natural, but highly technical, process requiring the attention and dedication\nof the winemaking staff. The Company’s Winery is equipped with current technical innovations and uses modern equipment and software to monitor the\nprogress of each wine through all stages of the winemaking process.\nThe Company’s historical annual grape harvest and wine production from 2005 to 2023 is as follows:\nTons of Tons of Total Tons Gallons of\nHarvest Grapes Grapes of Grapes Bulk Production Cases\nYear Grown Purchased Harvested Purchases Year Produced\n2005 1,107 25 1,132 - 2005 72,297\n2006 1,454 34 1,488 - 2006 81,081\n2007 850 896 1,746 - 2007 115,466\n2008 551 874 1,425 57,736 2008 121,027\n2009 1,033 1,100 2,133 74,954 2009 132,072\n2010 674 371 1,045 4,276 2010 110,224\n2011 718 609 1,327 9,620 2011 81,357\n2012 658 670 1,328 7,910 2012 91,181\n2013 755 1,020 1,775 6,257 2013 95,638\n2014 1,211 970 2,181 520 2014 108,958\n2015 1,266 1,012 2,278 - 2015 120,794\n2016 921 1,052 1,973 47,780 2016 141,416\n2017 1,631 1,622 3,253 15,900 2017 151,332\n2018 1,501 1,063 2,564 800 2018 164,590\n2019 1,572 1,046 2,618 - 2019 172,869\n2020 1,031 1,470 2,501 13,173 2020 175,357\n2021 1,550 1,522 3,072 6,643 2021 206,954\n2022 2,509 1,307 3,816 22,000 2022 186,792\n2023 1,771 2,421 4,192 11,236 2023 234,086\nCases produced per ton harvested vary between years mainly due to the timing of when the cases are produced.\n10\nSales and Distribution\nMarketing strategy – The Company markets and sells its wines through a combination of direct sales at the retail locations, directly through mailing lists,\nand through distributors and wine brokers. As the Company has increased production volumes and achieved greater brand recognition, sales to out of state\nmarkets have increased, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total Company sales.\nThe Company uses a variety of marketing channels to generate interest in its wines. The Company has a highly functional website, and maintains social\nmedia sites. The Company controls a database of customers for email and direct promotions. The Company continues to submit its wines to competitions\nand state, regional and national media for editorials and ratings.\nDirect sales – The Estate Winery is located on a visible hill adjacent to Oregon’s major north-south freeway (Interstate 5), approximately 2 miles south of\nthe state’s second-largest metropolitan area (Salem), and 50 miles in either direction from the state’s first and third-largest metropolitan areas (Portland and\nEugene). We believe the unique location along Interstate 5 has resulted in a greater amount of wines sold at the Estate Winery as compared to the Oregon\nindustry standard. Direct sales from the Winery are a vital sales channel and an effective means of product promotion. The Estate Winery’s Tasting Room is\nopen daily and offers wine tasting and education by trained personnel. The Company offers by-appointment private tours offering a behind-the-scenes look\nat the production process of the wines. The Company has one of the largest wine club memberships in Oregon.\nIn September 2022, the Company opened a new sparkling winery, the Domaine Willamette Winery, located adjacent to Highway 99 in Dundee, Oregon,\napproximately 30 miles southwest of Portland, the state’s largest metropolitan area, and 25 miles northwest of Salem, the state’s second-largest\nmetropolitan area. We believe the location of the Domaine Willamette Winery along Highway 99 in Dundee provides an ideal location for direct wine sales\nand wine tourism. Domaine Willamette Winery’s Tasting Room is open for wine tasting, restaurant service and education by trained personnel. It features\nméthode traditionelle sparkling wines and a wine club. The Company offers by-appointment private tours, giving a behind-the-scenes look at sparkling\nwine production. Domaine Willamette Winery’s biodynamic garden is another attraction for visitors.\n11\nIn 2014, the Company launched daily food pairings to accompany its wines. Led by the Winery Chef, the menu highlights Pacific Northwest inspired\ndishes paired with the Company’s wines. The culinary offering has now expanded to include “Pairings Wine Dinners,” which are community-style wine\ndinners hosted regularly throughout each month. In 2019, the Company added a new experience offered throughout the week called Pairings Exploration\nthat features four wines paired with four small bites to educate guests on food and wine pairing. In December 2021, the Company debuted a Pinot Noir\nClonal Blending experience giving guests the ability to be a winemaker for a day by crafting their own custom blends from barrel.\nThe Winery has developed a Winery Ambassador program, which connects its “Ambassadors” with customers throughout the United States and offers\npersonalized wine recommendations and easy ordering by phone or email. The Company sells its wine through its own e-commerce website and direct\nships where permissible.\nThe Company also operates eight additional tasting rooms at the following locations: (i) historic downtown McMinnville, Oregon; (ii) at its Tualatin\nVineyard, Oregon; (iii) Lake Oswego, Oregon; (iv) Happy Valley, Oregon; (v) downtown Walla Walla, Washington; (vi) Vancouver, Washington; (vii)\nFolsom, California, and (viii) Bend, Oregon.\nThe Company holds various festivals and events at its locations throughout the year. Numerous private events, charitable and political events are also held\nat Company locations.\nDirect sales produce a higher profit margin because the Company can sell its wine directly to consumers at retail prices, rather than to distributors at free-\non-board prices. Sales made directly to consumers at retail prices result in an increased profit margin equal to the difference between retail prices and\ndistributor prices. For 2023 and 2022, direct sales contributed approximately 52.4% and 46.4% of the Company’s net sales, respectively.\nDistributors and wine brokers – The Company uses both independent distributors and wine brokers, primarily to market the Company’s wines in specific\ntargeted areas. Only those distributors and wine brokers who have demonstrated knowledge of and a proven ability to market premium, super premium, and\nultra-premium wines are utilized. The Company’s products are distributed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, and there are three non-domestic\n(export) customers. For 2023 and 2022, sales to distributors and wine brokers contributed approximately 47.6% and 53.6% of the Company’s revenue from\noperations, respectively.\nTourists – Oregon wineries are a popular tourist destination with many bed & breakfasts, motels and fine dining restaurants available. The Willamette\nValley, Oregon’s leading wine region has approximately 69% of the state’s wineries and vineyards, is home to approximately 1,016 wineries. An additional\nadvantage for Willamette Valley wine tourism is the proximity of the wineries to Portland (Oregon’s largest city and most popular destination). From\nPortland, tourists can visit the Willamette Valley winery of their choice in anywhere from a 45 minute to a two-hour drive.\nThe Company believes the locations of the Estate Winery next to Interstate 5, and the Domaine Willamette Winery next to Highway 99W, significantly\nincrease direct sales opportunities to consumers. The Company believes these locations provide high visibility for the Company to passing motorists,\nenhancing recognition of the Company’s products in retail outlets and restaurants. These wineries are each an approximately 45-minute drive from\nPortland, the state’s largest metropolitan area.\nDependence on Major Customers\nHistorically, the Company’s revenue has been derived from thousands of customers annually. In 2023, sales to one distributor represented approximately\n14.5% of total Company revenue. In 2022, sales to one distributor represented approximately 17.5% of total Company revenue.\n12\nCompetition\nThe wine industry is highly competitive. In a broad sense, wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Within the\nwine industry, the Company believes that its principal competitors include wineries in Oregon, California, and Washington, which, like the Company,\nproduce premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines. Wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have\nsignificantly greater financial, production, distribution, and marketing resources than the Company. Currently, no Oregon winery dominates the Oregon\nwine market. There are several Oregon wineries that are older, better established and have greater label recognition than that of the Company.\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the premium, super premium, and ultra-premium segment of the wine industry are product\nquality, price, label recognition, and product supply. The Company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors. The Company has\nprimarily received “Excellent” to “Recommended” reviews in tastings of its wines and believes its prices are competitive with other Oregon wineries.\nLarger scale production is necessary to satisfy retailers’ and restaurants’ demand and the Company believes that additional production capacity will be\nneeded to meet estimated future demand. Furthermore, the Company believes that its estimated aggregate production capacity of 720,000 gallons (303,000\ncases) per year at its Estate and Tualatin locations give it significant competitive advantages over most Oregon wineries in areas such as marketing,\ndistribution arrangements, grape purchasing, and access to financing. The current production level of most Oregon wineries is generally much smaller than\nthe estimated production capacity level of the Company’s Wineries. With respect to label recognition, the Company believes that its unique structure as a\npublicly owned company will give it a significant advantage in gaining market share in Oregon, as well as penetrating other wine markets.\nGovernmental Regulation of the Wine Industry\nThe production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the\n“TTB”) and the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (the “OLCC”). The Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of\nthese governmental agencies. Sale of the Company’s wine is subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of a\nwinery for shipment to customers or for sale in its tasting room.\nIn December 2017, the federal government passed comprehensive tax legislation which included the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act.\nThis legislation modified federal alcohol tax rates by expanding the lower $1.07 per gallon tax rate to wines up to 16.0% alcohol content with wines\ncontaining higher alcohol levels being taxed at $1.57 per gallon. Additionally, the legislation provides for a $1 credit per gallon for the first 30,000 gallons\nproduced; $0.90 for the next 100,000 gallons; and then $0.535 for up to 750,000 gallons. These modifications were effective January 2020 and have since\nbeen made permanent.\nThe Company also pays the state of Oregon an excise tax of $0.67 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0% and $0.77 per gallon for\nwines with alcohol content above 14.0% on all wine sold in Oregon. In addition, most states in which the Company’s wines are sold impose varying excise\ntaxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. As an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and, as a\nproducer of wastewater, by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The Company has secured all necessary permits to operate its business.\nPrompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could\npotentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if\npassed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall\nsales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the\nsame in every state.\nCosts and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws\nThe Company management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the\nenvironment, the public and consumers of its wine. Although much of the Company’s expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, the Company\nis regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws. However, these regulatory costs and processes are effectively\nintegrated into the Company’s regular operations and consequently, do not generally cause significant alternative processes or costs.\n13\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 223 full-time employees and 123 part-time, or “on call” employees. In addition, the Company\nhires additional employees for seasonal work as required. The Company’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company\nbelieves it maintains positive relations with its employees.\nAdditional Information\nThe Company files Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other\ninformation regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. You may learn more about the Company by\nvisiting the Company’s website at www.wvv.com. All of the reports we file with the SEC are available from this website. All websites referred to herein are\ninactive textual references only, meaning that the information contained in such websites is not incorporated by reference herein.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the Company’s business as they appear to\nmanagement at this time, however, this list is not exhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from time to time.\nAgricultural risks could adversely affect the Company\nWinemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, including Grapevine Red Blotch\nDisease (“GRBV”), drought, frost and certain other weather conditions can affect the quantity of grapes available to the Company, decreasing the supply of\nthe Company’s products and negatively impacting profitability. In particular, certain of the Company’s vines are not resistant to phylloxera; accordingly,\nthose vines are particularly at risk to the effects from an infestation of phylloxera. Phylloxera is a pest that attacks the rootstocks of wine grape plants.\nVineyards in the United States, including some in Oregon and some owned by us, have been infested with phylloxera. In particular, Tualatin Estate\nVineyards have phylloxera. There can be no assurance that the Company’s existing vineyards, or the rootstocks the Company is now using in its planting\nprograms, will not become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera or that the phylloxera present at the Tualatin Vineyards will not spread to our\nother vineyards. Pierce’s Disease is a vine bacterial disease. It kills grapevines and there is no known cure. Small insects called Sharpshooters spread this\ndisease. A new strain of the Sharpshooter was discovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north. The Company is actively supporting\nthe efforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to prevent an infestation in its own vineyards. The\nCompany cannot, however, guarantee that it will succeed in preventing contamination in its vineyards. Additionally, any future government restrictions\ncreated in connection with government attempts to combat phylloxera, GRBV or other pests or viruses may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce\nproduction.\nOur operations are susceptible to changing weather patterns and other environmental factors\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as\nhailstorms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. Any such extreme weather condition could negatively impact the harvest of grapes at our vineyards\nand/or the other vineyards that supply us with grapes for our wine. Oregon’s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern, particularly in early\nautumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished,\nthereby affecting that year’s wine quality.\n14\nAdditionally, long-term changes in weather patterns could adversely affect the Company, especially if such changes impacted the amount or quality of\ngrapes harvested. We cannot anticipate changes in weather patterns/conditions, and we cannot predict their impact on our operations if they were to occur.\nAs weather patterns evolve, the Company’s vineyards, and contracted vineyards have become susceptible to potential smoke damage as a result of wildfires\nwithin the region. In extreme events, smoke can produce effects on grapes that make them unusable in the production of wine. The Company cannot predict\nsmoke events, or the potential impact if such events were to occur.\nWe may not be able to economically insure certain risks\nThe Company maintains insurance policies to cover certain risks. However not all risks can be insured, or insured economically, and there may be gaps in\ncoverage that could expose the Company to liability should an event occur. Additionally, we cannot be certain that coverage levels are adequate or that all\nof our insurers will be financially viable if we make a claim.\nLoss of key employees could harm the Company’s reputation and business\nThe Company’s success depends to some degree upon the continued service of a number of key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these\nkey employees, including James W. Bernau, our President and Chief Executive Officer and John Ferry, our Chief Financial Officer could harm the\nCompany and its reputation and negatively impact its profitability, particularly if one or more of the Company’s key employees resigns to join a competitor\nor to form a competing company.\nThe Company’s ability to operate requires adequate funding\nThe Company’s cash flow from operations historically has not been sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Company’s operations. The Company\nhas entered into a line of credit agreement to provide such funds and entered into term loan arrangements. There is no assurance that the Company will be\nable to comply with all conditions under its credit facilities in the future or that the amount available under its line of credit facility or capital raises will be\nadequate for the Company’s future needs. Failure to comply with all conditions of the credit facilities, or to have sufficient funds for operations could\nadversely affect the Company’s results of operations and stockholder value.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding long-term debt was approximately $7.6 million, with $2.7 million drawn under its short-term line of\ncredit. Additionally, the Company had notes payable to private parties of approximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCosts of being a publicly-held company may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage\nAs a public company, the Company incurs substantial costs that are not incurred by its competitors that are privately-held. These compliance costs may\nresult in the Company’s wines being more expensive than those produced by its competitors and/or may reduce profitability compared to such competitors.\nThe Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability\nThe wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. The Company’s wines compete in several premium wine market segments with many\nother premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well as Italy, Chile,\nArgentina, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The Company’s wines also compete with popular generic wines and with other alcoholic and, to a\nlesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by the Company’s independent distributors, many of which\ncarry extensive brand portfolios. One result of this intense competition has been upward pressure on the Company’s selling and promotional expenses. In\naddition, the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation. Many of the Company’s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, and\npublic relations resources than the Company does. In particular, wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have\nsignificantly greater resources than the Company. Additionally, greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give many of the\nCompany’s competitors certain unit cost advantages. Company sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to compete successfully against such wine\nor alternative beverage producers’ costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully compete with its current\ncompetitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage manufacturers.\n15\nThe Willamette Valley AVA value may be eroded by out of state competition who use it inappropriately or as fanciful marketing\nWine grape growing regions in the United States are divided into AVA) by the United States Department of the Treasury’s TTB, based on distinguishable\ngeographic features. The Oregon wine industry has historically embraced higher standards for wine production than those established by the federal\ngovernment and other states. As a result, wines from Oregon AVA’s, and specifically the Willamette Valley AVA, have achieved recognition for their quality\nwhen compared against other wines in their class. As a result, these Oregon wines are often sold at a higher price point than wines not produced in Oregon.\nBecause of this recognition, out of state competitors have inappropriately used Oregon AVAs on bottles and packaging, claiming its use as fanciful\nmarketing. Such use, inappropriate or otherwise, could have a dilutive effect on the prestige of Oregon AVAs and ultimately the prices that can be charged\nfor wines from Oregon AVAs as a result of reduced competitor quality and/or pricing.\nThe Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most of whom carry extensive product\nportfolios\nNationwide, the Company sells its products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets, restaurants, hotels, and\nprivate clubs across the United States and in some overseas markets. Sales to distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of the\nCompany’s net revenue in the future. A change in the relationship with any of the Company’s significant distributors could harm the Company’s business\nand reduce Company sales. The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making\nit difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace\ndistributors, poor performance of the Company’s major distributors or the Company’s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major distributors\ncould harm the Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to purchase the\nCompany’s products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support. Consolidation at the retail tier, among club and chain\ngrocery stores in particular, can be expected to heighten competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain or reduce prices.\nLoss of the “Willamette Valley Vineyards” or “Willamette” trademarks could adversely affect the Company’s distinction within the AVA\nThe Company has long held the federal trademarks “Willamette Valley Vineyards” and “Willamette”, as used in its wine brands. While it is lawful for wine\nproducers meeting the federal and state requirements to list the “Willamette Valley” AVA source of their wine grapes and wine on their labels, packaging\nand advertising materials, the Company has enforced its trademarks on any unauthorized use as a wine brand.\nFluctuations in quantity and quality of grape supply could adversely affect the Company\nA shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity of the Company’s grape supply,\nincluding weather conditions, pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy grapes on long and short term contracts and the number of vines\nproducing grapes. Any shortage in the Company’s grape production could cause a reduction in the amount of wine the Company is able to produce, which\ncould reduce sales and adversely impact the Company’s results from operations. Factors that reduce the quantity of the Company’s grapes may also reduce\ntheir quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount of wine the Company produces. Deterioration in the quality of the Company’s wines could\nharm its brand name and could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.\n16\nContamination of the Company’s wines would harm the Company’s business\nThe Company is subject to certain hazards and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through tampering or otherwise, of ingredients or\nproducts. Contamination of any of the Company’s wines could cause it to destroy its wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall,\nwhich could significantly damage the Company’s reputation for product quality. The Company maintains insurance against certain of these kinds of risks,\nand others, under various insurance policies. However, the insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are\nsatisfactory to the Company and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.\nA reduction in consumer demand for premium wines could harm the Company’s business\nThere have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the\nUnited States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the Company’s product\ncategories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic conditions; increased concern about the health\nconsequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie\nbeverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign\nexcise and other taxes on beverage alcohol products. The competitive position of the Company’s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to\nachieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.\nChanges in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and business results\nWine sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of the economy, federal and state income\ntax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state tax laws, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nChanges in consumer spending in these and other regions can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that customers are willing to purchase at\nrestaurants or through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for the Company’s products, limitations on\nthe Company’s ability to increase prices and increased levels of selling and promotional expenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact\nupon the Company’s sales and profit margins.\nIncreased regulation and/or taxation could adversely affect the Company\nThe wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the TTB and various foreign agencies, state liquor authorities (such as the OLCC) and local\nauthorities. These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements, trade, and pricing practices, permitted distribution channels,\npermitted and required labeling, and advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Any expansion of the Company’s existing facilities or\ndevelopment of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions, and other legal\nrequirements. In addition, new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, income taxes, property and sales taxes or international tariffs, could\nnegatively affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Recently, many states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these\nstates have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. Additionally, many states have revised, or are revising, statutes that broaden the definition of nexus to\nincrease tax revenue from out of state businesses.\nNew or revised regulations, or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or\nresults of operations. There can be no assurance that new or revised regulations, taxes or increased licensing fees and requirements will not have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business and its results of operations and its cash flows.\nThe Company’s common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments.\nThe trading volume of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) is consistently “thin,” in that\nthere is not a great deal of trading activity on a daily basis. Because the average active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to\nsell their shares of the Company’s common stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other publicly\ntraded companies.\n17\nThe Company may face liabilities associated with the offer and sale of its Preferred Stock.\nIn August 2015, the Company commenced a public offering of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) pursuant to a registration\nstatement filed with the SEC. The Company registered this transaction with the securities authorities of the States of Oregon and Washington and, in\nNovember 2015, achieved listing status for the Preferred Stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol “WVVIP”. The terms of our Preferred Stock are\nunusual for a company of our size, and we believe the structure of these securities and of the offering is not commonplace among issuers. Federal and state\nsecurities laws impose significant liabilities on issuers of securities if the related offering documents contain material misstatements of fact, or if the\ndocuments omit to state facts necessary, in light of the circumstances as a whole, to prevent the documents from being misleading. These liabilities can\ninclude rescission liability to the purchasers of the securities, as well as potential enforcement liability that could give rise to civil money penalties.\nSecurities litigation can be extraordinarily expensive and protracted, and if we are accused of misstatements or omissions in our offering documents, we\nmay face economic harms and management distractions regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such litigation. Further, if we ultimately are adjudged to\nhave actually made a material misstatement or omission, the Company may be liable for the repayment of the purchase price of the related securities, plus\ninterest from the date of purchase. Any one or more of these events or circumstances would have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, and may make it more difficult or more expensive to undertake capital-raising efforts in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to pay accumulated dividends on its Preferred Stock.\nThe Company’s Preferred Stock bears a cumulative 5.3% dividend based upon the original issue price, or $0.22 per share per annum. However, prior to the\ndeclaration and payment of dividends our board of directors must determine, among other things, that funds are available out of the surplus of the Company\nand that the payment would not render us insolvent or compromise our ability to pay our obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business.\nAdditionally, our existing credit facility limits, and future debt obligations in the future may limit, both our legal and our practical ability to declare and pay\ndividends. As a result, although the Preferred Stock will continue to earn a right to receive dividends, the Company’s ability to pay dividends will depend,\namong other things, upon our ability to generate excess cash. However, although shares of our Preferred Stock will earn cumulative dividends, unpaid\ndividends will not, themselves, accumulate (as might compounding interest on a debt security, for example).\nAs the Company’s sales revenues are dependent in part upon the purchases made by and continued goodwill with its holders of Preferred Stock, any failure\nto pay dividends timely could adversely effect the Company’s sales. Additionally, as the Company focuses its issuance of Preferred Stock to wine\nenthusiasts likely to purchase the Company’s wines, any failure by management to successfully target its stock sales could diminish the opportunity to\nmaximize earnings and offset the administrative, regulatory, and legal costs of this form of capital formation through preferred stockholder wine purchases.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our Preferred Stock or Common Stock in the future could adversely affect holders of Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be influenced by any preferred stock we may issue. Our board of directors is authorized to issue additional\nclasses or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. This includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series\nof preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over Common Stock with respect to the liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of the business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Common Stock with respect\nto liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of\nholders of the Common Stock or the market price of the Common Stock could be adversely affected.\n18\nFailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on\nour business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers, and suppliers as well as for administrative functions and many\nof such technology systems are independent of one another for their functionality. We also use information technologies to process financial information\nand results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for\nsome of these information technologies and support. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of\nour products is highly dependent on our technology systems. Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our\nthird party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or\nreplacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-\nattacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any\nsuch interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal\npenalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting\nrepercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll,\naccounting, and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service\nproviders, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and\npersonnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as\nbusiness plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s\ninformation technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers’ or personnel’s data or\nconfidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods could result in a violation of\napplicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure\nto material liability.\nThe provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a\npremium for our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even\nif that transaction could be beneficial to stockholders. These impediments include, but are not limited to; the classification of our Board of Directors (the\n“Board”) into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, which makes it more difficult to quickly replace Board members; the ability of our Board,\nsubject to certain limitations under the NASDAQ rules, to issue shares of Preferred Stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;\na provision that special meetings of our Board may be called only by our chief executive officer or at the request of holders of not less than half of all\noutstanding shares of our common stock; a provision that any member of the Board, or the entire Board, may be removed from office only for cause; and a\nprovision that our stockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders.\nThe Board may implement other changes that further limit the potential for tender offers or takeover attempts.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nThe Company has not adopted any formal cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material\nrisks from cybersecurity threats. The full board of directors has oversight responsibility for the Company’s overall risk management, including\ncybersecurity risk, and has not delegated oversight authority for cybersecurity risks to any committee. In fiscal year 2023, we did not identify any\ncybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nVineyards – The Company owns or leases 1,018 acres of land, of which 704 acres is owned and 314 acres leased. Of the 1,018 acres of land owned or\nleased, 535 acres are productive vineyards, 266 acres are pre-productive vineyards or are suitable for future vineyard plantings, and 217 acres are not\nsuitable for vineyard planting or are used or reserved for winery or hospitality purposes. See Item 1 Business - Vineyards, of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the locations of each of the Company’s vineyards (both owned and leased) and other information pertaining to the production capacity, harvest\ntotals and other important characteristics of each such vineyard.\n19\nWine production facility – We believe the Company’s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing up to 275,000 cases\n(654,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2023, the Winery produced approximately 234,086 cases (556,551 gallons)\nof wine, mostly from its 2022 and 2021 harvest. The Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging, and bottling\nwine, as well as an underground wine cellar, meeting rooms, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area for\nharvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes. The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage building to store its inventory of bottled product. The\nproduction area is equipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in compliance with\nenvironmental regulations. The Company’s main hospitality Center is located at the Company’s Estate Winery (the “Hospitality Center”) and is a large\n35,642 square foot tasting and hospitality facility. The Hospitality Center sits above the underground barrel cellar and tunnel that connects with the Winery.\nThe facility includes a basement cellar, tunnel, and barrel room of 11,090 square feet used to store up to 1,800 barrels of wine for aging in the proper\nenvironment.\nThe Company-owned Tualatin Estate Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately 28,000 cases (66,000 gallons) of wine\nproduction capacity to the Company. The production capacity at the Tualatin Estate Winery is not currently used, but is available to the Company to meet\nfuture production needs. The storage capacity at the Tualatin Estate Winery is periodically used to store excess bulk wine. Additionally, the Company\noperates a small retail store and tasting room at the Tualatin Estate Winery.\nThe Company-owned sparkling winery, Domaine Willamette, is located adjacent to Highway 99 in Dundee, Oregon, at Bernau Estate. Bernau Estate also\nfeatures a tasting room and restaurant, retail bottle shop and residence, in addition to the winery.\nThe Company carries Property and Liability insurance coverage in amounts deemed adequate by management.\nFor additional discussion of vineyard and wine production facilities, see Item 1. Business.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nAlthough the Company from time to time may be involved with disputes, claims and litigation related to the conduct of its business, there are no material\nlegal proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject, and the Company’s management does not know of\nany such action being contemplated.\nITEM 4.

[RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s\nfinancial statements and related notes. Some statements and information contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of\nimportant factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see “Cautionary Note on\nForward-Looking Statements.”\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting\npolicies are those most critical to the judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses Willamette Valley Vineyards’ financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As such, management is required to make certain estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its\nestimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, leases, investments, income taxes, financing operations, and\ncontingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue – The Company’s principal sources of revenue are derived from direct sales and sales through distributors of wine. Distributor sales are\nrecognized from wine sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. The Company’s payment arrangements with wholesalers provide primarily 30-day\nterms and, to a limited extent, 45-day, 60-day, or longer terms for some international wholesalers. Direct sales through the Company’s tasting rooms are\nrecognized at the point of sales. Sales through the internet and wine club sales are recognized when the product has shipped to the customer.\nThe Company pays depletion allowances to the Company’s distributors based on their sales to their customers. The Company sets these allowances on a\nmonthly basis and the Company’s distributors bill them back on a monthly basis. All depletion expenses associated with a given month are recognized in\nthat month as a reduction of revenues. The Company also reimburses for samples used by distributors up to 1.5% of product sold to the distributors.\nSample expenses are recognized at the time the Company is billed by the distributor as a selling, general and administrative expense.\n21\nAmounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling expenses are included in the net revenue. Expenses incurred for outbound shipping\nand handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense.\nInventory – The Company values inventories at the lower of actual cost to produce the inventory or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews\ninventory quantities on hand and adjusts its production requirements for the next twelve months based on estimated forecasts of product demand. A\nsignificant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In the future, if the Company’s inventory\ncost is determined to be greater than the net realizable value of the inventory upon sale, the Company would be required to recognize such excess costs in\nits cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Therefore, although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of\nfuture product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the ultimate selling price and cases sold and,\ntherefore, the carrying value of the Company’s inventory and its reported operating results.\nAdditionally, the Company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and marketability and if it determines that the inventory is obsolete, or no longer\nsuitable for use or marketable, the cost of that inventory is recognized in cost of sales at the time of such determination.\nVineyard Development – The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs prior to the vineyard land becoming fully productive. These costs\nconsist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises. Amortization of\nsuch costs as annual crop costs is done on a straight-line basis for the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years. The\nCompany regularly evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs. Amortization of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that\nin turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold.\nIncome Taxes – The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the\napplicable tax rates. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance against those assets, if available evidence suggests that\nsome of those assets will not be realized.\nThe effect of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the\nuncertain tax positions would withstand an examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As facts and circumstances\nchange, management reassesses these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.\nOverview\nThe Company generates revenue from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. The Company is experiencing increased levels of\ncompetition in traditional wholesale to retail grocery distribution from large California based wineries that are acquiring, producing, and marketing Oregon\nbranded wines. Direct to consumer sales primarily include sales through the Company’s tasting rooms and wine club. Direct to consumer sales provide a\nhigher gross profit to the Company due to prices received being closer to retail than those prices paid by wholesalers. The Company continues to emphasize\ngrowth in direct-to-consumer sales through use of the Hospitality Center, opening new tasting rooms and growth in wine club membership. The Company\nhad 11,541 wine club memberships for the year ended December 31, 2023, a net increase of 1,540 when compared to 2022. Additionally, the Company’s\nPreferred Stock sales since August 2015 have resulted in approximately 14,385 preferred stockholders, many of which the Company believes are wine\nenthusiasts. When considering joint ownership, we believe these new shareholders represent approximately 21,577 potential customers of the Company.\nThe Company also has approximately 3,177 shareholders of Common Stock which we believe represent an estimated 4,765 potential customers when\nconsidering joint ownership. Additionally, the Company has made a significant investment in developing alternative wine brands, products, direct sales\nmethods, and locations.\n22\nPeriodically, the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, which primarily consist of inventory that does not meet Company standards or is in excess of\nproduction targets. However, this activity is not a significant part of the Company’s activities.\nThe Company sold approximately 191,619 and 187,371 cases of produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an\nincrease of 4,248 cases, or 2.3% in the current year over the prior year. The increase in case sales was the result of more direct to consumer sales in 2023\nwhen compared to 2022.\nCost of Sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling, packaging,\nwarehousing, and shipping and handling costs associated with purchased production materials. For grapes grown at Company vineyards, costs include\nfarming expenditures and amortization of vineyard development costs.\nAt December 31, 2023, wine inventory included 131,647 cases of bottled wine and 785,363 gallons of bulk wine in various stages of the aging process.\nCased wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months (and generally before the release date of the next vintage). The Winery bottled 234,086\ncases during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\n2023 compared to 2022\nNet loss was $1,198,593 and $646,492, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $552,101, or 85.4%, for the year\nended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was a higher gross profit from additional sales revenue, being\nmore than offset by higher operating expenses. This was primarily related to higher tasting room expenses as a result of some locations being open for\nlonger for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the previous year.\nNet loss applicable to common shareholders was $3,245,690 and $2,512,943, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of\n$732,747, or 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by a higher net loss and higher\npreferred stock dividends.\nThe Company had net sales revenues of $39,136,114 and $33,934,081 for the years December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $5,202,033,\nor 15.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from direct sales of $4,786,730,\nor 30.4% in 2023 compared to 2022, and an increase in revenue from sales to distributors of $415,303 or 2.3% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer retail sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to distributors. During\n2023, revenues from retail sales increased 31.0%, revenues from in-state sales decreased 5.0%, and revenues from out-of-state sales increased 6.1%,\ncompared to 2022.\nDirect sales included $69,924 and $97,652 of bulk wine and grape sales in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and represented\napproximately 52.4% and 46.4% of the Company’s total revenue for 2023 and 2022, respectively, while the Company’s remaining revenues came from\nsales through distributors.\n23\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s revenue, excluding excise taxes, from the Winery’s operations for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nRetail sales $ 20,680,024 $ 15,786,241\nIn-state sales 5,686,517 5,987,410\nOut-of-state sales 13,131,363 12,374,881\nBulk wine/miscellaneous sales 69,924 97,652\nTotal revenue 39,567,828 34,246,184\nLess excise taxes (431,714) (312,103)\nSales, net $ 39,136,114 $ 33,934,081\nRetail sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $20,680,024 and $15,786,241 respectively, an increase of $4,893,783, or\n31.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The increase in retail sales revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly a\nresult of increased revenues from new retail locations being open for longer during 2023.\nBulk Wine/miscellaneous sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $69,924 and $97,652, respectively, a decrease of $27,728,\nor 28.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, over the prior year period.\nIn-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $5,686,517 and $5,987,410, respectively, a decrease of $300,893, or 5.0%,\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nOut-of-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $13,131,363 and $12,374,881, respectively, an increase of $756,482, or\n6.1%.\nThe Company pays alcohol excise taxes to both the OLCC and to the TTB. These taxes are based on product sales volumes. The Company is liable for the\ntaxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton\nbasis to the OLCC for the Oregon Wine Board. The Company’s excise related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $431,714 and\n$312,103, respectively, an increase of $119,611, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was due primarily to a\nlarger crop processed and the timing of removals in 2023.\nCost of Sales was $16,578,986 and $15,119,985 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $1,459,001, or 9.6%, for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, over the prior year period. This change was primarily the result of increased sales and the mix of sales between direct and\ndistributors between the two periods.\nGross profit was $22,557,128 and $18,814,096 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $3,743,032 or 19.9%, for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was generally driven by an increase in sales revenues in 2023.\nThe gross margin percentage was 57.6% and 55.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 2.2 percentage points, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily the result of higher direct sales\nprices and more sales coming from direct to consumer sales in 2023.\n24\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $23,764,330 and $19,360,514 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase\nof $4,403,816, or 22.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was primarily as a result of more sales coming\nfrom tasting rooms which have higher selling costs and from newer locations being open for longer in 2023.\nLoss from operations was $1,207,202 and $546,418 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $660,784, or 120.9%, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. This increase included higher depreciation costs of $1,232,459 in 2023 mostly\nrelating to the investment in new locations.\nInterest income was $27 and $5,496 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $5,469 for the year ended December 31,\n2023 over the prior year. Interest expense was $594,106 and $367,745 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of\n$226,361, or 61.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to the increase in\naverage loan balances in 2023 compared to the previous year.\nOther income, net, was $114,827 and $142,529 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $27,702, or 19.4%, for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period.\nProvision for income tax benefit was $487,861 and $119,646 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $368,215, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase in income tax benefit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily the result of a\nhigher loss from operations in 2023 and an increase in the effective tax rate in 2023.\nLoss per common share after preferred dividends was $0.65 and $0.51 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $0.14,\nor 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was an increase in net loss and higher\npreferred stock dividends in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe Company had cash balances of $238,482 at December 31, 2023, and $338,676 at December 31, 2022. The Company had an outstanding line of credit\nbalance of $2,684,982 at December 31, 2023, and $166,617 at December 31, 2022. The Company had a bank overdraft of $393,416 at December 31, 2023,\nand no overdraft at December 31, 2022.\nEBITDA\nIn 2023, the Company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) increased 22.1% to $2,334,602 from $1,912,012 in\n2022, primarily as a result of increased depreciation costs in 2023.\nEBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial\nperformance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as “GAAP”, and should not be considered as\nan alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations as a measure of performance, nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities\nas a measure of liquidity. We use EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of our own operating results and as a benchmark relative to our competitors. We\nconsider it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income (loss) as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expense\nare not actual cash costs, and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the\nunderlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities.\nEBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our GAAP results as\nreported. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a\nmeasure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. See the Statement of Cash Flows set out in our financial statements\nincluded herein.\n25\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ (1,198,593) $ (646,492)\nDepreciation and amortization expense 3,426,977 2,315,901\nInterest expense 594,106 367,745\nInterest income (27) (5,496)\nIncome tax benefit (487,861) (119,646)\nEBITDA $ 2,334,602 $ 1,912,012\nSales\nWine case sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and ending inventory amounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, are shown in the\nfollowing table:\nCases Sold Cases Sold Cases On-Hand\nVarietal/Product 2023 2022 December 31, 2023\nPinot Noir/Estate 17,334 16,079 21,554\nPinot Noir/Barrel Select 10,093 19,789 1,185\nPinot Noir/Founders Reserve 3,988 4,519 5,091\nPinot Noir/Special Designates 12,706 14,083 16,028\nPinot Noir/Whole Cluster 60,070 50,674 32,697\nPinot Gris 33,279 33,568 9,109\nRiesling 19,982 19,298 7,879\nChardonnay 5,191 5,010 5,246\nOther 28,976 24,351 32,858\nTotal 191,619 187,371 131,647\nApproximately 54% of the Company’s case sales during 2023 were of the Company’s flagship varietal, Pinot Noir. Case sales of Pinot Gris and Riesling\nfollow with approximately 17% and 10% of case sales, respectively. The Company sold approximately 191,619 and 187,371 cases of Company-produced\nwine during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This represents an increase of approximately 4,248 cases, or 2.3%, 2023 compared\nto 2022. The increase in case sales in 2023 compared to 2022 was the result of an increase in direct-to-consumer case sales.\nThe Company has three primary sales channels: 1) direct-to-consumer sales; 2) in-state sales to distributors; and 3) out-of-state sales to distributors. These\nthree sales channels represent 52.4%, 14.4% and 33.2%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. This compares to 46.4%,\n17.5% and 36.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Miscellaneous and grape sales are included in direct-to-consumer\nsales.\nThe Company’s direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors offer comparable products to customers and utilize similar processes and share\nresources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin than national sales to distributors due to\ndifferentiated pricing between these segments.\n26\nWine Inventory\nThe Company had 131,647 cases of bottled wine on-hand at the end of 2023. Management believes sufficient bulk wine inventory is on-hand to bottle\napproximately 330,000 cases of wine in 2023, and that sufficient stock is on hand to meet current demand levels until the 2023 vintage becomes available.\nProduction Capacity\nCurrent production volumes are within the current production capacity constraints of the Winery, when including storage capacity at the Tualatin Winery\nand utilization of temporary storage when appropriate. In 2023, 234,086 cases were produced. We have the capacity to store and process about 275,000\ncases of wine per year at the Estate Winery but can expand that capacity by utilizing storage at the Tualatin Winery and temporary storage. Management\ncontinues to invest in new production technologies intended to increase the efficiency and quality of wine production. During 2023, the Company did not\nutilize the wine production facilities at the Tualatin Winery but did utilize it for wine storage. The Tualatin Winery has capacity to produce approximately\n28,000 cases of wine. Management intends to fully utilize the production capacity at the Estate Winery before expanding into the Tualatin Winery.\nGrape Supply\nFor the 2023 and 2022 vintages, the Company grew approximately 42% and 66% of all grapes harvested, respectively. The remaining grapes harvested\nwere purchased from other growers. In 2023 and 2022, 18% and 8% of grapes harvested were purchased under short-term contracts, and 40% and 26% of\ngrapes harvested were purchased under long-term contracts, respectively. The Company considers short-term contracts to be for single vintage years and\nlong-term contracts to cover multiple vintage years.\nGrapes are typically harvested and received in September and October of the vintage year. Upon receipt, the grapes are weighed, and a quality analysis is\nperformed to ensure the grapes meet the standards set forth in the purchase contract. Based on the quantity of qualifying grapes received, the full amount\npayable to the grower is recorded to the grapes payable liability account. Approximately 50% of the grapes payable amount is due in November of the\nvintage year. The remaining amount is due in March of the following year. The grapes are processed into wine, which is typically bottled and available for\nsale between five months and two years from the date of harvest.\nThe Company received $3,313,483 and $1,868,742 worth of grapes from long-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The Company received $1,941,572 and $639,677 worth of grapes from short-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. Total grapes payable was $2,446,233 and $1,208,673 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total grapes payable includes\n$1,357,649 and $934,371 of grapes payable from long-term contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company plans to address long-term grape supply needs by developing new vineyards on properties currently owned or secured by lease. The\nCompany has approximately 53 acres of vineyards that have been planted but are in the pre-productive stage. We anticipate that these vineyards will begin\nproducing grapes within the next one to three years. The Company has approximately 213 acres of land that is suitable for future vineyard development.\nThe Company intends to seek out opportunities to acquire land for future grape plantings in order to continue to increase available quantities, maintain\ncontrol over farming practices, more effectively manage grape costs and mitigate uncertainty associated with long-term contracts.\n27\nWine Quality\nContinued awareness of the Willamette Valley Vineyards brand and the quality of its wines was enhanced by national and regional media coverage\nthroughout 2023 including the accolades below.\nJames Suckling rated the Company’s 2021 Estate Pinot Noir 91 points, Dijon Clone Chardonnay 91 points and the 2022 Pinot Gris 90 points.\nWine Enthusiast Magazine rated the Company’s 2021 Estate Pinot Noir 91 points, 2021 Dijon Clone Pinot Noir 90 points and 2021 Founders’ Reserve\nPinot Noir 90 points. The Company’s 2022 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir 90 points, 2022 White Pinot Noir 91 points, 2022 Maison Bleue Voltigeur Viognier\n90 points, 2020 Métis Red Blend 92 points and Cellar Selection.\nSunset International Wine Competition awarded the Company’s 2022 Whole Cluster Rosé of Pinot Noir 94 points with a Gold Medal.\nSip Magazine’s Best of the Northwest rated the Company’s 2022 Pinot Blanc a Double Gold.\nGlobal Fine Wine Challenge awarded the Company’s 2019 Griffin Creek Cabernet Franc and 2019 Domaine Willamette Brut both Gold.\nSeasonality\nThe Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue and net income. Typically, first quarter\nsales are the lowest of any given year, and sales volumes increase progressively through the fourth quarter mostly because of consumer buying habits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital balance of $18.4 million and a current ratio of 2.33:1. The Company had cash balances of\n$238,482, at December 31, 2023.\nTotal cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,998,850, which resulted primarily from a net loss in 2023 as well as\nincreased inventory and lease liabilities. This was partially offset by increased depreciation, a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in grapes\npayable.\nTotal cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4,726,970, which primarily consisted of cash used on construction\nactivity and vineyard development costs.\nTotal cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6,615,626, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the\nissuance of Preferred Stock and an increase in the line of credit and long term debt, being partially offset by the payment of a preferred stock dividend.\nIn December of 2005, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Umpqua Bank (the “Credit Agreement”) that allows borrowing\nup to $2,000,000 against eligible accounts receivable and inventories, as defined in the agreement. The revolving line bears interest at prime less 0.5%,\nwith a floor of 3.25%, is payable monthly, and is subject to renewal.

(the “Company”) owns and operates vineyards, wineries and tasting rooms, and\nproduces and distributes premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines, primarily Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Riesling and Sparkling wine.\nThe Company has direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors. These sales channels offer comparable products to customers and utilize\nsimilar processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin than national\nsales to distributors due to differentiated pricing between these segments.\nBasis of presentation – The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America, which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFinancial instruments and concentrations of risk – The Company has the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, grapes payable, and short and long-term debt.\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained at five financial institutions. Deposits held with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance\nprovided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with a financial institution of reputable credit and\ntherefore bear minimal credit risk.\nIn 2023, sales to one distributor represented approximately 14.5% of total Company revenue. In 2022, sales to one distributor represented approximately\n17.5% of total Company revenue.\nAt December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for approximately 27% of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for\napproximately 27% and 14% of accounts receivable.\nOther comprehensive income – The nature of the Company’s business and related transactions do not give rise to other comprehensive income.\nCash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds.\nAccounts receivable – The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. A reserve is maintained for\npotential credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on an assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews\nthe allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic\nconditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company has credit risk associated with uncollateralized trade accounts receivable from all\noperations totaling $2,994,829 as of December 31, 2023, net of the allowance for credit losses. The Company had credit risk associated with\nuncollateralized trade accounts receivable from all operations totaling $4,226,948 and $3,163,375 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, net of the allowance\nfor credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 2.\nInventories – For Company produced wines, after a portion of the vineyard becomes commercially productive, the annual crop and production costs\nrelating to such portion are recognized as work-in-process inventories. Such costs are accumulated with related direct and indirect harvest costs, wine\nprocessing and production costs, and are transferred to finished goods inventories when the wine is produced, bottled, and ready for sale.\n36\nThe cost of finished goods is recognized as cost of sales when the wine product is sold. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories are stated at the\nlower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value by variety. Winemaking and packaging materials are stated at the lower of average cost or net\nrealizable value. Net realizable value is the value of an asset that can be realized upon the sale of the asset, less a reasonable estimate of the costs associated\nwith either the eventual sale or the disposal of the asset in question.\nIn accordance with general practices in the wine industry, wine inventories are generally included in current assets in the accompanying balance sheets,\nalthough a portion of such inventories may be aged for more than one year (Note 3).\nVineyard development costs – Vineyard development costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to\nprepare the land and construct vine trellises. The costs are capitalized until the vineyard becomes commercially productive, at which time annual\namortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years.\nAccumulated amortization of vineyard development costs aggregated $2,518,585 and $2,354,989 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become a\ncomponent of cost of goods sold. For the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, $163,596 and $284,980, respectively, was capitalized into inventory\ncosts.\nProperty and equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Land\nimprovements are depreciated over 15 to 30 years. Winery buildings are depreciated over 30 years. Equipment is depreciated over 3 to 15 years, depending\non the classification of the asset. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful life. Depreciation is discussed\nfurther in Note 4.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred. Expenditures for additions and betterments are capitalized. When\nassets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is\nincluded in operations.\nReview of long-lived assets for impairment – The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment,\nvineyard development costs, and operating lease right of use assets. Circumstances that might cause the Company to evaluate its long-lived assets for\nimpairment could include a significant decline in the prices the Company or the industry can charge for its products, which could be caused by general\neconomic or other factors, changes in laws or regulations that make it difficult or more costly for the Company to distribute its products to its markets at\nprices which generate adequate returns, natural disasters, significant decrease in demand for the Company’s products or significant increase in the costs to\nmanufacture the Company’s products.\nRecoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be\ngenerated by the asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest\nlevel for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). This would typically be at\nthe winery level. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nIncome taxes – Income taxes are recognized using enacted tax rates and are composed of taxes on financial accounting income that is adjusted for\nrequirements of current tax law, and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are estimated using the asset and liability approach, whereby, deferred income taxes are\ncalculated for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities.\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. The Company recognizes interest assessed by taxing authorities as a\ncomponent of tax expense. The Company recognizes any penalties assessed by taxing authorities as a component of tax expense. Interest and penalties for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n37\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company\nevaluates the potential realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if\nnecessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization included the Company’s forecast of future taxable income or loss and available tax\nplanning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Certain intangible assets and liabilities will be deductible for tax\npurposes and may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities as the benefits are recognized in the Company’s tax returns.\nThe Company files U.S. federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as well as income tax returns in Oregon and California. The\nCompany may be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2020 through 2023. Additionally, the Company may be subject to examinations by state\ntaxing jurisdictions for tax years 2019 through 2023. The Company is not aware of any current examinations by the IRS or the state taxing authorities.\nRevenue recognition – The Company recognizes revenue once its performance obligation to the customer is completed, and control of the product or\nservice is transferred to the customer. Revenue reflects the total amount the Company receives, or expects to receive, from the customer and includes\nshipping costs that are billed and included in the consideration. Excise taxes that are accrued and paid, as a result of a transaction, are accounted for as an\noffset to sales in the net sales calculation. The Company’s contractual obligations to customers generally have a single point of obligation and are short\nterm in nature.\nThe cost of price promotions and rebates are treated as reductions of revenue. Credit sales are recorded as trade accounts receivable, and no collateral is\nrequired. Revenue from items sold through the Company’s retail locations is recognized at the time of sale. Net revenue reported herein is shown net of\nsales allowances and excise taxes. If the conditions for revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers the revenue until all conditions are met. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company has recorded deferred revenue in the amount of $490,523, which is included in unearned revenue on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded deferred revenue in the amount of $335,431 and $255,376, respectively,\nwhich is included in unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Gift cards that have been issued but not used are also treated as unearned revenue and were\n$1,480,138 as of December 31, 2023. Gift cards that have been issued but not used are also treated as unearned revenue and were $1,106,970 and $682,881\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDistributor Sales Segment – Wholesale wine sales are through distributors and the Company recognizes revenue when the product is shipped, and title\npasses to the distributor. The Company’s standard terms are ‘FOB’ shipping point, with no customer acceptance provisions. The cost of price promotions\nand rebates are treated as reductions of revenue. Credit sales are recorded as trade accounts receivable, and no collateral is required.\nThe Company has price incentive programs with its distributors to encourage product placement and depletions. Sales are reported net of incentive program\nexpenses. Incentive program payments are made when completed incentive program payment requests are received from the customers. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded incentive program expenses of $1,057,198 and $1,333,396, respectively, as a reduction in sales on the\nStatements of Operations. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company has recorded an incentive program liability in the amount of $54,003 and\n$111,398, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheets. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each\ntype of program or customer and have historically been in line with actual costs incurred.\nDirect Sales Segment – The Company sells wine directly to customers through its tasting rooms, web site and wine club. Additionally, the Company sells\nmerchandise, food, and hospitality related services through its tasting rooms.\nTasting room sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale and internet sales are recognized at time of shipment. Hospitality sales, that are paid in\nadvance of the event, are accrued as unearned revenue, and are subsequently recognized as revenue in the period of the event. Wine club sales are made\nunder an agreement with the customer, which specifies the quantity and timing of the wine club shipment. Wine club charges are billed to the customer’s\ncredit card, at the time of shipment, and revenue is then recognized.\nThe Company periodically sells bulk wine or grapes that either do not meet the Company’s quality standards or are in excess of production requirements.\nThese sales are recognized when ownership transfers to the buyer which occurs at the point of shipment.\n38\nCost of goods sold – Costs of goods sold include costs associated with grape growing, external grape costs, packaging materials, winemaking and\nproduction costs, vineyard and production administrative support and overhead costs, purchasing and receiving costs and warehousing costs.\nAdministrative support, purchasing, receiving and most other fixed overhead costs are expensed as selling, general and administrative expenses without\nregard to inventory units. Warehouse and winery production and facilities costs are allocated to inventory units on a per gallon basis during the production\nof wine, prior to bottling the final product. No further costs are allocated to inventory units after bottling.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses – Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non-manufacturing administrative and\noverhead costs, advertising, and other marketing promotions. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs incurred were $393,859 and $340,427 respectively.\nThe Company provides an allowance to distributors for providing sample of products to potential customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, these costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses were, $93,272 and $87,996, respectively.\nShipping and handling costs – Amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Costs incurred for\nshipping and handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, shipping and\nhandling costs incurred were $723,787 and $681,975 respectively.\nExcise taxes – The Company pays alcohol excise taxes based on product sales to both the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and to the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Company is liable for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s\nwarehouse on a per gallon basis. The federal tax rate is affected by a small winery tax credit provision, which declines based upon the number of gallons of\nwine production in a year rather than the quantity sold. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton basis to the Oregon Liquor Control\nCommission for the Oregon Wine Advisory. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, excise taxes incurred were $431,714 and $312,103\nrespectively.\nLoss per common share after preferred dividends – loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\neach year.\nLeases – We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. On our balance sheets, our operating leases are included in Operating lease right of use\n(“ROU”) assets, Current portion of lease liabilities and Lease liabilities, net of current portion. The Company does not currently have any finance leases.\nLeases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement date are considered short-term in nature. Accordingly, short-term leases are not\nincluded on the balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date we have the right to control the\nproperty.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. For leases that do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date\nin determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on\na straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSignificant judgment may be required when determining whether a contract contains a lease, the length of the lease term, the allocation of the consideration\nin a contract between lease and non-lease components, and the determination of the discount rate included in our leases. We review the underlying\nobjective of each contract, the terms of the contract, and consider our current and future business conditions when making these judgments.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\nand in May 2019 issued ASU 2019-05, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief (collectively referred to as “Topic 326”).

The Company measures expected credit losses of financial assets based on historical loss and other information available to\nmanagement. These expected credit losses are recorded to an allowance for credit losses valuation account that is deducted from accounts receivable to\npresent the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, no change to allowance for credit\nlosses was deemed necessary.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses.

Direct Sales include retail sales in the tasting rooms, wine club sales, internet sales, on-site events, kitchen and catering sales and other\nsales made directly to the consumer without the use of an intermediary, including sales of bulk wine or grapes. Distributor Sales include all sales through a\nthird party where prices are given at a wholesale rate.\n47\nThe two segments reflect how the Company’s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. The\nCompany evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the\nsegment, including depreciation of segment specific assets, are included, however, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are\nnot allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income (loss) information for the respective segments is not available. Discrete financial\ninformation related to segment assets, other than segment specific depreciation associated with selling, is not available and that information continues to be\naggregated.\nThe following table outlines the sales, cost of sales, gross margin, directly attributable selling expenses, and contribution margin of the segments for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (b)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s\nmanagement and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of\nthe Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have\ninherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement\npreparation and presentation.\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial\nreporting was effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under\nthe Exchange Act) during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

Purpose and Scope\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance\ncompensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”), which provides for the recovery of erroneously awarded\nCompensation in the event of a Triggering Event (as defined below). Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms have the meanings set forth\nunder “XIII. Definitions.”\nII. Administration\nThis Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act,\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5608 and other regulations, rules and guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) thereunder, and related\nsecurities regulations and regulations of the stock exchange or association on which Company’s common shares are listed (collectively, the “Listing\nStandards”). This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”).\nAny determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding. In addition, the Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in\naccordance with the Listing Standards. The Committee hereby has the power and authority to enforce the terms and conditions of this Policy and to use any\nand all of the Company’s resources it deems appropriate to recoup any excess Compensation subject to this Policy.\nIII. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former Covered Executives, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Listing Standards.\nIV. Events That Trigger Recoupment Under This Policy\nThe Board or Committee will be required to recoup any excess Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three (3) completed fiscal\nyears (together with any interim stub fiscal year period(s) of less than nine (9) months resulting from the Company’s transition to different fiscal year\nmeasurement dates) immediately preceding the date the Company is deemed (as determined pursuant to the immediately following sentence) to be required\nto prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement (the “Three-Year Recovery Period”) irrespective of any fault, misconduct or responsibility of such Covered\nExecutive for the Covered Accounting Restatement. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company is deemed to be required to prepare\na Covered Accounting Restatement on the earlier of (A) the date upon which the Board or applicable committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of\nthe Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required\nto prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement; or (B) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Covered\nAccounting Restatement (each a “Triggering Event”).\n-1-\nV. Excess Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount of Compensation to be recovered shall be the excess of the Compensation received by the Covered Executive over the amount of\nCompensation which would have been received by the Covered Executive had the amount of such Compensation been calculated based on the restated\namounts, as determined by the Committee. For purposes of this Policy, Compensation shall be deemed “received”, either wholly or in part, in the fiscal\nyear during which any applicable Financial Reporting Measure is attained, even if the payment, vesting or grant of such Compensation occurs after the end\nof such fiscal year. Amounts required to be recouped under this Policy shall be calculated on a pre-tax basis. The date of receipt of the Compensation\ndepends upon the terms of the award of such Compensation. For example:\na. If the grant of an award of Compensation is based, either wholly or in part, on the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure\nperformance goal, then the award would be deemed received in the fiscal period when that measure was satisfied;\nb. If the vesting of an equity award of Compensation occurs only upon the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance\ncondition, then the award would be deemed received in the fiscal period when it vests;\nc. If the earning of a non-equity incentive plan award of Compensation is based on the satisfaction of the relevant Financial Reporting\nMeasure performance goal, then the non-equity incentive plan award will be deemed received in the fiscal year in which that\nperformance goal is satisfied; and\nd. If the earning of a cash award of Compensation is based on the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal, then the\ncash award will be deemed received in the fiscal period when that measure is satisfied.\nIt is specifically understood that, to the extent that the impact of the Covered Accounting Restatement on the amount of Compensation received cannot be\ncalculated directly from the information in the Covered Accounting Restatement (e.g., if such restatement’s impact on the Company’s share price is not\nclear), then such excess amount of Compensation shall be determined based on the Committee’s reasonable estimate of the effect of the Covered\nAccounting Restatement on the share price or total shareholder return upon which the Compensation was received. The Company shall maintain\ndocumentation for the determination of such excess amount and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).\nVI. Method of Recovery\nThe Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the methods for recovering excess Compensation hereunder, which methods may include, without\nlimitation:\ne. requiring reimbursement of cash Compensation previously paid;\nf. seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\ng. offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\nh. cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\ni. taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Section VI, and subject to applicable law, the Committee may cause recoupment under this Policy from any amount of\nCompensation approved, awarded, granted, paid, or payable to any Covered Executive prior to, on, or following the Effective Date (as defined below).\nVII. Impracticability\nThe Committee shall recover any excess Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the\nCommittee in accordance with the Listing Standards. It is specifically understood that recovery shall only be deemed impractical if (A) the direct expense\npaid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover\nany amount of erroneously awarded Compensation based on the expense of enforcement, the Committee shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such\nerroneously awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq); (B) recovery would\nviolate home country law where that law was adopted prior to the November 28, 2022 (before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any\namount of erroneously awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Committee shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel,\nacceptable to the applicable national securities exchange or association on which Company’s common shares are trading, that recovery would result in such\na violation, and must provide such opinion to the exchange or association); or (C) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a), and\nthe regulations promulgated thereunder.\n-2-\nVIII. Other Recoupment Rights; Acknowledgement\nThe Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date\nshall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of\nrecoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company\npursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies\navailable to the Company. The Company shall provide notice and seek written acknowledgement of this Policy from each Covered Executive; provided,\nthat the failure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this Policy to, or\nagainst, any Covered Executive.\nIX. No Indemnification of Covered Executives\nNotwithstanding any right to indemnification under any plan, policy or agreement of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall not indemnify\nany Covered Executives against the loss of any excess Compensation. In addition, the Company shall be prohibited from paying or reimbursing a Covered\nExecutive for premiums of any third-party insurance purchased to fund any potential recovery obligations.\nX. Indemnification\nTo the extent allowable pursuant to applicable law, each member of the Board or the Committee and any officer or other employee to whom authority to\nadminister any component of this Policy is designated shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that\nmay be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she\nmay be a party or in which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to this Policy\nand against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided,\nhowever, that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and\ndefend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such\nindividuals may be entitled pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the\nCompany may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.\nXI. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date the Policy is adopted by the Board (the “Board Adoption Date”). This Policy shall apply to any Compensation\nthat is received by Covered Executives on or after the October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), even if such Compensation was approved, awarded, granted,\nor paid to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date or the Board Adoption Date.\nXII. Amendment and Termination; Interpretation\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect and comply with\nfurther regulations, rules and guidance of the SEC and Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration\nof this Policy. This Policy is designed and intended to be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Listing Standards. To the\nextent there is any inconsistency between this Policy and such regulations, rules and guidance, such regulations, rules and guidance shall control, and this\nPolicy shall be deemed amended to incorporate such regulations, rules and guidance until or unless the Board or the Committee expressly determine\notherwise.\n-3-\nThis Policy shall be applicable, binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other\nlegal representatives to the fullest extent of the law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy shall be in addition to (and not in substitution of) any other\nclawback policy of the Company in effect from time to time or applicable to any Covered Executive.\nXIII. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n1. “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n2. “Company” means Silo Pharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries and their successors.\n3. “Compensation” means any compensation which was approved, awarded or granted to, or earned by a Covered Executive (A) while the\nCompany had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (B) following on or after the\nEffective Date (including any award under any short-term or long-term incentive compensation plan of the Company, including any other short-\nterm or long-term cash or equity incentive award or any other payment) that, in each case, is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part\nupon the attainment of any Financial Reporting Measure (i.e., any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measures, including\nshare price and total shareholder return). Compensation may include (but is not limited to) any of the following:\na. Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives;\nb. Stock options;\nc. Stock appreciation rights;\nd. Restricted shares;\ne. Restricted share units;\nf. Performance shares; and\ng. Performance units.\n4. “Covered Accounting Restatement” means any accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws. A Covered Accounting Restatement includes any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements\n(commonly referred to as “Big R” restatements) or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or\nleft uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as “little r” restatements).
