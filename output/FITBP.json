All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our financial condition,\nresults of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, capital actions or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as “will likely result,” “may,” “are expected to,” “is anticipated,”\n“potential,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “projected,” “intends to,” or may include other similar words or phrases such as “believes,” “plans,” “trend,” “objective,” “continue,” “remain,” or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs\nsuch as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth\nin our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not\nlimited to: (1) deteriorating credit quality; (2) loan concentration by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; (3) problems encountered by other financial institutions; (4) inadequate sources of funding or liquidity; (5)\nunfavorable actions of rating agencies; (6) inability to maintain or grow deposits; (7) limitations on the ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries; (8) cyber-security risks; (9) Fifth Third’s ability to secure confidential\ninformation and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; (10) failures by third-party service providers; (11) inability to manage strategic initiatives and/or\norganizational changes; (12) inability to implement technology system enhancements; (13) failure of internal controls and other risk management programs; (14) losses related to fraud, theft, misappropriation or violence; (15)\ninability to attract and retain skilled personnel; (16) adverse impacts of government regulation; (17) governmental or regulatory changes or other actions; (18) failures to meet applicable capital requirements; (19) regulatory\nobjections to Fifth Third’s capital plan; (20) regulation of Fifth Third’s derivatives activities; (21) deposit insurance premiums; (22) assessments for the orderly liquidation fund; (23) weakness in the national or local economies;\n(24) global political and economic uncertainty or negative actions; (25) changes in interest rates and the effects of inflation; (26) changes and trends in capital markets; (27) fluctuation of Fifth Third’s stock price; (28) volatility in\nmortgage banking revenue; (29) litigation, investigations, and enforcement proceedings by governmental authorities; (30) breaches of contractual covenants, representations and warranties; (31) competition and changes in the\nfinancial services industry; (32) potential impacts of the adoption of real-time payment networks; (33) changing retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior; (34) difficulties in identifying, acquiring or\nintegrating suitable strategic partnerships, investments or acquisitions; (35) potential dilution from future acquisitions; (36) loss of income and/or difficulties encountered in the sale and separation of businesses, investments or\nother assets; (37) results of investments or acquired entities; (38) changes in accounting standards or interpretation or declines in the value of Fifth Third’s goodwill or other intangible assets; (39) inaccuracies or other failures\nfrom the use of models; (40) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments or the use of inaccurate estimates; (41) weather-related events, other natural disasters, or health emergencies (including pandemics); (42) the\nimpact of reputational risk created by these or other developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; (43) changes in law or requirements imposed by Fifth Third’s regulators impacting\nour capital actions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (44) Fifth Third's ability to meet its environmental and/or social targets, goals and commitments.\nYou should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or “SEC,” for further information on other factors, which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those\nexpressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us. We expressly\ndisclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or\ncircumstances on which any such statement is based, except as may be required by law, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. The information contained herein is intended to be reviewed in its totality, and any stipulations, conditions or provisos that apply to a given piece of information in one part of this press release should be read as applying\nmutatis mutandis to every other instance of such information appearing herein. Copies of those filings are available at no cost on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.53.com.\nAnnualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nIn this presentation, we may sometimes provide non-GAAP financial information. Please note that although non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight to analysts, investors and regulators, they should not be considered\nin isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures. We provide a discussion of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on pages 27 through 29 of our\n3Q24 earnings release.\nManagement does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not\navailable without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Bancorp's control or cannot be\nreasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Bancorp's management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nThis presentation incorporates the following peers: CFG, CMA, FCNCA, FHN, HBAN, KEY, MTB, PNC, RF, TFC, USB, & ZION.\n2\n© Fifth Third Bancorp | All Rights Reserved\nDisciplined execution guided by core principles\n#1 Stability #2 Profitability #3 Growth\n• Defensive balance sheet • Diverse fee mix with high • Southeast demographics\npositioning total revenue contribution\n• Midwest & renewables\n• Strong credit profile • Expense discipline infrastructure investments\n• Drive NIM expansion • Tech-enabled product\ninnovation\nConsistent and disciplined management, with a\nlong-term focus throughout the company\n3\n© Fifth Third Bancorp | All Rights Reserved\nTop performing regional bank with local scale and national\nreach\nAssets\nLeading position in the markets we compete in3\n$214 billion\nToronto office\nDeposit share rankings4\nRanked 11th in the U.S.1\n#3\nFifth Third footprint\nunchanged YoY\nDeposits\n#2 Midwest #6 Southeast\n$168 billion\nunchanged YoY unchanged YoY\nRanked 9th in the U.S.1\nTop 10 deposit share in ~96% of retail footprint\nU.S. branches\n1,072\nSignificant locational share in notable MSAs\nRanked 8th in the U.S.1\nChicago, IL #3 Tampa, FL #6\nFifth Third Corporate Headquarters London office Nashville, TN #3 Grand Rapids, MI #1\nCommercial Cincinnati, Ohio\nCharlotte, NC #4 Columbus, OH #3\nPayments\nTop 5 market share\nMidwest footprint Key Southeast MSAs of focus Cincinnati, OH #1 Indianapolis, IN #3\nacross several\nproduct categories5 Southeast footprint Major FITB markets2 with a top 5\ndeposit share\nAssets, deposits, and branches as of 9/30/24;

Excluding the $5 million reduction related to the customer\nremediations in the prior quarter, NII was up $29 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting higher loan yields, the benefit of higher\nday count, and lower wholesale funding costs, partially offset by lower average commercial loan balances. Compared to\nthe prior quarter, NIM increased 2 bps. Excluding the aforementioned customer remediations in the prior quarter, NIM\nincreased 1 bp, primarily reflecting higher loan yields from the repricing benefit on the fixed rate loan portfolio, partially\noffset by the impact of higher cash balances.

income (FTE),” “interest income (FTE),” “net interest margin (FTE),” “net interest rate spread (FTE),” “income before income taxes (FTE),”\n“tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “tangible\ncommon equity (excluding AOCI),” “tangible common equity (including AOCI),” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per share,” “tangible book value per\nshare (excluding AOCI),” “adjusted noninterest income,” “noninterest income excluding certain items,” “adjusted noninterest expense,” “noninterest\nexpense excluding certain items,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted efficiency ratio,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return\non average tangible common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income\",\n“adjusted pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “efficiency ratio (FTE),” “total revenue (FTE),” “noninterest income as a\npercent of total revenue”, and certain ratios derived from these measures. The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information\nto investors because these are among the measures used by the Fifth Third management team to evaluate operating performance and to make day-to-\nday operating decisions.\nThe FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income\ntax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and net interest margin as it\nprovides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.\nThe Bancorp believes tangible net income available to common shareholders, average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (excluding\nAOCI), tangible common equity (including AOCI), tangible equity, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are\nimportant measures for evaluating the performance of the business without the impacts of intangible items, whether acquired or created internally, in a\nmanner comparable to other companies in the industry who present similar measures.\nThe Bancorp believes noninterest income, noninterest expense, net interest income, net interest margin, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio,\nnoninterest income as a percent of total revenue, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average\nassets are important measures that adjust for significant, unusual, or large transactions that may occur in a reporting period which management does\nnot consider indicative of ongoing financial performance and enhances comparability of results with prior periods.\nThe Bancorp believes noninterest income excluding certain items and noninterest expense excluding certain items are important measures that adjust\nfor certain components that are prone to significant period-to-period changes in order to facilitate the explanation of variances in the noninterest income\nand noninterest expense line items.\nManagement considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity\n(including and excluding AOCI), in addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital\nratios defined by U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in\nthe federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible\ncommon equity ratio excluding AOCI on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the\neffects of changes in AOCI, some of which are uncertain; providing the tangible common equity ratio including AOCI enables investors and others to\nassess the Bancorp’s use of equity if components of AOCI, such as unrealized gains or losses, were to be monetized.\nPlease note that although non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute\nfor analysis using GAAP measures.\nPlease see reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the\nfollowing page.\n27\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\n$ and shares in millions As of and For the Three Months Ended\n(unaudited) September June March December September\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nNet interest income $1,421 $1,387 $1,384 $1,416 $1,438\nAdd: Taxable equivalent adjustment 6 6 6 7 7\nNet interest income (FTE) (a) 1,427 1,393 1,390 1,423 1,445\nNet interest income (annualized) (b) 5,653 5,578 5,566 5,618 5,705\nNet interest income (FTE) (annualized) (c) 5,677 5,603 5,591 5,646 5,733\nInteres t income 2,669 2,620 2,608 2,648 2,529\nAdd: Taxable equivalent adjustment 6 6 6 7 7\nInterest income (FTE) 2,675 2,626 2,614 2,655 2,536\nInterest income (FTE) (annualized) (d) 10,642 10,562 10,513 10,533 10,061\nInterest expense (annualized) (e) 4,965 4,959 4,923 4,888 4,328\nAverage interest-earning assets (f) 195,836 194,499 195,349 198,166 192,216\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities (g) 147,092 146,361 146,533 146,507 139,779\nNet interest margin (b) / (f) 2.89 % 2.87 % 2.85 % 2.83 % 2.97 %\nNet interest margin (FTE) (c) / (f) 2.90 % 2.88 % 2.86 % 2.85 % 2.98 %\nNet interest rate spread (FTE) (d) / (f) -

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our financial condition,\nresults of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, capital actions or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as “will likely result,” “may,” “are expected to,” “is anticipated,”\n“potential,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “projected,” “intends to,” or may include other similar words or phrases such as “believes,” “plans,” “trend,” “objective,” “continue,” “remain,” or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs\nsuch as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth\nin our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not\nlimited to: (1) deteriorating credit quality; (2) loan concentration by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; (3) problems encountered by other financial institutions; (4) inadequate sources of funding or liquidity; (5)\nunfavorable actions of rating agencies; (6) inability to maintain or grow deposits; (7) limitations on the ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries; (8) cyber-security risks; (9) Fifth Third’s ability to secure confidential\ninformation and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; (10) failures by third-party service providers; (11) inability to manage strategic initiatives and/or\norganizational changes; (12) inability to implement technology system enhancements; (13) failure of internal controls and other risk management programs; (14) losses related to fraud, theft, misappropriation or violence; (15)\ninability to attract and retain skilled personnel; (16) adverse impacts of government regulation; (17) governmental or regulatory changes or other actions; (18) failures to meet applicable capital requirements; (19) regulatory\nobjections to Fifth Third’s capital plan; (20) regulation of Fifth Third’s derivatives activities; (21) deposit insurance premiums; (22) assessments for the orderly liquidation fund; (23) weakness in the national or local economies; (24)\nglobal political and economic uncertainty or negative actions; (25) changes in interest rates and the effects of inflation; (26) changes and trends in capital markets; (27) fluctuation of Fifth Third’s stock price; (28) volatility in\nmortgage banking revenue; (29) litigation, investigations, and enforcement proceedings by governmental authorities; (30) breaches of contractual covenants, representations and warranties; (31) competition and changes in the\nfinancial services industry; (32) potential impacts of the adoption of real-time payment networks; (33) changing retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior; (34) difficulties in identifying, acquiring or\nintegrating suitable strategic partnerships, investments or acquisitions; (35) potential dilution from future acquisitions; (36) loss of income and/or difficulties encountered in the sale and separation of businesses, investments or\nother assets; (37) results of investments or acquired entities; (38) changes in accounting standards or interpretation or declines in the value of Fifth Third’s goodwill or other intangible assets; (39) inaccuracies or other failures\nfrom the use of models; (40) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments or the use of inaccurate estimates; (41) weather-related events, other natural disasters, or health emergencies (including pandemics); (42) the\nimpact of reputational risk created by these or other developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; (43) changes in law or requirements imposed by Fifth Third’s regulators impacting\nour capital actions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (44) Fifth Third's ability to meet its environmental and/or social targets, goals and commitments.\nYou should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or “SEC,” for further information on other factors, which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those\nexpressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us. We expressly\ndisclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or\ncircumstances on which any such statement is based, except as may be required by law, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. The information contained herein is intended to be reviewed in its totality, and any stipulations, conditions or provisos that apply to a given piece of information in one part of this press release should be read as applying\nmutatis mutandis to every other instance of such information appearing herein. Copies of those filings are available at no cost on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.53.com.\nAnnualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nIn this presentation, we may sometimes provide non-GAAP financial information. Please note that although non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight to analysts, investors and regulators, they should not be considered in\nisolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures. We provide a discussion of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in later slides in this presentation, as\nwell as on pages 27 through 29 of our 3Q24 earnings release.\nManagement does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not\navailable without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Bancorp's control or cannot be\nreasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Bancorp's management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n2\n© Fifth Third Bancorp | All Rights Reserved\n3Q24 highlights\nReported1 Adjusted1\n• Strong profitability resulted in CET1 increasing to 10.75% while\nEPS $0.78 $0.85\nexecuting $200 million of share repurchases and raising common\ndividend by 6% ROA 1.06% 1.16%\n• Strong fee performance driven by strategic investments ROE 11.7% 12.8%\n• Interest-bearing liabilities costs down 1 bp compared to prior\nROTCE 16.3% 17.9%\nquarter\nNIM 2.90% 2.90%\n• Disciplined expense management;

There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these\nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) deteriorating credit quality; (2) loan concentration by location or industry of borrowers\nor collateral; (3) problems encountered by other financial institutions; (4) inadequate sources of funding or liquidity; (5) unfavorable actions of rating agencies; (6) inability to maintain or grow\ndeposits; (7) limitations on the ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries; (8) cyber-security risks; (9) Fifth Third’s ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and\nservices through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; (10) failures by third-party service providers; (11) inability to manage strategic initiatives and/or organizational\nchanges; (12) inability to implement technology system enhancements; (13) failure of internal controls and other risk management programs; (14) losses related to fraud, theft, misappropriation\nor violence; (15) inability to attract and retain skilled personnel; (16) adverse impacts of government regulation; (17) governmental or regulatory changes or other actions; (18) failures to meet\napplicable capital requirements; (19) regulatory objections to Fifth Third’s capital plan; (20) regulation of Fifth Third’s derivatives activities; (21) deposit insurance premiums; (22) assessments\nfor the orderly liquidation fund; (23) weakness in the national or local economies; (24) global political and economic uncertainty or negative actions; (25) changes in interest rates and the\neffects of inflation; (26) changes and trends in capital markets; (27) fluctuation of Fifth Third’s stock price; (28) volatility in mortgage banking revenue; (29) litigation, investigations, and\nenforcement proceedings by governmental authorities; (30) breaches of contractual covenants, representations and warranties; (31) competition and changes in the financial services industry;\n(32) potential impacts of the adoption of real-time payment networks; (33) changing retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior; (34) difficulties in identifying, acquiring or\nintegrating suitable strategic partnerships, investments or acquisitions; (35) potential dilution from future acquisitions; (36) loss of income and/or difficulties encountered in the sale and\nseparation of businesses, investments or other assets; (37) results of investments or acquired entities; (38) changes in accounting standards or interpretation or declines in the value of Fifth\nThird’s goodwill or other intangible assets; (39) inaccuracies or other failures from the use of models; (40) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments or the use of inaccurate\nestimates; (41) weather-related events, other natural disasters, or health emergencies (including pandemics); (42) the impact of reputational risk created by these or other developments on such\nmatters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; (43) changes in law or requirements imposed by Fifth Third’s regulators impacting our capital actions, including dividend\npayments and stock repurchases; and (44) Fifth Third’s ability to meet its environmental and/or social targets, goals and commitments.

Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding\ncompany and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank.\nOVERVIEW\nFifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp had\n$214 billion in assets and operated 1,072 full-service banking centers and 2,060 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the\nMidwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and\nSmall Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management.\nThis overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information\nthat is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and\ncritical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp’s financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool\nfor the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as\nwell as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE\nbasis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for\nfederal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it\nprovides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP\nmeasure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.\nThe Bancorp’s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 67% and 33% of total revenue, respectively. The\nBancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and\nexternal customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that\ndrive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement,\nmonitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the\nBancorp.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense\nincurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of\ninterest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition\nof interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its\nliabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through\npotential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting\nthe composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their\nsensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative\ntransactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on\nits loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate\ncollateral.\nNoninterest income is derived from wealth and asset management revenue, service charges on deposits, commercial banking revenue, card\nand processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses.\nNoninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense,\nmarketing expense, leasing business expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense.\nFDIC Special Assessment\nIn response to the bank closures that occurred in the first half of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment\non banking organizations with greater than $5 billion in assets to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting\nuninsured depositors. The Bancorp’s initial estimate of its allocated share of the special assessment under the provisions of the final rule was\n$224 million, which was recognized in earnings upon issuance of the final rule in November 2023.\nSubsequently, in 2024, the FDIC has announced that it expects to incur additional losses related to these bank closures beyond its initial\nestimates, resulting in an increase to the amount of the special assessment allocated to each member bank. As of September 30, 2024, the\n3\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nBancorp’s estimate of its allocation of the special assessment was $263 million, based on the most recent information provided by the FDIC.\nAs a result, the Bancorp recorded an incremental expense of $39 million during the first six months of 2024. The Bancorp currently expects\nto pay the special assessment to the FDIC over a total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began with the first quarter of 2024. The\nestimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss\namount is determined by the FDIC.\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Transactions\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions\ntotaling $200 million and $325 million, respectively. Refer to Note 17 and Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on share repurchase activity.\nSenior Notes Offerings\nOn January 29, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.0 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on January 29, 2032.\nThe senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.631% per annum until January 28, 2031. From January 29, 2031 until maturity, the senior\nnotes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.840%.\nOn September 6, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $750 million of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on September 6,\n2030. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.895% per annum until September 5, 2029. From September 6, 2029 until maturity, the\nsenior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.486%.\nRefer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nTransfer of Securities\nIn January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to\nreflect the Bancorp’s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with\ninvestment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance\nSheet Analysis section of MD&A for more information.\nCFPB Settlements\nOn July 9, 2024, the Bank and the CFPB agreed to resolve previously outstanding litigation which alleged violations of the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Act, the Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act. The Bank agreed to the entry of a Stipulated Final Judgment\nand Order, pursuant to which the Bank, without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the suit except as specified in the order, agreed\nto pay a civil monetary penalty of $15 million, agreed to maintain existing policies around its consumer sales incentives, agreed to create a\ncompliance plan to ensure its account opening practices comply with law and the order and agreed to provide a redress plan to remediate\ncertain customers with checking, savings, or credit card accounts opened beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2016.\nConcurrently, the Bank also agreed to entry of a Consent Order related to a since-discontinued program in its auto lending business that\nplaced collateral protection insurance on certain automobile loans. Under this Consent Order, without admitting or denying any of the\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), the Bank agreed to pay a $5 million civil monetary penalty related to\nthose issues, maintain existing policy changes related to its auto servicing practices, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its\ncompliance with the order and provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers within a redress period beginning July 21, 2011 and\nending December 31, 2020.\nRefer to Note 19 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these settlements.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring\nthe performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other\nfinancial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key\nperformance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions.\nThese indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change.\nThe following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp’s business performance, including those which are\nconsidered in the Bancorp’s compensation programs:\n• CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-\nweighting of assets\n• Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by\naverage tangible common equity\n4\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n• Return on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total\nequity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock\n• Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets\n• Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest\nincome\n• Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the\neffect of dilutive stock-based awards\n• Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO\n• Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases\n• Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets\n• Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits\n• Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts\nThe list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp’s\nperformance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to\nmanagement or investors.\nTABLE 1: Earnings Summary\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, % September 30, %\n($ in millions, except for per share data) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nIncome Statement Data\nNet interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 1,421 1,438 (1) $ 4,192 4,411 (5)\nNet interest income (FTE)(a)(b) 1,427 1,445 (1) 4,210 4,429 (5)\nNoninterest income 711 715 (1) 2,117 2,137 (1)\nTotal revenue (FTE)(a)(b) 2,138 2,160 (1) 6,327 6,566 (4)\nProvision for credit losses 160 119 34 351 460 (24)\nNoninterest expense 1,244 1,188 5 3,807 3,750 2\nNet income 573 660 (13) 1,694 1,819 (7)\nNet income available to common shareholders 532 623 (15) 1,573 1,719 (8)\nCommon Share Data\nEarnings per share - basic $ 0.78 0.91 (14) $ 2.30 2.51 (8)\nEarnings per share - diluted 0.78 0.91 (14) 2.28 2.50 (9)\nCash dividends declared per common share 0.37 0.35 6 1.07 1.01 6\nBook value per share 27.60 21.19 30 27.60 21.19 30\nMarket value per share 42.84 25.33 69 42.84 25.33 69\nFinancial Ratios\nReturn on average assets 1.06 % 1.26 (16) 1.06 % 1.18 (10)\nReturn on average common equity 11.7 16.3 (28) 12.3 14.6 (16)\nReturn on average tangible common equity(b) 16.3 24.7 (34) 17.6 21.8 (19)\nDividend payout 47.4 38.5 23 46.5 40.2 16\n(a) Amounts presented on an FTE basis.

The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2023\nwas $623 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, which was net of $37 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available\nto common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.6 billion, or $2.28 per diluted share, which was net of $121\nmillion in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was $1.7 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, which was net of $100 million in preferred stock dividends.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.4 billion and $4.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, decreasing $18 million and $219 million compared to the same periods in the prior year. For both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and\ndeposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as decreases in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans.\nThese negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the average balances of other short-term investments and increases in yields on\n5\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\naverage interest-earning assets. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90% and 2.88% for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.98% and 3.12% for the comparable periods in the prior year.\nThe provision for credit losses was $160 million and $351 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to $119 million and $460 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from June 30, 2024, primarily including the recognition of\nspecific reserves on individually evaluated commercial and industrial loans, slight deterioration in the economic forecast and changes in loan\nmix. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused a decrease in the ACL\nfrom December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecast used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease\nbalances. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.48% and 0.41% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.45% and 0.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.62%\nand 0.59%, respectively. For more information on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management\nsection of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNoninterest income decreased $4 million and $20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, leasing business revenue and mortgage banking net\nrevenue, partially offset by increases in wealth and asset management revenue, services charges on deposits and net securities gains.\nNoninterest expense increased $56 million and $57 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense and\ntechnology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in leasing business expense and marketing expense.\nFor more information on net interest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements\nof Income Analysis section of MD&A.\nCapital Summary\nThe Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the\nfive-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30,\n2024, the Bancorp’s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were:\n• CET1 capital ratio: 10.75%;\n• Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 12.07%;\n• Total risk-based capital ratio: 14.13%;\n• Leverage ratio: 9.11%.\n6\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for\nthe primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their\nentirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not\ntaxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest\nincome as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis,\nnet interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:\nTABLE 2: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Financial Measures and Ratios on an FTE basis\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 1,421 1,438 4,192 4,411\nAdd: FTE adjustment 6 7 18 18\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (1) $ 1,427 1,445 4,210 4,429\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (2) 5,677 5,733 5,624 5,922\nInterest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 2,669 2,529 7,897 7,113\nAdd: FTE adjustment 6 7 18 18\nInterest income on an FTE basis $ 2,675 2,536 7,915 7,131\nInterest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (3) 10,642 10,061 10,573 9,534\nInterest expense (annualized) (4) $ 4,965 4,328 4,949 3,613\nNoninterest income (5) 711 715 2,117 2,137\nNoninterest expense (6) 1,244 1,188 3,807 3,750\nAverage interest-earning assets (7) 195,836 192,216 195,231 189,578\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities (8) 147,092 139,779 146,664 134,588\nRatios:\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (2) / (7) 2.90 % 2.98 2.88 3.12\nNet interest rate spread on an FTE basis ((3) / (7)) - ((4) / (8)) 2.05 2.13 2.05 2.35\nEfficiency ratio on an FTE basis (6) / ((1) + (5)) 58.2 55.0 60.2 57.1\nThe Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial\ninstitutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.

These calculations are intended to complement the\ncapital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio\nmeasures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined\nby U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:\nTABLE 4: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Capital Ratios\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nAs of ($ in millions) 2024 2023\nTotal Bancorp Shareholders’ Equity (U.S. GAAP) $ 20,784 19,172\nLess: Preferred stock 2,116 2,116\nGoodwill 4,918 4,919\nIntangible assets 98 125\nAOCI (3,446) (4,487)\nTangible common equity, excluding AOCI (1) $ 17,098 16,499\nAdd: Preferred stock 2,116 2,116\nTangible equity (2) $ 19,214 18,615\nTotal Assets (U.S. GAAP) $ 214,318 214,574\nLess: Goodwill 4,918 4,919\nIntangible assets 98 125\nAOCI, before tax (4,362) (5,680)\nTangible assets, excluding AOCI (3) $ 213,664 215,210\nRatios:\nTangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets (2) / (3) 8.99 % 8.65\nTangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets (1) / (3) 8.00 7.67\n8\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nNote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards\napplicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of a significant accounting standard issued, but not yet required to be adopted.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Bancorp’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies\nrequire management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the\nBancorp’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp’s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the\nALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These\naccounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less\nthe interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, federal funds purchased, other short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net\ninterest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing\nliabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded\nby noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders’ equity.\nTables 5 and 6 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on\nnet interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances.\nAverage outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.4 billion and $4.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, decreasing $18 million and $219 million compared to the same periods in the prior year. For both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and\ndeposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as decreases in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans.\nThese negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the average balances of other short-term investments and increases in yields on\naverage interest-earning assets.\nNet interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.05% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n2.13% and 2.35% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities\nincreased 28 bps and 69 bps, partially offset by increases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 20 bps and 39 bps for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90% and 2.88% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to 2.98% and 3.12% for the comparable periods in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the previously mentioned impacts of higher market interest rates, migration of average\nbalances of deposits from demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits and decreases in average balances of loans and leases. Net interest\nmargin results are expected to modestly increase over the next several quarters driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and moderating deposit\ncosts. However, net interest margin may be negatively impacted by increased deposit competition or higher levels of cash and other short-\nterm investments.\nInterest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $11 million and $195 million during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by increases in\nyields on loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in average balances of commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the\nBancorp’s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest\nincome on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $128 million and $589 million\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to increases in the average balances of other short-term investments. The increase for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 was also driven by an increase in yields on average taxable securities.\nInterest expense on average core deposits increased $153 million and $905 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-\nbearing core deposits to 297 bps and 295 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 265 bps and 219\n9\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nbps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and greater\ncompetition for deposits. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also driven by increases in the average\nbalances of interest-bearing core deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional\ninformation on the Bancorp’s deposits.\nInterest expense on average wholesale funding increased $4 million and $98 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the average balances of long-\nterm debt. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of CDs over\n$250,000. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by an increase in the rates paid on average long-term\ndebt, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB advances.

The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed\nappropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL.\nThe amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net\ncharge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses was $160 million and $351 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to $119 million and $460 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from June 30, 2024, primarily including the recognition of\nspecific reserves on individually evaluated commercial and industrial loans, slight deterioration in the economic forecast and changes in loan\nmix. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused a decrease in the ACL\nfrom December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecast used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease\nbalances.\nThe ALLL decreased $17 million from December 31, 2023 to $2.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans\nand leases was 1.98% at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments decreased $28 million\nfrom December 31, 2023 to $138 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases\ndecreased to 2.09%, compared to 2.12% at December 31, 2023.\nRefer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio\ncomposition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and\nlease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income decreased $4 million and $20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income:\nTABLE 7: Components of Noninterest Income\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nWealth and asset management revenue $ 163 145 12 $ 483 434 11\nService charges on deposits 161 149 8 467 431 8\nCommercial banking revenue 163 154 6 451 461 (2)\nCard and processing revenue 106 104 2 316 310 2\nMortgage banking net revenue 50 57 (12) 154 184 (16)\nLeasing business revenue 43 58 (26) 120 162 (26)\nOther noninterest income 15 55 (73) 103 152 (32)\nSecurities gains (losses), net 10 (7) NM 23 3 667\nTotal noninterest income $ 711 715 (1) $ 2,117 2,137 (1)\nWealth and asset management revenue\nWealth and asset management revenue increased $18 million and $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by increases in personal asset management\nrevenue and brokerage income. The Bancorp’s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $635 billion and $547\nbillion in total assets under care as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and managed $69 billion and $57 billion in assets for\nindividuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nService charges on deposits\nService charges on deposits increased $12 million and $36 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in service charges on commercial deposits.\nService charges on commercial deposits were $120 million and $350 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, increasing $11 million and $35 million from the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in revenue from\ncommercial payments activities, which include traditional treasury management and embedded payments.

The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in corporate bond fees, partially offset by a\ndecrease in foreign exchange fees. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily driven by decreases in revenue from commercial customer derivatives, foreign exchange fees and loan\nsyndication revenue, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond fees.\nCard and processing revenue\nCard and processing revenue increased $2 million and $6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in electronic funds transfer income. The increase\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included an increase in credit and debit card interchange, partially offset by increased\nreward costs.\nMortgage banking net revenue\nMortgage banking net revenue decreased $7 million and $30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:\nTABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOrigination fees and gains on loan sales $ 18 19 50 59\nNet mortgage servicing revenue:\nGross mortgage servicing fees 77 79 233 241\nNet valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives\npurchased to economically hedge MSRs (45) (41) (129) (116)\nNet mortgage servicing revenue 32 38 104 125\nTotal mortgage banking net revenue $ 50 57 154 184\nOrigination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $1 million and $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the impact of gains recognized during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA, partially offset by the\nimpacts of mark-to-market adjustments recognized on held for investment loans measured at fair value. Residential mortgage loan\noriginations increased to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates on originations. Residential mortgage loan originations were\n$4.6 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the Bancorp’s non-\nqualifying hedging strategy:\nTABLE 9: Components of Net Valuation Adjustments on MSRs\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChanges in fair value and settlement of free-standing derivatives purchased\nto economically hedge the MSR portfolio $ 45 (75) (17) (110)\nChanges in fair value:\nDue to changes in inputs or assumptions(a) (49) 73 1 107\nOther changes in fair value(b) (41) (39) (113) (113)\nNet valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives\npurchased to economically hedge MSRs $ (45) (41) (129) (116)\n(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates.\n(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time.\n14\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe Bancorp recognized losses of $90 million and $112 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in\nmortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio, compared to gains of $34 million and losses of $6 million for\nthe same periods in the prior year. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included a decrease of $49 million and an increase of $1\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and increases of $73 million and $107 million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future\nprepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which\ncaused an increase in prepayment speeds. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $41 million and $113 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and decreased $39 million and $113 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity.\nFurther detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp\nmaintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to\neconomically hedge the MSR portfolio. In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp\nacquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. Net gains and losses on these securities were immaterial for\nboth the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Bancorp’s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $112.4 billion and $118.5 billion,\nrespectively, with $95.8 billion and $101.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.\nLeasing business revenue\nLeasing business revenue decreased $15 million and $42 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in operating lease income, lease remarketing\nfees and lease syndication revenue.\nOther noninterest income\nThe following table presents the components of other noninterest income:\nTABLE 10: Components of Other Noninterest Income\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBOLI income $ 16 15 49 45\nCardholder fees 14 15 41 43\nPrivate equity investment income 12 13 33 39\nBanking center income 7 7 20 19\nConsumer loan fees 6 5 16 15\nEquity method investment income 5 3 13 48\nGains on sale of businesses 1 2 7 —\nLoss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

Class B Shares. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a decrease in equity method\ninvestment income.\nThe Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $47 million and $87 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to negative valuation adjustments of $10 million and $72 million during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 3.9 at September 30,\n2024 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2023. The taxable held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.6 at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nDebt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management’s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of,\nchanges in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and\nreported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading typically when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them\nin the near term. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale\ndebt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-\nsale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp did not recognize an allowance for credit losses for its investment\nsecurities. The Bancorp also did not recognize provision for credit losses for investment securities during both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Bancorp recognized impairment losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities of $11 million and $21 million during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with impairment losses of $1 million and $5 million during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These losses were included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income and related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions where the Bancorp had determined that it no\nlonger intended to hold the securities until the recovery of their amortized cost bases.\nThe following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:\nTABLE 16: Components of Investment Securities\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nAs of ($ in millions) 2024 2023\nAvailable-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis):\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 4,354 4,477\nObligations of states and political subdivisions securities — 2\nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities 5,623 11,564\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 24,008 28,945\nNon-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 4,677 4,872\nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities 4,315 5,207\nOther securities(a) 777 722\nTotal available-for-sale debt and other securities $ 43,754 55,789\nHeld-to-maturity securities (amortized cost basis):(b)\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 2,354 —\nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities 4,992 —\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 4,010 —\nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities 2 2\nTotal held-to-maturity securities $ 11,358 2\nTrading debt securities (fair value):\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 619 647\nObligations of states and political subdivisions securities 86 39\nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities 12 6\nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities 459 207\nTotal trading debt securities $ 1,176 899\nTotal equity securities (fair value) $ 428 613\n(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost.\n(b) Includes a discount of $897 at September 30, 2024 pertaining to the unamortized portion of unrealized losses on HTM securities.\nIn January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to\nreflect the Bancorp’s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with\ninvestment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential\n20\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nmortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. On the date of the transfer, pre-tax unrealized losses of\n$994 million were included in AOCI related to these transferred securities. The unrealized losses that existed on the date of transfer will\ncontinue to be reported as a component of AOCI and will be amortized into income over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment\nto yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization of unrealized losses related to securities transferred from available-for-sale to\nheld-to-maturity. At September 30, 2024, these transferred securities had an estimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years.\nTABLE 17: Estimated Amortization of Unrealized Losses on Securities Transferred to Held-to-Maturity\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 17\n2025 61\n2026 75\n2027 87\n2028 128\nThereafter 529\nUnamortized portion of unrealized losses $ 897\nOn an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities comprised 28% of total interest-\nearning assets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the\navailable-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 5.1 years and 6.2 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nIn addition, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.10% and 3.06%\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an\nestimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years and a weighted-average yield of 3.41%.\nInformation presented in Tables 18 and 19 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is\npresented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield\ncalculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity.\nThe fair values of investment securities are impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value\nof the Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Transaction deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases\nin money market deposits and interest checking deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and savings deposits. In response to\nthe higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into\nhigher interest-bearing products. Money market deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of\nhigher balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration.

In response to the higher interest rate\nenvironment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-\nbearing products. Average transaction deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits, partially\noffset by decreases in average demand deposits and average savings deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $5.3 billion, or\n10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the\naforementioned balance migration as well as average commercial balance growth, partially offset by lower average balances per consumer\ncustomer account.

Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership\ncategories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are\nadded together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $96.7\nbillion, or 57%, and $97.6 billion, or 58%, respectively, of the Bancorp’s domestic deposits were estimated to be insured. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $71.5 billion and $71.1 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp’s domestic deposits\nwere estimated to be uninsured. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of\ntime deposits were estimated to be uninsured. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the\namount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank’s\nregulators.\n25\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nBorrowings\nThe Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are\nclassified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities were 14% and 13% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:\nTABLE 23: Components of Borrowings\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nAs of ($ in millions) 2024 2023\nFederal funds purchased $ 169 193\nOther short-term borrowings 1,424 2,861\nLong-term debt 17,096 16,380\nTotal borrowings $ 18,689 19,434\nTotal borrowings decreased $745 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in other short-term borrowings\npartially offset by an increase in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings decreased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due\nto the maturity of FHLB advances, which were not replaced due to reduced short-term funding needs. The level of other short-term\nborrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs.\nFor further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Long-term debt increased $716 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the issuances of senior fixed-rate/\nfloating-rate notes in January and September of 2024 totaling $1.8 billion, long-term FHLB advances of $1.5 billion and fair value\nadjustments of $76 million associated with hedged long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by the redemptions or maturities of\n$2.3 billion of notes and $382 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations.\nThe following table summarizes components of average borrowings for the three months ended:\nTABLE 24: Components of Average Borrowings\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nFederal funds purchased $ 176 181\nOther short-term borrowings 3,024 4,126\nLong-term debt 16,716 14,056\nTotal average borrowings $ 19,916 18,363\nTotal average borrowings increased $1.6 billion, or 8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the\nprior year primarily due to an increase in average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in average other short-term borrowings.\nAverage long-term debt increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year\nprimarily driven by long-term debt transactions occurring since September 30, 2023, including the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate\nnotes in January and September of 2024 totaling $1.8 billion, long-term FHLB advances of $3.0 billion and fair value adjustments of $290\nmillion associated with hedged long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by redemptions or maturities of $2.3 billion of notes and\n$520 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations since September 30, 2023. Average other short-term borrowings decreased\n$1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased long-\nterm debt which reduced the need for short-term funding during the period. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed\nin the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk\nManagement subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp’s liquidity\nmanagement.\n26\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nBUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW\nThe Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset\nManagement. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Results of the Bancorp’s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting\npractices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s business\nsegments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from\ntime to time as management’s accounting practices and businesses change.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp eliminated certain revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and\nConsumer and Small Business Banking. As a result, the results of operations for the Wealth and Asset Management segment for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements between\nWealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking.\nThe Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are\ninsulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and\nacceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the\nestimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows\nallocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in\nbenchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and\ndeposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations\nare not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit\nrates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale\nfunding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing.\nThe Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated\ndurations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually.\nCredit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions.\nIn general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2023 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and\nrepricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products decreased modestly since December 31, 2023 due to modified\nassumptions and an inverted yield curve. As a result, net interest income for each segment was negatively impacted during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as a result of these updates to FTP charge and credit rates.\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with\nchanges in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business\nsegment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and\nOther. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the\nbusiness segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital\nmarkets as a collective unit.\nThe following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:\nTABLE 25: Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommercial Banking $ 393 718 1,080 2,009\nConsumer and Small Business Banking 497 739 1,524 2,145\nWealth and Asset Management 42 79 136 226\nGeneral Corporate and Other (359) (876) (1,046) (2,561)\nNet income $ 573 660 1,694 1,819\n27\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial Banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and\ngovernment and professional customers.

Refer to the Applicable Income Taxes subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for additional\ninformation.\nNet income was $393 million and $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $718\nmillion and $2.0 billion for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both periods were primarily driven by decreases in net\ninterest income on an FTE basis and increases in provision for credit losses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nalso impacted by a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis decreased $339 million and $994 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average balances of and rates paid on interest\nchecking deposits and money market deposits, decreases in FTP credits on deposits and decreases in average balances of commercial and\nindustrial loans, partially offset by increases in yields on average commercial loans. Net interest income for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was positively impacted by a decrease in FTP charges on commercial loans and leases, which was primarily attributable\nto lower average balances. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by an increase in FTP\ncharges, which was primarily attributable to higher FTP charge rates, partially offset by lower average balances.\nProvision for credit losses increased $76 million and $247 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in the allocated provision for credit losses related to commercial\ncriticized assets as well as increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average\nportfolio loans and leases increased to 39 bps and 34 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\n12 bps and 13 bps for the same periods in the prior year.\n28\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nNoninterest income increased $4 million and decreased $22 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by\nincreases in service charges on deposits and commercial banking revenue, partially offset by a decrease in leasing business revenue. The\ndecrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by decreases in leasing business revenue and commercial\nbanking revenue, partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposits. Leasing business revenue decreased $15 million and $42\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily\ndriven by decreases in operating lease income, lease remarketing fees and lease syndication fees. Commercial banking revenue increased $8\nmillion and decreased $13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the\nprior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven\nby an increase in corporate bond fees, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange fees. The decrease for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by decreases in revenue from commercial customer\nderivatives, foreign exchange fees and loan syndication revenue, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond fees. Service charges on\ndeposits increased $9 million and $32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods in the prior year primarily due to increases in revenue from commercial payments activities, which include traditional treasury\nmanagement and embedded payments.\nNoninterest expense decreased $8 million and $88 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in\nleasing business expense, partially offset by an increase in other noninterest expense. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 was driven by decreases in other noninterest expense and leasing business expense. Other noninterest expense increased $5 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in credit valuation\nadjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts. Other noninterest expense decreased $60 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in allocated expenses.\nLeasing business expense decreased $8 million and $25 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in depreciation expense associated with operating lease\nequipment.\nAverage commercial loans and leases decreased $5.2 billion and $5.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average commercial and industrial loans. Average\ncommercial and industrial loans decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior\nyear primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023.\nAverage deposits increased $3.3 billion and $4.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits,\npartially offset by decreases in average demand deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have generally\nmigrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. This migration\ncontributed to increases in average interest checking deposits of $6.4 billion and $9.2 billion for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, and increases in average money market deposits of $512 million and $548 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, along with a decrease in average demand\ndeposits of $3.6 billion and $5.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n29\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nConsumer and Small Business Banking\nConsumer and Small Business Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses through a\nnetwork of full-service banking centers and relationships with indirect and correspondent loan originators in addition to providing products\ndesigned to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services.

These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in\nyields on loans and leases.\nProvision for credit losses decreased $27 million and increased $11 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by an\nincrease in net charge-offs on solar energy installation loans. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on solar energy installation loans and indirect secured\nconsumer loans, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent\n30\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nof average portfolio loans and leases were 66 bps for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 90 bps and 65\nbps for the same periods in the prior year.\nNoninterest income increased $6 million and remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by increases in wealth and asset management revenue, partially offset by decreases in\nmortgage banking net revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $11 million and $26 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in broker income and\npersonal asset management revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for\nadditional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue.\nNoninterest expense decreased $20 million and $32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in other noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net occupancy\nand equipment expense. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a decrease in compensation and\nbenefits expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $12 million and $44 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in allocated expenses. The decrease for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a decrease in losses and adjustments. Net occupancy and equipment expense\nincreased $2 million and $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in\nthe prior year primarily driven by the Bancorp’s expansion into Southeast markets. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $11 million\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in base\ncompensation.\nAverage consumer loans decreased $105 million and $717 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average indirect secured consumer loans, average residential\nmortgage loans and average other consumer loans, partially offset by an increase in average solar energy installation loans. Average indirect\nsecured consumer loans decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year\nprimarily driven by paydowns exceeding loan originations and a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023. Average residential\nmortgage loans decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily\nas a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the\nBancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average other consumer loans decreased for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by the paydowns of loans\noriginated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in\nSeptember of 2022. Average solar energy installation loans increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe same periods in the prior year primarily due to increased loan originations. Average commercial loans increased $534 million and $619\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily\ndriven by increases in average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans as loan originations exceeded payoffs.\nThe increase for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by an increase in average commercial and industrial\nloans as loan originations exceeded payoffs.\nAverage deposits increased $1.9 billion and $3.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average money market deposits and average certificates of deposit,\npartially offset by decreases in average savings deposits, average interest checking deposits and average demand deposits. Average money\nmarket deposits increased $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and average\ncertificates of deposit increased $960 million and $3.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher offering rates and higher average balances per customer account as\nwell as balance migration from demand deposits, interest checking deposits and savings deposits. Average savings deposits decreased $2.1\nbillion and $3.0 billion, average interest checking deposits decreased $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion and average demand deposits decreased\n$528 million and $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the\nprior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per customer account as well as balance migration into certificates of deposit and\nmoney market accounts.\n31\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nWealth and Asset Management\nWealth and Asset Management provides a full range of wealth management solutions for individuals, companies and not-for-profit\norganizations, including wealth planning, investment management, banking, insurance, trust and estate services.

These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in interest expense on long-term debt. The increases in\nFTP charges allocated to the business segments were driven by increases in market interest rates, primarily across the fixed-rate asset\nportfolios. The decreases in FTP credits allocated to the business segments were driven by lower assumed liquidity premiums from deposit\nportfolios. Under the Bancorp’s internal reporting methodology, the Bancorp insulates the business segments from interest rate risk associated\n32\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nwith fixed-rate lending by transferring this risk to General Corporate and Other through the FTP methodology. As a result, the amount of FTP\ncredits on deposits earned by the business segments generally increases or decreases at a faster pace than the amount of allocated FTP charges\non loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses was $6 million and the benefit from credit losses was $165 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to provision for credit losses of $13 million and $201 million for the same periods in the prior\nyear. The benefit from credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in allocations to the\nbusiness segments.\nNoninterest income decreased $19 million and $22 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in the loss recognized on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.\nClass B Shares. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a decrease in equity method investment income,\nprimarily due to a gain on the partial disposition of an equity method investment during the second quarter of 2023.\nNoninterest expense increased $79 million and $171 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year, driven by increases in compensation and benefits expense, which were primarily attributable to increases\nin performance-based compensation, base compensation and employee benefits expense. The increase for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was also impacted by an increase in other noninterest expense, which was\nprimarily attributable to a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments, as\nwell as the incremental expenses associated with the Bancorp’s updated estimate of its allocated share of the FDIC’s special assessment.\n33\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW\nThe Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp’s\nEnterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity\nrisk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the\nBancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp’s processes related to operational\nrisk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with\nthe Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and\nreporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits\nand risk committees.\nThe objective of the Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well\nas to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the\nBancorp. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The\nBancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These\npractices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or\neliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp\ncarefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy also\nemphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, product and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely\nmanagement reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to\nextend credit are delegated specific authority based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting\nactivities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit\nRisk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk\nratings and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp’s credit review process and overall assessment of the\nadequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses\nthese assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Certain loans and leases with probable or observed\ncredit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for further information on the Bancorp’s credit rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating\ndefinitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain\nportfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.\nIn addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit\nreview process includes the use of two risk rating systems. The first of these risk rating systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk\nrating systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk\nrating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a “through-the-cycle” rating philosophy\nfor assessing a borrower’s creditworthiness. This “through-the-cycle” rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on\naverage default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes\nthirteen categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven categories for estimating losses given an event of default.\nThe probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system.\nThe Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that\nare collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss\npercentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the Bancorp’s processes for developing these models, for\nestimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually\nevaluated loans.\nFor the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned\nunder the dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of\nmacroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected\nutilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those\neconomic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those\ncharacteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nFor collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models\nprimarily utilize the borrower’s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the\nprobability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those\n34\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\ncharacteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in\nthe expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity)\nand portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected\nbalance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on\nmacroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes\nvarious scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and\nresidential mortgage portfolios.\nCommercial Portfolio\nThe Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has\ncommercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type.\nThe risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed\norigination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk\nmanagement reporting.\nThe Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic factors and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including, but not limited to, the\nlevel of inflation, labor and supply chain issues, volatility and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, including debt and\ndefault levels. Additionally, despite recent cuts, borrowers are expected to experience lingering effects from higher-for-longer interest rates.\nThe Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to concentrations.\nThe Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors\nand high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial loans and leases outline the risks and underwriting requirements for\nbusinesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow\ncoverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry and regional expertise to better monitor\nand manage different industry and geographic segments of the portfolio.\n35\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe following table provides detail on commercial loans and leases by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry\nClassification System), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorp’s commercial loans and leases as of:\nTABLE 29: Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio (excluding loans and leases held for sale)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n($ in millions) Outstanding Exposure Nonaccrual Outstanding Exposure Nonaccrual\nBy Industry:\nReal estate $ 12,969 19,616 6 12,558 19,679 4\nFinancial services and insurance 9,712 20,085 1 9,998 21,022 —\nManufacturing 9,103 18,975 57 9,010 19,101 54\nHealthcare 5,488 8,081 73 5,485 7,831 13\nBusiness services 5,312 9,734 53 5,917 10,339 50\nWholesale trade 5,130 10,327 18 5,259 10,414 6\nAccommodation and food 4,254 6,597 19 4,326 6,946 25\nRetail trade 3,565 8,580 47 3,953 9,847 85\nCommunication and information 3,201 6,084 — 3,191 6,482 60\nConstruction 2,725 6,401 7 2,656 6,391 10\nMining 2,568 6,269 33 2,813 5,940 —\nTransportation and warehousing 2,232 4,035 5 2,382 4,326 5\nUtilities 1,786 3,426 — 1,850 3,493 —\nEntertainment and recreation 1,611 2,917 5 1,687 2,964 8\nOther services 1,132 1,652 5 1,181 1,680 6\nAgribusiness 220 533 5 300 614 —\nPublic administration 110 178 — 151 240 —\nIndividuals 12 26 — 29 77 —\nTotal $ 71,130 133,516 334 72,746 137,386 326\nBy Loan Size:\nLess than $1 million 5 % 5 20 4 4 19\n$1 million to $5 million 7 5 15 7 6 11\n$5 million to $10 million 5 4 8 5 4 5\n$10 million to $25 million 13 11 24 14 11 23\n$25 million to $50 million 25 23 33 24 23 —\nGreater than $50 million 45 52 — 46 52 42\nTotal 100 % 100 100 100 100 100\nBy State:\nCalifornia 10 % 8 7 10 8 5\nTexas 9 9 11 9 9 1\nIllinois 9 8 8 9 8 5\nOhio 8 11 5 8 11 6\nFlorida 7 7 12 7 7 35\nNew York 7 6 6 7 6 —\nMichigan 5 5 4 5 5 3\nGeorgia 4 4 3 4 4 21\nTennessee 3 3 14 3 3 1\nIndiana 3 3 3 3 3 1\nNorth Carolina 3 3 2 3 3 2\nSouth Carolina 3 2 1 2 2 1\nOther 29 31 24 30 31 19\nTotal 100 % 100 100 100 100 100\nThe origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and\nconstruction lending.

The Bancorp has identified certain credit\ncharacteristics within these six categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan\nportfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for\nreal estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk\nthrough limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, specific geographic concentration risks and additional risk elements.\nThe Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the\nconsumer portfolio faces in a high-rate environment and as rates begin to fall. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer\nproducts fall within the Bancorp’s risk appetite. These guidelines are monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the\nprevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance limits.\nThe payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to\nchanges in benchmark interest rates. Previous increases in interest rates have caused minimum payments on these products to increase, raising\nthe potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. Recent rate cuts and potential future decreases in interest rates may\nlessen these risks moving forward. The impacts of these rate changes will take time to manifest and their significance will be dependent on\nthe size and number of current and future rate cuts. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to\nchanges in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio.\nResidential mortgage portfolio\nThe Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to loan\ncharacteristics determined to influence credit risk. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure product and\nchannel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.\nThe Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to make payments that are less than the accruing interest.\nThe Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $483 million of ARM loans will have rate\nresets during the next twelve months. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted-average origination\ndebt-to-income ratio of 34% and weighted-average origination LTV of 72%. Approximately 45% of these loans are expected to experience an\nincrease in rate upon reset. For those borrowers, rates are expected to increase by an average of approximately 1.8%, resulting in an average\nincrease in monthly payment amount of approximately 23%.\nCertain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp’s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in\nhousing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same\ncollateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans\nwith greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. Approximately two-thirds of these loans\nconsist of loans originated through the Bancorp’s loan program for doctors.\n38\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe following table provides an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination as of:\nTABLE 34: Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans by LTV at Origination\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted- Weighted-\n($ in millions) Outstanding Average LTV Outstanding Average LTV\nLTV ≤ 80% $ 11,634 63.3 % $ 11,718 62.7 %\nLTV > 80%, with mortgage insurance(a) 3,107 95.6 2,996 95.1\nLTV > 80%, no mortgage insurance 2,425 90.7 2,312 91.1\nTotal $ 17,166 73.2 % $ 17,026 72.4 %\n(a) Includes loans with either borrower or lender paid mortgage insurance.\nThe following tables provide an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by state with a greater than 80% LTV at\norigination and no mortgage insurance:\nTABLE 35: Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans, LTV Greater Than 80% at Origination, No Mortgage Insurance\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions)\n90 Days Past\nOutstanding Due and Accruing Nonaccrual\nBy State:\nOhio $ 499 1 6\nIllinois 480 — 4\nFlorida 434 — 2\nNorth Carolina 186 — —\nMichigan 164 — 2\nIndiana 164 — 2\nKentucky 123 — 1\nAll other states 375 — 5\nTotal $ 2,425 1 22\nTABLE 36: Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans, LTV Greater Than 80% at Origination, No Mortgage Insurance\nAs of December 31, 2023 ($ in millions)\n90 Days Past\nOutstanding Due and Accruing Nonaccrual\nBy State:\nOhio $ 512 — 8\nIllinois 462 1 4\nFlorida 407 — 1\nNorth Carolina 163 — 1\nMichigan 167 — 1\nIndiana 166 — 2\nKentucky 123 — 1\nAll other states 312 — 5\nTotal $ 2,312 1 23\nNet charge-offs on residential mortgage loans with a greater than 80% LTV at origination and no mortgage insurance were immaterial for\nboth the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Beginning in the first quarter of\n2013, the Bancorp’s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization\nperiod. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of\ninterest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 23% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp’s portfolio of\n39\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nhome equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to\n2028 and approximately $638 million of the balances mature before December 31, 2028.\nThe ACL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity\nportfolio that is collectively evaluated is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at\ndefault model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan\ndelinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the\nhome price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated\nwith current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting,\nmonitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality\ncontrol reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations.\nThe home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with\nan LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 38, Table 39 and Table\n40. Of the total $4.1 billion of outstanding home equity loans:\n• 74% reside within the Bancorp’s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of September 30,\n2024;\n• 32% are in senior lien positions and 68% are in junior lien positions at September 30, 2024;\n• 75% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months\nended September 30, 2024; and\n• The portfolio had a weighted-average refreshed FICO score of 748 at September 30, 2024.\nThe Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score\ndeterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after\norigination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact\nof the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or\nmore past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit\nbureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days\nor more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or\nmore past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

As described in Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nBancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of\nthe related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments). The Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of\nexpected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans\nand leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast\nexpected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the\nexpected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp’s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market\nand economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and\nsupportable.\nThe Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the\nportfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models. These factors\ninclude adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel\nand results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific\nidiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the\nquantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used\nto address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models, such as the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology.\nIn addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp’s methodology for\ndetermining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nFor the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each\ncommercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of\nmacroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected\nutilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those\neconomic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those\ncharacteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nFor collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models\nprimarily utilize the borrower’s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the\nprobability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those\ncharacteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in\nthe expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity)\nand portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected\nbalance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on\nmacroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the\nthree scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp’s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by\nthe Bancorp’s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable\nscenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario\n(Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession.\nThe Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time\nand worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will\nperform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a\n90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse.\nSeptember 30, 2024 ACL\nThe ACL as of September 30, 2024 was impacted by several factors when compared to December 31, 2023, including a more favorable\nmacroeconomic forecast and lower period-end loan and lease balances. As of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp’s macroeconomic scenarios\nincluded estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by expected interest rate cuts and geopolitical risks.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bancorp assigned an 80% probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10% to each of the Upside and\nDownside scenarios.\n48\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, economic growth remained resilient despite restrictive monetary policy. The FOMC continues to seek a soft\nlanding for the economy while balancing the risks of cutting rates too soon with the risks of maintaining a restrictive policy for too long.\nSeeing positive momentum in inflation trending toward its long-term target of 2%, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 50 bps in\nSeptember 2024. The Baseline scenario used in the September 30, 2024 ACL assumed a continued trend of positive inflation data with an\nexpectation that inflation will reach the FRB’s long-term target by early 2025, supported by an expectation that the FRB will continue to\nmaintain a reduced pace of quantitative tightening. In response to fiscal tightening and high interest rates, this scenario also assumed that real\nGDP growth would be below trend in the near term but that the unemployment rate will remain relatively steady.\nThe Baseline scenario assumed an average annual real GDP growth rate of 2.6% for 2024, followed by 2.1% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. The\nBaseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 4.1% for 2024 and 2025, slightly decreasing to an average of 4.0% in 2026.\nLastly, the Baseline scenario assumed additional cuts to the target federal funds rate beyond the third quarter of 2024, with an average federal\nfunds rate of 5.2% in 2024 that decreases to an average of 4.4% and 3.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The Upside scenario assumed that,\non an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 2.8% in 2024, 3.4% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. The Upside scenario also assumed an\naverage unemployment rate of 3.9%, 3.2% and 3.3% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for federal\nfunds rate cuts was generally consistent with the Baseline scenario. The Downside scenario included significant worsening of economic\nconditions, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Downside scenario assumed that real GDP\ndeclines from the third quarter of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025, with a cumulative decline of 2.6%, modestly recovering to an\naverage annualized GDP growth rate of 1.3% for the fourth quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2026. The Downside scenario assumed an\naverage unemployment rate of 4.4% in 2024, increasing to an average of 7.9% in 2025 and decreasing to an average of 7.6% in 2026. In the\nDownside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included steeper rate cuts than the Baseline scenario, with average target rates of\n5.1% in 2024, followed by 3.1% and 1.1% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nThe Bancorp’s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario\napproach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.0 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the\nimpact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional\nconsiderations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the Bancorp’s ACL:\nTABLE 51: Changes in Allowance for Credit Losses\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nALLL:\nBalance, beginning of period $ 2,288 2,327 2,322 2,194\nLosses charged-off(a) (183) (158) (511) (389)\nRecoveries of losses previously charged-off(a) 41 34 115 97\nProvision for loan and lease losses 159 137 379 487\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2022-02 — — — (49)\nBalance, end of period $ 2,305 2,340 2,305 2,340\nReserve for unfunded commitments:\nBalance, beginning of period $ 137 207 166 216\n(Benefit from) provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments 1 (18) (28) (27)\nBalance, end of period $ 138 189 138 189\n(a) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp recorded $6 and $22, respectively, in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses\npreviously charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit\nenhancements, compared to $8 and $26 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n49\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe following table provides an attribution of the Bancorp’s ALLL to portfolio loans and leases:\nTABLE 52: Attribution of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to Portfolio Loans and Leases\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nAs of ($ in millions) 2024 2023\nAttributed ALLL:\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 703 767\nCommercial mortgage loans 318 284\nCommercial construction loans 70 66\nCommercial leases 14 13\nResidential mortgage loans 143 145\nHome equity 105 102\nIndirect secured consumer loans 298 271\nCredit card 194 227\nSolar energy installation loans 333 292\nOther consumer loans 127 155\nTotal ALLL $ 2,305 2,322\nPortfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 50,916 53,270\nCommercial mortgage loans 11,394 11,276\nCommercial construction loans 5,947 5,621\nCommercial leases 2,873 2,579\nResidential mortgage loans(a) 17,166 17,026\nHome equity 4,074 3,916\nIndirect secured consumer loans 15,942 14,965\nCredit card 1,703 1,865\nSolar energy installation loans 4,078 3,728\nOther consumer loans 2,575 2,988\nTotal portfolio loans and leases $ 116,668 117,234\nAttributed ALLL as a percent of respective portfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans 1.38 % 1.44\nCommercial mortgage loans 2.79 2.52\nCommercial construction loans 1.18 1.17\nCommercial leases 0.49 0.50\nResidential mortgage loans 0.83 0.85\nHome equity 2.58 2.60\nIndirect secured consumer loans 1.87 1.81\nCredit card 11.39 12.17\nSolar energy installation loans 8.17 7.83\nOther consumer loans 4.93 5.19\nTotal ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases 1.98 % 1.98\nTotal ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases 2.09 2.12\n(a) Includes residential mortgage loans measured at fair value of $114 at September 30, 2024 and $116 at December 31, 2023.\nThe Bancorp’s ALLL may vary significantly from period to period based on changes in economic conditions, economic forecasts and the\ncomposition and credit quality of the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio.

This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp’s income\ncategories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are\nrelated to interest-sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial\ndeposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial\ninstruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.\nManagement considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for\nany one or more of the following reasons:\n• Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;\n• Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or\n• The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.\nIn addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their\neffect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the\nBancorp’s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not\nappropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp’s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a\nlesser extent price risk.\nManagement continually reviews the Bancorp’s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models\ninterest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market\nfactor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk\ntolerance for interest rate risk and price risk.\nThe Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading\nactivities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the\norigination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp’s\nTreasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk\nindicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance.\nThe Bancorp’s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit\nCommittee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The\nBancorp’s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors\ninterest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\nThe Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation\nmodel to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing\ncharacteristics for all of the Bancorp’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions\nregarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also\nincludes senior management’s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as\nother pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp’s net interest income but is a tool utilized\nto assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results\nwill differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude\nand frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market\nconditions and management strategies.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp’s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-\nmonth and 24-month horizons under parallel and non-parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for\nscenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over 12-month and 24-month horizons. The Bancorp routinely\nanalyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in\nrates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve, and employs\npolicy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures under these types of scenarios. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely\nevaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates.\nIn order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance migration or attrition in a rising interest rate environment, the\nBancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling assumes additional attrition of approximately $350 million of demand deposit balances over a period of\n24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates\napproximately $350 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short-\n51\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nterm market interest rates. The incremental balance attrition and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in\nconjunction with short-term market rate changes.\nAnother important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market\ninterest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the\nBancorp’s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta\nmodels to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the\nBancorp’s performance during prior interest rate cycles. Since the beginning of the current tightening cycle, the Bancorp’s actual cumulative\ninterest-bearing deposit beta through September 30, 2024 was approximately 55%-60%, as repricing has been similar to what was\nexperienced in prior interest rate cycles. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average\nrising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 79% for both a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates.\nIn the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped parallel\nscenarios of 69% and 68% for a 100 bps and 200 bps decrease in rates, respectively. In falling rate scenarios, deposit rate floors are utilized to\nensure modeled deposit rates will not become negative. NII simulation modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market\nrates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. Future actual performance will be\ndependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp\nprovides sensitivity analysis in Tables 54 and 55 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and demand deposit\nbalance performance.\nThe Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The\nBancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early\nwithdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities.\nThe following table shows the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of:\nTABLE 53: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n% Change in NII ALCO % Change in NII ALCO\n(FTE) Policy Limit (FTE) Policy Limit\n12 13-24 12 13-24 12 13-24 12 13-24\nChange in Interest Rates (bps) Months Months Months Months Months Months Months Months\n+200 Ramp over 12 months (3.89) % (5.18) (5.00) (6.00) (3.27) % (4.73) (4.00) (6.00)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months (1.90) (2.45) N/A N/A (1.62) (2.25) N/A N/A\n-100 Ramp over 12 months 1.06 0.57 N/A N/A 0.61 0.27 N/A N/A\n-200 Ramp over 12 months 1.79 1.08 (5.00) (6.00) 0.91 (0.18) (8.00) (12.00)\nTable 53 presents the change in estimated net interest income for 12 month and 13-24 month horizons for alternative interest rate scenarios\nrelative to the net interest income projection for a static rate scenario for those same time horizons. As previously mentioned, these numbers\ndo not represent a forecast, but are instead risk measures that are monitored to evaluate the consolidated interest rate risk position of the\nBancorp. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity in the rising-rate scenarios is negative in years one and two as interest expense\nis expected to increase more than interest income due to deposit repricing and balance migration estimates given the high interest rate\nenvironment. The Bancorp’s NII simulation projects an increase in NII in years one and two under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in\ninterest rates, driven by an expectation that deposits would reprice faster than earning assets. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity\nprofile compared to September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to increases in fixed-rate loans and interest-bearing core deposits\ncombined with reduced wholesale funding.\nTables 54 and 55 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp’s estimated NII profile at September 30, 2024 to changes to certain deposit balance\nand deposit repricing sensitivity (beta) assumptions.\n52\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe following table includes the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile with an immediate $1 billion decrease and an immediate $1\nbillion increase in demand deposit balances as of September 30, 2024:\nTABLE 54: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile at September 30, 2024 with a $1 Billion Change in Demand Deposit Assumption\n% Change in NII (FTE)\nImmediate $1 Billion Balance Immediate $1 Billion Balance\nDecrease Increase\n12 13-24 12 13-24\nChange in Interest Rates (bps) Months Months Months Months\n+200 Ramp over 12 months (4.95) % (6.32) (2.84) (4.03)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months (2.87) (3.43) (0.94) (1.46)\n-100 Ramp over 12 months 0.28 (0.09) 1.83 1.22\n-200 Ramp over 12 months 1.11 0.58 2.47 1.57\nThe following table includes the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile with a 10% increase and a 10% decrease to the corresponding\ndeposit beta assumptions as of September 30, 2024:\nTABLE 55: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile at September 30, 2024 with Deposit Beta Assumptions Changes\n% Change in NII (FTE)\nBetas 10% Higher(a) Betas 10% Lower(a)\n12 13-24 12 13-24\nChange in Interest Rates (bps) Months Months Months Months\n+200 Ramp over 12 months (5.54) % (8.24) (2.27) (2.14)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months (2.72) (3.96) (1.09) (0.94)\n-100 Ramp over 12 months 1.79 1.89 0.33 (0.75)\n-200 Ramp over 12 months 3.22 3.55 0.36 (1.40)\n(a) Applies a +/- 10% multiple on assumed betas.\nEconomic Value of Equity Sensitivity\nThe Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool to govern and manage its interest rate risk exposure. The exposure is governed by a risk\nframework that uses policy limits for scenarios assuming an instantaneous 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates. The\nBancorp routinely analyzes exposures to other interest rate scenarios and employs policy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and\nmanage exposures. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and\ntwo-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions\nthat incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value\nof all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of\nEVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does\nnot incorporate any assumptions related to continued production or renewal activities used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII\nsimulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis.\nParticularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-\nlived deposits.\nThe following table shows the Bancorp’s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of:\nTABLE 56: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n% Change in ALCO % Change in ALCO\nChange in Interest Rates (bps) EVE Policy Limit EVE Policy Limit\n+200 Shock (4.50) % (12.00) (5.92) % (12.00)\n+100 Shock (1.78) N/A (2.39) N/A\n-100 Shock 0.87 N/A 1.88 N/A\n-200 Shock (1.55) (12.00) 2.21 (12.00)\nThe EVE sensitivity is negative in both a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and in a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at September 30, 2024. The\nchanges in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from September 30, 2023 were primarily related to changes in forward interest rate\nexpectations and shortening of the investment portfolio duration in both rising and falling rate scenarios, which was partially offset by an\nincrease in fixed-rate loans and reduced wholesale funding.\nWhile an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a\ngradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the\n53\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nestimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter\ntime horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product\nmix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest\nrates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in\nresponse to actual changes in interest rates.\nThe Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, basis risks relative to the Prime Rate and various SOFR\nterms, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in\ninterest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk\nAn integral component of the Bancorp’s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant\nfluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its\ninterest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting\ninterest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.\nTables 57 and 58 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp’s exposures to the variability of\ninterest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e.,\nnotional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified\ninterest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk\nmanagement objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third’s asset and liability\nmanagement activities:\nTABLE 57: Summary of Qualifying Hedging Instruments\nWeighted-Average\nNotional Fair Remaining\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Amount Value Term (years) Fixed Rate Index\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed $ 8,000 (10) 5.4 3.02 % SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed –\nforward starting(a) 4,000 — 7.2 3.14 SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to commercial mortgage and commercial\nconstruction loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting(a) 4,000 — 7.3 3.50 SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to long-term debt – fair value – receive-\nfixed 5,955 (27) 4.1 5.18 SOFR\nTotal interest rate swaps $ 21,955 (37)\nInterest rate floors related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed $ 3,000 — 0.2 2.25 SOFR\n(a) Forward starting swaps will become effective on various dates between December 2024 and February 2025.\nTABLE 58: Summary of Qualifying Hedging Instruments\nWeighted-Average\nNotional Remaining\nAs of December 31, 2023 ($ in millions) Amount Fair Value Term (years) Fixed Rate Index\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed $ 8,000 (9) 4.4 3.02 % SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed –\nforward starting(a) 6,000 5 7.8 3.11 SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to commercial mortgage and commercial\nconstruction loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting(a) 4,000 — 8.1 3.50 SOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to long-term debt – fair value – receive-\nfixed 5,955 (32) 4.9 5.18 SOFR\nTotal interest rate swaps $ 23,955 (36)\nInterest rate floors related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed $ 3,000 1 1.0 2.25 SOFR\n(a) Forward starting swaps will become effective on various dates between June 2024 and February 2025.\nAdditionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into\nforward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives.\nThe Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage\n54\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\noptions as well. Refer to the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to\neconomically hedge this exposure.\nThe Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate\nderivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market\nvolatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes\nthrough collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to\nhelp ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of\ninterest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk\nmanagement. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk\nThe fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.7 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The value of servicing\nrights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid\nto take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid\nloans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest\nIncome subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy\nrelative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a\nresult of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR\nportfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes\nto Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on\nMSRs.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives\nare classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp’s foreign denominated loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nwas $812 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial\ncustomers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts\nentered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to\neconomically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and\ninternal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an\nindependent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country\nlimits performed by independent risk management.\nCommodity Risk\nThe Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price\nfluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into\ncommodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven\ncommodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and\ninternal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an\nindependent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals\nperformed by independent risk management.\n55\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit\nwithdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and\ninvestment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits.\nA summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Bancorp’s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections,\nwhich incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the\nTreasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to\nensure risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity\nstress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The\ncontingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for\nunexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp’s\nresponse to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios.\nLiquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp (parent company) receives\nsubstantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends\nare supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and\nscheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form\nof share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market\ndisruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\nperiod of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon.\nThe Bancorp’s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity\nand funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk\nmanagement function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.\nSources of Funds\nThe Bancorp’s primary sources of funds include revenue from noninterest income as well as cash flows from loan and lease repayments,\npayments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in\naddition to the use of borrowings.\nOf the $52.0 billion in fair value of securities in the Bancorp’s available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities\nportfolios at September 30, 2024, $7.6 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $8.5\nbillion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp’s securities portfolio, refer to the\nInvestment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.\nAsset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp’s ability to monetize loans and leases through repurchase agreements, outright sales,\nsecuritizations or pledging to secured borrowing sources. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity,\nthe Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-\nrate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination.\nAdditional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans,\nsolar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling $1.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, compared to $3.3\nbillion and $5.9 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 13 of\nthe Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCore deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp’s average\ncore deposits and average shareholders’ equity funded 86% and 85% of its average total assets for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 85% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to core deposit\nfunding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system.\nManagement does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.\nIn June of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized $10.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $7.0 billion of debt or other\nsecurities were available for issuance as of September 30, 2024. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with\nthe SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The\nBancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion in January 2024 and $750 million in September 2024, as further\ndiscussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $19.4 billion was\navailable for issuance. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $68.5 billion of borrowing capacity available\nthrough secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and the FHLB.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nThe Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $100 billion in current available liquidity.\nRefer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for more information regarding the Bancorp’s deposit\nportfolio characteristics. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on\ncore deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources\nacross the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. The Bancorp’s investment\nportfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity.\nAs part of its liquidity management activities, the Bancorp maintains collateral at its secured funding providers to ensure immediate\navailability of funding. Additionally, the Bancorp executes periodic test trades to assess the operational processes associated with its secured\nfunding sources.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp (parent company) had sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and\ncommon dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 36 months.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp’s or Bank’s\ncredit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp’s\nor Bank’s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong\ncredit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.\nThe Bancorp’s and Bank’s credit ratings are summarized in Table 59. The ratings reflect the ratings agency’s view on the Bancorp’s and\nBank’s capacity to meet financial commitments.*\n*As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to\nrevision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other\nrating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit\nrating agency.\nTABLE 59: Agency Ratings\nAs of November 5, 2024 Moody’s Standard and Poor’s Fitch DBRS Morningstar\nFifth Third Bancorp:\nShort-term borrowings No rating A-2 F1 R-1L\nSenior debt Baa1 BBB+ A- A\nSubordinated debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ AL\nFifth Third Bank, National Association:\nShort-term borrowings P-2 A-2 F1 R-1M\nShort-term deposit P-1 No rating F1 No rating\nLong-term deposit A1 No rating A AH\nSenior debt A3 A- A- AH\nSubordinated debt A3 BBB+ BBB+ A\nRating Agency Outlook for Fifth Third Bancorp and\nFifth Third Bank, National Association Stable Stable Stable Stable\n57\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nManagement regularly reviews the Bancorp’s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating\nenvironments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to\nmanagement. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The\nCapital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.\nRegulatory Capital Ratios\nThe Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of “well-capitalized” for insured depository\ninstitutions.\nTABLE 60: Prescribed Capital Ratios\nMinimum Well-Capitalized\nCET1 capital:\nFifth Third Bancorp 4.50 % N/A\nFifth Third Bank, National Association 4.50 6.50\nTier 1 risk-based capital:\nFifth Third Bancorp 6.00 6.00\nFifth Third Bank, National Association 6.00 8.00\nTotal risk-based capital:\nFifth Third Bancorp 8.00 10.00\nFifth Third Bank, National Association 8.00 10.00\nLeverage:\nFifth Third Bancorp 4.00 N/A\nFifth Third Bank, National Association 4.00 5.00\nThe Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory\nminimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive\nofficers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. As of September\n30, 2024, the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer requirement was 2.5%. Effective October 1, 2024, the stress capital buffer increased to 3.2%.\nThe Bancorp’s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented.\nThe Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp’s modified CECL transition amount began phasing out on\nJanuary 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp’s\nregulatory capital at September 30, 2024 was an increase in capital of approximately $124 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp’s\nCET1 capital ratio would be reduced by 7 bps as of September 30, 2024.\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the Basel III Capital Rules, which would\nmodify its existing risk-based capital framework for large banks and introduce a new framework that implements international capital\nstandards. The proposed rulemaking would adjust capital requirements applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or\nmore, including Fifth Third, and would align the calculation of regulatory capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large\nbanking organizations. As proposed, the rules would be effective for the Bancorp on July 1, 2025 and phased in over a three-year transition\nperiod. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact.\nOn August 29, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require that certain banking organizations with\n$100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including Fifth Third, comply with certain long-term debt requirements at the holding company\nand insured depository institution levels. These proposed requirements are intended to increase loss absorbing capacity at insured depository\ninstitutions in order to reduce the cost of recapitalization in the event of the closure of a banking organization. As proposed, the rules would\nbe phased in over a three-year period after their effective date. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and\nassessing its potential impact, which is dependent on the finalization of the aforementioned proposed capital rule.\n58\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nThe following table summarizes the Bancorp’s capital ratios as of:\nTABLE 61: Capital Ratios\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nQuarterly average total Bancorp shareholders’ equity as a percent of average assets 9.47 % 8.04\nTangible equity as a percent of tangible assets(a)(b) 8.99 8.65\nTangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets(a)(b) 8.00 7.67\nRegulatory capital:(c)\nCET1 capital $ 17,272 16,800\nTier 1 capital 19,388 18,916\nTotal regulatory capital 22,691 22,400\nRisk-weighted assets 160,604 163,223\nRegulatory capital ratios:(c)\nCET1 capital 10.75 % 10.29\nTier 1 risk-based capital 12.07 11.59\nTotal risk-based capital 14.13 13.72\nLeverage 9.11 8.73\n(a) These are non-GAAP measures.

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards\ntailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan\napproved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The Bancorp is also subject to the FRB’s supervisory stress tests every two years. The\nBancorp was subject to the 2024 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted its Board-approved capital plan, as required, by\nthe April 5, 2024 deadline.\nDividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program\nThe Bancorp’s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to\nmaintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices\nas well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.37 and $0.35 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.07 and $1.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Pursuant to the Bancorp’s Board-approved capital plan, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp entered\ninto and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions.

This information contains\ncertain statements that the Bancorp believes are forward-looking statements. Refer to page 1 for cautionary information regarding forward-\nlooking statements.\nControls and Procedures (Item 4)\nThe Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp’s management, including the\nBancorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on the foregoing, as\nof the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the\nBancorp’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports the Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and\nwhen required and information is accumulated and communicated to the Bancorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Bancorp’s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes\noccurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorp’s\ninternal control over financial reporting. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp implemented a new general ledger accounting system. The\nnew general ledger accounting system was implemented in order to standardize processes, improve efficiency and enhance management\nreporting and analysis, and was subject to thorough testing and review both before and after final implementation. This implementation has\nnot materially affected, and the Bancorp does not expect it to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\n60\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes (Item 1)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited)\nAs of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions, except share data) 2024 2023\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 3,215 3,142\nOther short-term investments(a) 21,729 22,082\nAvailable-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost of $43,754 and $55,789) 40,396 50,419\nHeld-to-maturity securities (fair value of $11,554 and $2) 11,358 2\nTrading debt securities 1,176 899\nEquity securities 428 613\nLoans and leases held for sale (includes $512 and $334 of residential mortgage loans measured at fair value) 612 378\nPortfolio loans and leases(a) (includes $114 and $116 of residential mortgage loans measured at fair value) 116,668 117,234\nAllowance for loan and lease losses(a) (2,305) (2,322)\nPortfolio loans and leases, net 114,363 114,912\nBank premises and equipment (includes $24 and $19 held for sale) 2,425 2,349\nOperating lease equipment 357 459\nGoodwill 4,918 4,919\nIntangible assets 98 125\nServicing rights 1,656 1,737\nOther assets(a) 11,587 12,538\nTotal Assets $ 214,318 214,574\nLiabilities\nDeposits:\nNoninterest-bearing deposits $ 41,393 43,146\nInterest-bearing deposits 126,947 125,766\nTotal deposits 168,340 168,912\nFederal funds purchased 169 193\nOther short-term borrowings 1,424 2,861\nAccrued taxes, interest and expenses 2,034 2,195\nOther liabilities(a) 4,471 4,861\nLong-term debt(a) 17,096 16,380\nTotal Liabilities $ 193,534 195,402\nEquity\nCommon stock(b) $ 2,051 2,051\nPreferred stock(c) 2,116 2,116\nCapital surplus 3,784 3,757\nRetained earnings 23,820 22,997\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (3,446) (4,487)\nTreasury stock(b) (7,541) (7,262)\nTotal Equity $ 20,784 19,172\nTotal Liabilities and Equity $ 214,318 214,574\n(a) Includes $50 and $55 of other short-term investments, $1,131 and $1,573 of portfolio loans and leases, $(21) and $(28) of ALLL, $8 and $10 of other assets, $13\nand $14 of other liabilities and $1,008 and $1,409 of long-term debt from consolidated VIEs that are included in their respective captions above at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Basis of Presentation\nThe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in\nwhich the Bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. Other entities, including certain joint ventures in which the Bancorp\nhas the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, but upon which the Bancorp does not\npossess control, are accounted for by the equity method and not consolidated. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp does not\nhave the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at fair value unless the investment does not have a readily determinable\nfair value. The Bancorp accounts for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative to fair\nvalue, representing the cost of the investment minus any impairment recorded and plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for an identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Intercompany transactions and balances among\nconsolidated entities have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of management, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the results for the periods presented. In accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and\nregulations of the SEC for interim financial information, these statements do not include certain information and footnote disclosures required\nfor complete annual financial statements and it is suggested that these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements be read in conjunction\nwith the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations, comprehensive income and changes in equity for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Financial information as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the\nBancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n2. Supplemental Cash Flow Information\nCash payments related to interest and income taxes in addition to non-cash investing and financing activities are presented in the following\ntable for the nine months ended September 30:\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nCash Payments:\nInterest $ 3,795 2,554\nIncome taxes 126 496\nTransfers:\nPortfolio loans and leases to loans and leases held for sale $ 333 281\nLoans and leases held for sale to portfolio loans and leases 3 5\nPortfolio loans and leases to OREO 16 9\nBank premises and equipment to OREO 7 29\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity securities(a) 11,593 —\nSupplemental Disclosures:\nNet additions to lease liabilities under operating leases $ 59 56\nNet additions (reductions) to lease liabilities under finance leases 45 (6)\n(a) Represents the fair value of the securities on the date of transfer.

Accounting and Reporting Developments\nStandards Adopted in 2024\nThe Bancorp adopted the following new accounting standards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nASU 2022-03 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, which clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security\nthat is subject to contractual sale restrictions, stating that such restrictions are not considered part of the unit of account of the security and\ntherefore are not considered in measuring fair value. The amended guidance also requires disclosure of the fair value of equity securities\nsubject to contractual sale restrictions and certain additional information about those restrictions. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance\non January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Bancorp’s Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nASU 2023-02 – Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the\nProportional Amortization Method\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, which expands the permitted usage of the proportional amortization method to include\nadditional tax credit investment programs beyond qualifying LIHTC structures if certain conditions are met. The amended guidance permits\nentities to make elections to apply the proportional amortization method on a program-by-program basis for qualifying programs and also\nmakes certain amendments to measurement and disclosure guidance. The amended disclosure guidance applies to all investments within\nprograms where the proportional amortization method has been elected, including investments within those programs which do not meet the\ncriteria to permit application of the proportional amortization method. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2024 on a\nmodified retrospective basis, except for certain provisions which the Bancorp adopted on a prospective basis, as permitted. Upon adoption,\nthe Bancorp recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $10 million, net of tax.\nASU 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which amends the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. The amendments\ninclude new requirements to disclose certain significant segment expenses and other items, the title and position of the chief operating\ndecision maker and information about how the reported measures of segment profit or loss are used in assessing segment performance. The\namendments also make certain annual disclosure requirements applicable to interim periods and permit the reporting of multiple measures of\nsegment profit or loss if appropriate. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp for the year ending December 31, 2024 and\nsubsequent interim reporting periods beginning in 2025, with early adoption permitted. Consistent with this implementation guidance, the\nBancorp will provide the amended disclosures within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the\namendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented.\nSignificant Accounting Standard Issued but Not Yet Adopted\nThe following significant accounting standard was issued but not yet adopted by the Bancorp as of September 30, 2024:\nASU 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which amends the disclosure requirements for income taxes. The amendments primarily\ninclude new requirements to disclose additional information as part of the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to statutory tax rates, provide\nthe amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, and income tax expense disaggregated between federal, state and foreign\njurisdictions and provide income before income taxes disaggregated between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The amendments also\ndiscontinue certain other disclosure requirements. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2025, with early adoption\npermitted, and is to be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating the impact\nof the amended guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n4.

The five categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating\ndefinitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter.\nPass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well-defined weaknesses and for which there is a\nhigh likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other\ncategories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter.\nThe Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If\nleft uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or\nlease or the Bancorp’s credit position.\nThe Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity\nof the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans and leases have well-defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize\nthe orderly repayment of the debt. Loans and leases with this rating also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bancorp will\nsustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected.\nThe Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that\nthe weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and\nimprobable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work\nto the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact\nstatus may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting\nliens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.\n76\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nLoans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off in the period in which they are determined to be\nuncollectible. Because loans and leases in this category are fully charged off, they are not included in the following tables.\nFor loans and leases that are collectively evaluated for an ACL, the Bancorp utilizes models to forecast expected credit losses over a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of\ndefault and the expected loss percentage given a default. For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are\nprimarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings\nmigrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected\nbalance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization\nhistory of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and\ncoverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. For more information about the\nBancorp’s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period\nand for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nthe Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the\nsegment into the following classes: home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card, solar energy installation loans and other\nconsumer loans. The Bancorp’s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a separate class.\nThe Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer loans, which\nincludes both the delinquency status and performing versus nonperforming status of the loans. The delinquency status of all residential\nmortgage and consumer loans and the performing versus nonperforming status are presented in the following tables.\nFor collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models\nprimarily utilize the borrower’s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the\nprobability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those\ncharacteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in\nthe expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity)\nand portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected\nbalance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on\nmacroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions.

When a loan or lease is collateral-dependent, its fair value\nis generally based on the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying collateral.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of the Bancorp’s collateral-dependent loans and leases, by portfolio class, as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nCommercial loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 206 268\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 63 8\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans 4 2\nCommercial construction loans 1 1\nTotal commercial loans and leases $ 274 279\nResidential mortgage loans 130 126\nConsumer loans:\nHome equity 62 54\nIndirect secured consumer loans 25 15\nTotal consumer loans $ 87 69\nTotal portfolio loans and leases $ 491 474\n82\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest\nis uncertain and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of the Bancorp’s nonaccrual loans and leases, by class, and OREO and other\nrepossessed property as of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWith an No Related With an No Related\nTotal Total\n($ in millions) ALLL ALLL ALLL ALLL\nCommercial loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 217 38 255 273 31 304\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 50 24 74 11 6 17\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans — 4 4 — 3 3\nCommercial construction loans — 1 1 — 1 1\nCommercial leases — — — — 1 1\nTotal nonaccrual portfolio commercial loans and leases $ 267 67 334 284 42 326\nResidential mortgage loans 43 88 131 26 98 124\nConsumer loans:\nHome equity 22 45 67 21 36 57\nIndirect secured consumer loans 42 8 50 32 4 36\nCredit card 31 — 31 34 — 34\nSolar energy installation loans 64 — 64 60 — 60\nOther consumer loans 9 — 9 12 — 12\nTotal nonaccrual portfolio consumer loans $ 168 53 221 159 40 199\nTotal nonaccrual portfolio loans and leases(a)(b) $ 478 208 686 469 180 649\nOREO and other repossessed property — 39 39 — 39 39\nTotal nonperforming portfolio assets(a)(b) $ 478 247 725 469 219 688\n(a) Excludes $8 and $1 of nonaccrual loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(b) Includes $20 and $19 of nonaccrual government-insured commercial loans whose repayments are insured by the SBA as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nThe Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans and leases for both the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Bancorp’s amortized cost basis of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings are in process according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction was $101 million and $107 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nIn the course of servicing its loans, the Bancorp works with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty to identify solutions that are\nmutually beneficial to both parties with the objective of mitigating the risk of losses on the loan. These efforts often result in modifications to\nthe payment terms of the loan. The types of modifications offered to borrowers vary by type of loan and may include term extensions, interest\nrate reductions, payment delays (other than those that are insignificant) or combinations thereof. The Bancorp typically does not provide\nprincipal forgiveness except in circumstances where the loan has already been fully or partially charged off.\nThe Bancorp applies its expected credit loss models consistently to both modified and non-modified loans when estimating the ALLL. For\nloans which are modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, there is generally not a significant change to the ALLL upon\nmodification because the Bancorp’s ALLL estimation methodologies already consider those borrowers’ financial difficulties and the resulting\neffects of potential modifications when estimating expected credit losses.\nPortfolio loans with an amortized cost basis of $184 million and $171 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were\nmodified during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $373 million and $484 million were modified\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as further\ndiscussed in the following sections. These modifications for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 represented 0.16% and\n0.14%, respectively, of total portfolio loans and leases as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.32% and 0.40% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts excluded $19 million and $6 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $42 million and $24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, of consumer and residential mortgage loans which have been granted a concession under provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy\n83\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nAct and are monitored separately from loans modified under the Bancorp’s loan modification programs. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bancorp had commitments of $80 million and $130 million, respectively, to lend additional funds to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty whose terms have been modified during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nCommercial portfolio segment\nCommercial loan modifications are individually negotiated and may vary depending on the borrower’s financial situation, but the Bancorp\nmost commonly utilizes term extensions for periods of three to twelve months. In less common situations and when specifically warranted by\nthe borrower’s situation, the Bancorp may also consider offering commercial borrowers interest rate reductions or payment delays, which\nmay be combined with a term extension.\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of the Bancorp’s commercial portfolio\nloans that were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, by portfolio class and type of modification:\nTerm Extension\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 Term and Payment Payment % of Total\n($ in millions) Extension Delay Delay Other Total Class\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 84 2 19 — 105 0.21 %\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 11 — — — 11 0.20\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans 28 — — — 28 0.47\nCommercial construction loans 6 — — — 6 0.10\nTotal commercial portfolio loans $ 129 2 19 — 150 0.22 %\nTerm Extension\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 Term and Payment Payment % of Total\n($ in millions) Extension Delay Delay Other Total Class\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 92 8 — 1 101 0.18 %\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 3 — — — 3 0.06\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans 1 — — — 1 0.02\nCommercial construction loans 19 — — — 19 0.34\nTotal commercial portfolio loans $ 115 8 — 1 124 0.17 %\nTerm Extension\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Term and Payment Payment % of Total\n($ in millions) Extension Delay Delay Other Total Class\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 164 20 23 1 208 0.41 %\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 25 — 1 — 26 0.48\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans 28 — — — 28 0.47\nCommercial construction loans 6 — — — 6 0.10\nTotal commercial portfolio loans $ 223 20 24 1 268 0.39 %\nTerm Extension\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 Term and Payment Payment % of Total\n($ in millions) Extension Delay Delay Other Total Class\nCommercial and industrial loans $ 176 8 5 2 191 0.34 %\nCommercial mortgage owner-occupied loans 24 — — — 24 0.45\nCommercial mortgage nonowner-occupied loans 21 — — 3 24 0.42\nCommercial construction loans 116 — — — 116 2.08\nTotal commercial portfolio loans $ 337 8 5 5 355 0.47 %\nResidential mortgage portfolio segment\nThe Bancorp has established residential mortgage loan modification programs which define the type of modifications available as well as the\neligibility criteria for borrowers. The designs of the Bancorp’s modification programs for residential mortgage loans are similar to those\nutilized by the various GSEs. The most common modification program utilized for residential mortgage loans is a term extension for up to\n480 months from the modification date, combined with a change in interest rate to a fixed rate (which may be an increase or decrease from\nthe rate in the original loan). As part of these modifications, the Bancorp may capitalize delinquent amounts due at the time of the\nmodification into the principal balance of the loan when determining its modified payment structure. For loans where the modification results\nin a new monthly payment amount, borrowers may be required to complete a trial period of three to four months before the loan is\npermanently modified. The Bancorp also offers payment delay modifications to qualified borrowers which allow either the delay of\n84\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nrepayment for delinquent amounts due until maturity or capitalization of delinquent amounts due into the principal balance of the loan. The\nnumber of monthly payments delayed varies by borrower but is most commonly within a range of six to twelve months.\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of the Bancorp’s residential mortgage\nportfolio loans that were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, by type of modification:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n% of Total % of Total\nFor the three months ended ($ in millions) Total Class Total Class\nPayment delay $ 1 0.01 % $ 3 0.02 %\nTerm extension and payment delay 17 0.10 27 0.15\nTerm extension, interest rate reduction and payment delay 4 0.02 1 0.01\nTotal residential mortgage portfolio loans $ 22 0.13 % $ 31 0.18 %\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n% of Total % of Total\nFor the nine months ended ($ in millions) Total Class Total Class\nPayment delay $ 5 0.03 % $ 16 0.09 %\nTerm extension and payment delay 61 0.36 69 0.40\nTerm extension, interest rate reduction and payment delay 8 0.05 4 0.02\nTotal residential mortgage portfolio loans $ 74 0.43 % $ 89 0.51 %\nThe Bancorp had $4 million and $7 million of in-process modifications to residential mortgage loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, which are excluded from the completed modification activity in the tables above. These in-process modifications will\nbe reported as completed modifications once the borrower satisfies the applicable contingencies in the modification agreement and the loan is\ncontractually modified to make the modified terms permanent.\nConsumer portfolio segment\nThe Bancorp’s modification programs for consumer loans vary based on type of loan. The most common modification program for home\nequity is a term extension for up to 360 months combined with a delay in repayment of delinquent amounts due until maturity, which is\ntypically combined with an interest rate reduction. Modification programs for credit card typically involve an interest rate reduction and an\nincrease to the minimum monthly payment in order to repay a larger portion of outstanding balances. Modifications for indirect secured\nconsumer loans, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are less commonly utilized as part of the Bancorp’s loss mitigation\nactivities and programs vary by specific product type.\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of the Bancorp’s consumer portfolio\nloans that were

Similarly, the\nBancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously\nbeen held for future branch expansion. The Bancorp closed a total of 28 banking centers throughout its footprint during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nThe Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their\ncarrying values may not be recoverable.

Goodwill\nBusiness combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically result in the recognition of goodwill. Acquisition activity includes acquisitions\nin the respective period in addition to purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions.\nThe Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at\nthe reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp\nevaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking industry and market conditions\nand key financial metrics of the Bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall Bancorp financial performance. After assessing the totality of\nthe events and circumstances, the Bancorp determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Commercial Banking,\nConsumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts\nand, therefore, the quantitative goodwill impairment test was deemed unnecessary.\nChanges in the net carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting unit, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 were as follows:\nConsumer and Wealth General\nCommercial Small Business and Asset Corporate\n($ in millions) Banking Banking Management and Other Total\nGoodwill $ 3,074 2,580 226 — 5,880\nAccumulated impairment losses (750) (215) — — (965)\nNet carrying value as of December 31, 2022 2,324 2,365 226 — 4,915\nAcquisition activity — 4 — — 4\nNet carrying value as of December 31, 2023 2,324 2,369 226 — 4,919\nSale of business — — (1) — (1)\nNet carrying value as of September 30, 2024 $ 2,324 2,369 225 — 4,918\n91\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n11. Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, developed technology, customer relationships and other intangible assets which include\ntrade names, backlog, operating leases and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated\nbasis over their estimated useful lives and, based on the type of intangible asset, the amortization expense may be recorded in either leasing\nbusiness revenue or other noninterest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe details of the Bancorp’s intangible assets are shown in the following table:\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\n($ in millions) Amount Amortization Amount\nAs of September 30, 2024\nCore deposit intangibles $ 206 (192) 14\nDeveloped technology 106 (46) 60\nCustomer relationships 28 (9) 19\nOther 13 (8) 5\nTotal intangible assets $ 353 (255) 98\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCore deposit intangibles $ 209 (184) 25\nDeveloped technology 106 (33) 73\nCustomer relationships 30 (10) 20\nOther 16 (9) 7\nTotal intangible assets $ 361 (236) 125\nAs of September 30, 2024, all of the Bancorp’s intangible assets were being amortized. Amortization expense recognized on intangible assets\nwas $8 million and $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $27 million and $33 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Bancorp’s projections of amortization expense shown in the\nfollowing table are based on existing asset balances as of September 30, 2024. Future amortization expense may vary from these projections.\nEstimated amortization expense for the remainder of 2024 through 2028 is as follows:\n($ in millions) Total\nRemainder of 2024 $ 9\n2025 28\n2026 22\n2027 14\n2028 9\n92\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n12. Variable Interest Entities\nThe Bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient\nequity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack\nany of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The Bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the\ndefinition of a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held\nboth at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. If the Bancorp is determined to be the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE, it must account for the VIE as a consolidated subsidiary. If the Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary\nof a VIE but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other\naccounting standards as appropriate.\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe Bancorp has consolidated VIEs related to an automobile loan securitization and a solar loan securitization where it has determined that it\nis the primary beneficiary. The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets for the consolidated VIEs as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nAssets:\nOther short-term investments $ 50 55\nIndirect secured consumer loans 1,097 1,535\nSolar energy installation loans 34 38\nALLL (21) (28)\nOther assets 8 10\nTotal assets $ 1,168 1,610\nLiabilities:\nOther liabilities $ 13 14\nLong-term debt 1,008 1,409\nTotal liabilities $ 1,021 1,423\nIn a securitization transaction that occurred in August of 2023, the Bancorp transferred $1.74 billion in aggregate automobile loans to a\nbankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. This trust then issued approximately $1.58 billion of asset-backed notes, of which\napproximately $79 million were retained by the Bancorp. Additionally, as a result of a previous business acquisition, the Bancorp acquired\ninterests in a completed securitization transaction in which solar energy installation loans were transferred to a bankruptcy remote trust which\nwas deemed to be a VIE.\nIn each of these securitization transactions, the primary purposes of the VIEs were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of\ncredit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide access to liquidity for originated loans. The Bancorp\nretained residual interests in the VIEs and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the VIEs that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIEs. In addition, the Bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds\nthe power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. As a result, the Bancorp\nconcluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of the VIEs are restricted to the\nsettlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIEs. The third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have\nrecourse to the general assets of the Bancorp.\nThe economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The principal risks to\nwhich the VIEs are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. The credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit\nenhancements in the form of reserve accounts, over-collateralization, excess interest on the loans and the subordination of certain classes of\nasset-backed securities to other classes.\n93\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNon-consolidated VIEs\nThe following tables provide a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to non-\nconsolidated VIEs for which the Bancorp holds an interest, but is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as well as the Bancorp’s maximum\nexposure to losses associated with its interests in the entities as of:\nTotal Total Maximum\nSeptember 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Assets Liabilities Exposure\nCDC investments $ 2,136 751 2,178\nPrivate equity investments 268 — 484\nLoans provided to VIEs 4,411 — 6,883\nLease pool entities 33 — 33\nSolar loan securitizations 8 — 8\nTotal Total Maximum\nDecember 31, 2023 ($ in millions) Assets Liabilities Exposure\nCDC investments $ 2,007 690 2,054\nPrivate equity investments 230 — 400\nLoans provided to VIEs 4,274 — 6,395\nLease pool entities 42 — 42\nSolar loan securitizations 9 — 9\nCDC investments\nCDC invests in projects to create affordable housing and revitalize business and residential areas. CDC generally co-invests with other\nunrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the property under development.\nThe entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and LLCs and CDC typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form\nof equity contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by the performance of their underlying investment projects as well\nas the VIEs’ ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity\ninvestments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it lacks the power to direct the activities\nthat most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the VIEs’ ability to operate in compliance with the rules\nand regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the managing members\nwho exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs. For information regarding the Bancorp’s accounting for these\ninvestments, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Bancorp’s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity\ncontributions. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of the\ninvestments, including the unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. Certain CDC investments include\nundrawn liquidity and lending commitments which are included in the maximum exposure amount but not included in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would\nexpose the Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a level of projected\ntax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the Bancorp’s risk.\nThe Bancorp utilizes the proportional amortization method to account for its qualifying investments in projects that are related to certain\nincome tax credit programs. Effective with the adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, these tax credit programs include the LIHTC\nprogram established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC and the\nRehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1,\n2024, the Bancorp utilized the proportional amortization method for its LIHTC investments but other tax credit program investments were\naccounted for under the equity method.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp’s CDC investments included $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of\ninvestments in tax credit programs for which the Bancorp had elected to apply the proportional amortization method. The unfunded\ncommitments related to these investments were $751 million and $684 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be funded from 2024 to 2040.\n94\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes the impacts to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to these investments:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nCondensed Consolidated September 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) Statements of Income Caption(a) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProportional amortization Applicable income tax expense $ 50 47 150 148\nTax credits and other benefits(b) Applicable income tax expense (67) (60) (190) (178)\nChanges in carrying amounts of equity method\ninvestments(c) Other noninterest expense 2 — 6 —\n(a) The Bancorp did not recognize impairment losses resulting from the forfeiture or ineligibility of tax credits or other circumstances during both the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(b) The related cash flows are classified as operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily in net change in other assets.\n(c) These amounts pertain to tax credit program investments which were accounted for under the equity method as they did not meet the qualification criteria for the\nproportional amortization method.\nPrivate equity investments\nThe Bancorp invests as a limited partner in private equity investment funds which provide the Bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates\nof return on invested capital, while also providing strategic opportunities in certain cases. Each of the limited partnerships has an unrelated\nthird-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. The Bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these\nprivate equity investments. The funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners’ capital contributions and investment returns.\nThe Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not have the obligation to absorb the funds’\nexpected losses or the right to receive the funds’ expected residual returns that could potentially be significant to the funds and lacks the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the funds. The Bancorp, as a limited partner, does\nnot have substantive participating or substantive kick-out rights over the general partner. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts for its investments\nin these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting.\nThe Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from the negative performance of the underlying investments in the private equity investment funds.\nAs a limited partner, the Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded\ncommitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets,\nare presented in previous tables. Also, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp’s unfunded commitment amounts to the\nprivate equity funds were $216 million and $170 million, respectively. As part of previous commitments, the Bancorp made capital\ncontributions to private equity investments of $13 million and $15 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $38 million and $36 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLoans provided to VIEs\nThe Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to finance\ncertain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from\nthe Bancorp or a syndication through which the Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities is responsible for servicing the\nunderlying assets in the VIEs. Because the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the\nestablishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures, the Bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary.\nThe principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss\nis equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp’s outstanding loans to these VIEs are\nincluded in commercial loans in Note 5. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp’s unfunded commitments to these\nentities were $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The loans and unfunded commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp’s\noverall analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit\nliquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs.\nLease pool entities\nThe Bancorp is a co-investor with other unrelated leasing companies in three LLCs designed for the purpose of purchasing pools of residual\ninterests in leases which have been originated or purchased by the other investing member. For each LLC, the leasing company is the\nmanaging member and has full authority over the day-to-day operations of the entity. While the Bancorp holds more than 50% of the equity\ninterests in each LLC, the operating agreements require both members to consent to significant corporate actions, such as liquidating the\nentity or removing the manager. In addition, the Bancorp has a preference with regards to distributions such that all of the Bancorp’s equity\ncontribution for each pool must be distributed, plus a pre-defined rate of return, before the other member may receive distributions. The\nleasing company is also entitled to the return of its investment plus a pre-defined rate of return before any residual profits are distributed to\nthe members.\nThe lease pool entities are primarily subject to risk of losses on the lease residuals purchased. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss is\nequal to the carrying amount of the investments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it\n95\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\ndoes not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities. This power is held by\nthe leasing company, who as managing member controls the servicing of the leases and collection of the proceeds on the residual interests.\nSolar loan securitizations\nAs a result of a previous business acquisition, the Bancorp acquired interests in completed securitization transactions in which solar energy\ninstallation loans were transferred to bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be VIEs. In each of these securitization transactions, the\nprimary purposes of the VIEs were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well\nas residual interests, and to provide access to liquidity for originated loans. The Bancorp retained certain risk retention interests in the classes\nof securities issued by the VIEs and retained servicing rights for the underlying loans. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss is equal to\nthe carrying amount of the investments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because it does not\nhave the obligation to absorb the VIEs expected losses or the right to receive the VIEs expected residual returns that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs. The risk retention interests held by the Bancorp were included in available-for-sale debt and other securities in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n96\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n13. Sales of Receivables and Servicing Rights\nResidential Mortgage Loan Sales\nThe Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIn those sales, the Bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and provided certain standard representations and warranties; however, the\ninvestors have no recourse to the Bancorp’s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorp receives servicing fees based on\na percentage of the outstanding balance. The Bancorp identifies classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest rates.\nInformation related to residential mortgage loan sales and the Bancorp’s mortgage banking activity, which is included in mortgage banking\nnet revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, is as follows:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nResidential mortgage loan sales(a) $ 1,327 1,374 2,802 3,882\nOrigination fees and gains on loan sales 18 19 50 59\nGross mortgage servicing fees 77 79 233 241\n(a) Represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of the sale.\nServicing Rights\nThe Bancorp measures all of its mortgage servicing rights at fair value with changes in fair value reported in mortgage banking net revenue in\nthe Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents changes in the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans for the nine months ended September 30:\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 1,737 1,746\nServicing rights originated 36 57\nServicing rights purchased — 25\nServicing rights sold (5) —\nChanges in fair value:\nDue to changes in inputs or assumptions(a) 1 107\nOther changes in fair value(b) (113) (113)\nBalance, end of period $ 1,656 1,822\n(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates.\n(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time.\nThe Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSR\nportfolio. This strategy may include the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various available-for-sale debt and trading debt securities.\nThe interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to\neconomically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR portfolio caused by fluctuating OAS, earnings rates and prepayment speeds.\nThe fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\nThe following table presents activity related to valuations of the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChanges in fair value and settlement of free-standing derivatives\npurchased to economically hedge the MSR portfolio(a) $ 45 (75) (17) (110)\nMSR fair value adjustment due to changes in inputs or assumptions(a) (49) 73 1 107\n(a) Included in mortgage banking net revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\n97\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe key economic assumptions used in measuring the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that continued to be held by the\nBancorp at the date of sale, securitization or purchase resulting from transactions completed during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted- Prepayment Weighted- Prepayment\nAverage Life Speed OAS Average Life Speed OAS\n(in years) (annual) (bps) (in years) (annual) (bps)\nFixed-rate 5.8 15.4 % 494 6.6 12.2 % 575\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp serviced $95.8 billion and $100.8 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage\nloans for other investors. The value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Bancorp is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on\nthe sold financial assets. The weighted-average coupon of the MSR portfolio was 3.78% and 3.72% at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2024, the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse changes in\nprepayment speed assumptions and immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in OAS for servicing rights related to residential mortgage\nloans are as follows:\nPrepayment OAS\nSpeed Assumption Assumption\nImpact of Adverse Change Impact of Adverse\nWeighted-\non Fair Value Change on Fair Value\nAverage Life OAS\n($ in millions)(a) Fair Value (in years) Rate 10% 20% 50% (bps) 10% 20%\nFixed-rate $ 1,653 8.4 6.7 % $ (37) (74) (175) 470 $ (35) (69)\nAdjustable-rate 3 3.9 22.0 — — (1) 696 — —\n(a) The impact of the weighted-average default rate on the current fair value of residual cash flows for all scenarios is immaterial.\nThese sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these variations in\nthe assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be\nlinear. The Bancorp believes that variations of these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key\nassumptions could be even greater. Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the\ninterests that continue to be held by the Bancorp is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may\nresult in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or\ncounteract these sensitivities.\n98\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n14. Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related\nto interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. Additionally, the Bancorp holds derivative instruments for the benefit of its\ncommercial customers and for other business purposes. The Bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative derivative positions.\nThe Bancorp’s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that\nchanges in interest rates do not adversely affect the Bancorp’s net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp\nmay use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward\ncontracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest\npayments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated notional amount and maturity date. Interest rate floors\nprotect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer\nagrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Options provide\nthe purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price.\nSwaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap.\nPrepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. The Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors,\nmortgage options, TBA securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. Principal-only swaps are total return\nswaps based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust. TBA securities are a forward purchase agreement for a\nmortgage-backed securities trade whereby the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made.\nForeign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. Derivative instruments that the\nBancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts.\nThe Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate contracts) for\nthe benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes. The Bancorp economically hedges significant exposures related to these\nfree-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable and independent counterparties with\nsubstantially matching terms and currencies. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their\ncontracts. The Bancorp’s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts.\nCredit risk is minimized through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master netting\narrangements. Derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nwhile derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash\ncollateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts with\nthe exception of certain variation margin payments that are considered legal settlements of the derivative contracts. For derivative contracts\ncleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the variation\nmargin payments are applied to net the fair value of the respective derivative contracts.\nThe Bancorp’s derivative contracts include certain contractual features in which either the Bancorp or the counterparties may be required to\nprovide collateral, typically in the form of cash or securities, as initial margin and to offset changes in the fair value of the derivatives,\nincluding changes in the fair value due to credit risk, either of the Bancorp or the counterparty. In measuring the fair value of its derivative\ncontracts, the Bancorp considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral maintenance requirements of certain derivative\ncounterparties and the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require collateral maintenance.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of collateral held by the Bancorp for derivative assets was $728 million and\n$1.3 billion, respectively. For derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties whose rules treat variation margin payments\nas settlements of the derivative contract, the payments for variation margin of $437 million and $587 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, were applied to reduce the respective derivative contracts and were also not included in the total amount of\ncollateral held. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the credit component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative\nassets associated with customer accommodation contracts was $8 million and $7 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of collateral posted by the Bancorp, as either initial margin or due to changes\nin fair value of the related derivative contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, $437 million and $721 million, respectively, of variation margin payments were applied to the respective derivative\ncontracts to reduce the Bancorp’s derivative liabilities and were also not included in the total amount of collateral posted. Certain of the\nBancorp’s derivative liabilities contain credit risk-related contingent features that could result in the requirement to post additional collateral\nupon the occurrence of specified events. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the additional collateral\nthat could be required to be posted as a result of the credit risk-related contingent features being triggered was immaterial to the Bancorp’s\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for further consideration of\n99\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\ncredit risk. As a result, the Bancorp determined that the impact of the Bancorp’s credit risk to the valuation of its derivative liabilities was\nimmaterial to the Bancorp’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as either fair value hedges or\ncash flow hedges. Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which hedge accounting is not\nestablished, are held as free-standing derivatives. All customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing derivatives.\nThe following tables reflect the notional amounts and fair values for all derivative instruments included in the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as of:\nFair Value\nNotional Derivative Derivative\nSeptember 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Amount Assets Liabilities\nDerivatives Designated as Qualifying Hedging Instruments:\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate swaps related to long-term debt $ 5,955 — 27\nTotal fair value hedges — 27\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate floors related to C&I loans 3,000 — —\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans 8,000 — 10\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans - forward starting(a) 4,000 — —\nInterest rate swaps related to commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans -\nforward starting(a) 4,000 — —\nTotal cash flow hedges — 10\nTotal derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments — 37\nDerivatives Not Designated as Qualifying Hedging Instruments:\nFree-standing derivatives – risk management and other business purposes:\nInterest rate contracts related to MSR portfolio 3,505 11 1\nForward contracts related to residential mortgage loans measured at fair value(b) 1,040 1 4\nSwap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

Decisions to enter into these interest rate swaps are made\nprimarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify for the shortcut method of accounting that permits the\nassumption of perfect offset. For all designated fair value hedges of interest rate risk as of September 30, 2024 that were not accounted for\nunder the shortcut method of accounting, the Bancorp performed an assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis with changes\nin the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk\nrecorded in the same income statement line in current period net income.\n101\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following table reflects the changes in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges and the changes in fair value of\nthe related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, as well as the line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income\nin which the corresponding gains or losses are recorded:\nCondensed Consolidated For the three months ended For the nine months ended\nStatements of September 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) Income Caption 2024 2023 2024 2023\nLong-term debt:\nChange in fair value of interest rate swaps hedging\nlong-term debt Interest on long-term debt $ 190 (147) 76 (186)\nChange in fair value of hedged long-term debt\nattributable to the risk being hedged Interest on long-term debt (190) 146 (76) 188\nThe following amounts were recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value\nhedges as of:\nCondensed Consolidated September 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) Balance Sheets Caption 2024 2023\nLong-term debt:\nCarrying amount of the hedged items Long-term debt $ 5,977 5,899\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included\nin the carrying amount of the hedged items Long-term debt 38 (38)\nAvailable-for-sale debt and other securities:\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments remaining\nfor hedged items for which hedge accounting has been\ndiscontinued Available-for-sale debt and other securities (10) (11)\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted\ntransactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in\ncircumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the Bancorp desires to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps\nand floors to limit cash flow variability of floating-rate assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, all hedges designated as cash flow\nhedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. The entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI and reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings when the hedged item affects\nearnings. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future\ncash flows is 88 months.\nReclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial loans are recorded within interest income in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, $186 million and $372 million of net\ndeferred losses, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in AOCI in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30,\n2024, $111 million in net unrealized losses, net of tax, recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12\nmonths. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nDuring both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no gains or losses reclassified from AOCI into\nearnings associated with the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no\nlonger occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents the pre-tax net (losses) gains recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and in the\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmount of pre-tax net (losses) gains recognized in OCI $ 530 (687) (29) (864)\nAmount of pre-tax net losses reclassified from OCI into net income (91) (94) (270) (240)\nFree-Standing Derivative Instruments – Risk Management and Other Business Purposes\nAs part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-standing\nderivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBA securities and interest rate swaps) to\neconomically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the spread between mortgage\n102\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nrates and benchmark rates because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. Principal-only swaps also provide\nprepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a faster prepayment\nenvironment. Receive-fixed/pay-floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as\nexpected.\nThe Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the changes in fair value of certain residential\nmortgage loans held for sale and certain residential mortgage portfolio loans measured at fair value which are due to changes in interest rates.\nThese contracts generally settle within one year or less. IRLCs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for sale are\nalso considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily\nwith forward contracts. Revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a\ncomponent of mortgage banking net revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn conjunction with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares in 2009, the Bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make\nor receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. This total return swap is\naccounted for as a free-standing derivative. Refer to Note 23 for more information about significant inputs and assumptions used in the\nvaluation of this instrument.\nThe Bancorp entered into certain interest rate swap contracts for the purpose of managing its collateral positions across two central clearing\nparties. These interest rate swaps were perfectly offsetting positions that allowed the Bancorp to lower the cash posted as required initial\nmargin at the clearing parties, which reduced its credit exposure to the clearing parties. Given that all relevant terms for these interest rate\nswaps are offsetting, these trades create no additional market risk for the Bancorp.\nAs part of the LIBOR to SOFR transition, the Bancorp received certain interest rate swap contracts from the two central clearing parties that\nhave moved from an Effective Federal Funds Rate discounting curve to a SOFR discounting curve. The purpose of these interest rate swaps\nwas to neutralize the impact on collateral requirements due to the change in discounting curves implemented by the central clearing parties.\nThe net (losses) gains recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing derivative instruments used for\nrisk management and other business purposes are summarized in the following table:\nCondensed Consolidated For the three months ended For the nine months ended\nStatements of September 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) Income Caption 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts:\nInterest rate contracts related to MSR portfolio Mortgage banking net revenue $ 45 (75) (17) (110)\nForward contracts related to residential mortgage\nloans measured at fair value Mortgage banking net revenue (7) 6 (1) 9\nInterest-only strips Other noninterest income — — — (3)\nForeign exchange contracts:\nForeign exchange contracts for risk management\npurposes Other noninterest income (1) 5 5 1\nEquity contracts:\nSwap associated with sale of Visa, Inc. Class B\nShares Other noninterest income (47) (10) (87) (72)\nFree-Standing Derivative Instruments – Customer Accommodation\nThe majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. These\nderivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted\ntransactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into\nfor the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, commodity\ncontracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant\nexposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved,\nreputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial\ncustomer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign\nexchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of commercial banking revenue or\nother noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the Bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying\ninterest rate derivative contracts. The Bancorp typically only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the Bancorp\nhas participated in the loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. The Bancorp will make payments\nunder these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract.\n103\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe total notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $5 million and $6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the risk participation\nagreements had a weighted-average remaining life of 2.2 years.\nThe Bancorp’s maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate\nderivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers\nin the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease\nportfolio.\nRisk ratings of the notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nPass $ 3,026 3,168\nSpecial mention 149 323\nSubstandard 95 72\nTotal $ 3,270 3,563\nThe net gains (losses) recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing derivative instruments used for\ncustomer accommodation are summarized in the following table:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nCondensed Consolidated\n($ in millions) Statements of Income Caption 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts:\nInterest rate contracts for customers (contract\nrevenue) Commercial banking revenue $ 9 5 20 26\nInterest rate contracts for customers (credit portion\nof fair value adjustment) Other noninterest expense (4) 4 — 2\nInterest rate lock commitments Mortgage banking net revenue 17 7 37 33\nCommodity contracts:\nCommodity contracts for customers (contract\nrevenue) Commercial banking revenue 3 9 11 30\nCommodity contracts for customers (credit portion\nof fair value adjustment) Other noninterest expense — 1 1 —\nForeign exchange contracts:\nForeign exchange contracts for customers (contract\nrevenue) Commercial banking revenue 18 24 57 67\nForeign exchange contracts for customers (contract\nrevenue) Other noninterest income (16) 7 (13) —\nForeign exchange contracts for customers (credit\nportion of fair value adjustment) Other noninterest expense — 1 — 3\nOffsetting Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Bancorp’s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include\nprovisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. When the Bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative\ntransaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the\nright to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting\ntransactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office. The Bancorp’s policy is to present its\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for\nsetoff are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat\nvariation margin payments as settlements, the fair value of the respective derivative contracts is reported net of the variation margin\npayments.\nCollateral amounts included in the tables below consist primarily of cash and highly rated government-backed securities and do not include\nvariation margin payments for derivative contracts with legal rights of setoff for both periods shown.\n104\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following table provides a summary of offsetting derivative financial instruments:\nGross Amount Gross Amounts Not Offset in the\nRecognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance\nCondensed Consolidated Sheets\nBalance Sheets(a) Derivatives Collateral(b) Net Amount\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDerivative assets $ 2,092 (1,178) (251) 663\nDerivative liabilities 2,427 (1,178) (231) 1,018\nAs of December 31, 2023\nDerivative assets $ 2,672 (1,031) (877) 764\nDerivative liabilities 2,999 (1,031) (159) 1,809\n(a) Amount does not include IRLCs because these instruments are not subject to master netting or similar arrangements.\n(b) Amount of collateral received as an offset to asset positions or pledged as an offset to liability positions.

Other Short-Term Borrowings\nBorrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. The following table presents a summary of the Bancorp’s\nother short-term borrowings as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nFHLB advances $ 1,000 2,500\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements 321 330\nDerivative collateral 57 3\nOther borrowed money 46 28\nTotal other short-term borrowings $ 1,424 2,861\nThe Bancorp’s securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and are collateralized by securities\nincluded in available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These\nsecurities are subject to changes in market value and, therefore, the Bancorp may increase or decrease the level of securities pledged as\ncollateral based upon these movements in market value. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all securities sold under\nrepurchase agreements were secured by agency mortgage-backed securities and the repurchase agreements had an overnight remaining\ncontractual maturity.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp’s other borrowed money primarily included obligations recognized by the\nBancorp under ASC Topic 860 related to certain loans sold to GNMA and serviced by the Bancorp. Under ASC Topic 860, once the Bancorp\nhas the unilateral right to repurchase the GNMA loans due to the borrower missing three consecutive payments, the Bancorp is considered to\nhave regained effective control over the loan. As such, the Bancorp is required to recognize both the loan and the repurchase liability,\nregardless of the intent to repurchase the loans.\n16. Long-Term Debt\nOn January 29, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.0 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on January 29, 2032.\nThe senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.631% per annum to, but excluding, January 29, 2031. From, and including, January 29, 2031\nuntil, but excluding January 29, 2032, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.840%. The senior notes are\nredeemable in whole one year prior to their maturity date, or in whole or in part beginning 60 days prior to maturity, at par plus accrued and\nunpaid interest. Additionally, the senior notes are redeemable at the Bancorp’s option, in whole or in part, beginning 180 days after the issue\ndate and prior to January 29, 2031, at the greater of: (a) the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, or (b) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest.\nOn September 6, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $750 million of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on September 6,\n2030. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.895% per annum to, but excluding, September 6, 2029. From, and including, September\n6, 2029 until, but excluding, September 6, 2030, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.486%. The senior\nnotes are redeemable in whole one year prior to their maturity date, or in whole or in part beginning 30 days prior to maturity, at par plus\naccrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, the senior notes are redeemable at the Bancorp’s option, in whole or in part, beginning 180 days\nafter the issue date and prior to September 6, 2029, at the greater of: (a) the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, or (b) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest.\n106\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n17. Capital Actions\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Transactions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of\nthese transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based on a\ndiscount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp’s common stock during the respective terms of each repurchase\nagreement. Each accelerated share repurchase was treated as two separate transactions, (i) the repurchase of treasury shares on the repurchase\ndate and (ii) a forward contract indexed to the Bancorp’s common stock.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Bancorp’s accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into and settled during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nShares Received from\nAmount Shares Repurchased Forward Contract Total Shares\nRepurchase Date ($ in millions) on Repurchase Date Settlement Repurchased Final Settlement Date\nJune 12, 2024 $ 125 3,011,621 496,767 3,508,388 June 27, 2024\nJuly 23, 2024 200 4,160,548 713,340 4,873,888 August 5, 2024\nFor further information on a subsequent event related to capital actions, refer to Note 25.\n18. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees\nThe Bancorp, in the normal course of business, enters into financial instruments and various agreements to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. The Bancorp also enters into certain transactions and agreements to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks, provide\nfunding, equipment and locations for its operations and invest in its communities. These instruments and agreements involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The creditworthiness of counterparties for all instruments and agreements is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance\nwith the Bancorp’s credit policies. The Bancorp’s significant commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees in excess of the amounts\nrecognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are discussed in the following sections.\nCommitments\nThe Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts. The following table reflects a summary of significant\ncommitments as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nCommitments to extend credit $ 80,299 81,570\nLetters of credit 1,998 2,095\nForward contracts related to residential mortgage loans measured at fair value 1,040 650\nCapital commitments for private equity investments 216 170\nCapital expenditures 100 95\nPurchase obligations 36 69\nCommitments to extend credit\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require\npayment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do\nnot necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the\ncounterparty for the amount of the contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest\nrates and the Bancorp’s exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the Bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $138 million and $166 million, respectively,\nincluded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with\ncommitments to extend credit using the same standard regulatory risk rating systems utilized for its loan and lease portfolio.\n107\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nRisk ratings of outstanding commitments to extend credit under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nPass $ 78,274 79,593\nSpecial mention 836 1,301\nSubstandard 1,188 676\nDoubtful 1 —\nTotal commitments to extend credit $ 80,299 81,570\nLetters of credit\nStandby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and\nexpire as summarized in the following table as of September 30, 2024:\n($ in millions)\nLess than 1 year(a) $ 688\n1 - 5 years(a) 1,270\nOver 5 years 40\nTotal letters of credit $ 1,998\n(a) Includes $1 and $2 issued on behalf of commercial customers to facilitate trade payments in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies which expire in less than 1 year\nand between 1 - 5 years, respectively.\nStandby letters of credit accounted for approximately 99% of total letters of credit at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and\nare considered guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Approximately 75% and 72% of the total standby letters of credit were\ncollateralized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event of nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp\nhas rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and\nmarketable securities. The reserve related to these standby letters of credit, which was included in the total reserve for unfunded\ncommitments, was $15 million and $20 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bancorp monitors the credit\nrisk associated with letters of credit using the same standard regulatory risk rating systems utilized for its loan and lease portfolio.\nRisk ratings of outstanding letters of credit under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nPass $ 1,798 1,902\nSpecial mention 75 81\nSubstandard 122 112\nDoubtful 3 —\nTotal letters of credit $ 1,998 2,095\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as\nVRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the\nVRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. The VRDNs\ngenerally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. When the\nVRDNs are tendered, a remarketing agent generally finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to keep the securities outstanding in the\nmarket. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total VRDNs, of which FTS was the remarketing agent for all, were $365 million\nand $400 million, respectively. As remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for actively remarketing VRDNs to other investors when they have\nbeen tendered. If another investor is not identified, FTS may choose to purchase the VRDNs into inventory at its discretion while it continues\nto remarket them. If FTS purchases the VRDNs into inventory, it can subsequently tender back the VRDNs to the issuer’s trustee with proper\nadvance notice. The Bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $53 million and $83 million of the VRDNs remarketed by\nFTS at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance\nprovided in the previous tables. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount and $6 million of these VRDNs in its portfolio and classified them\nas trading debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nForward contracts related to residential mortgage loans measured at fair value\nThe Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential\nmortgage loans held for sale, and certain residential mortgage portfolio loans measured at fair value, due to changes in interest rates. The\noutstanding notional amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of significant commitments table for all periods\npresented.\n108\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nOther commitments\nThe Bancorp has entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or\nservices.\nContingent Liabilities\nLegal claims\nThere are legal claims pending against the Bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 19 for\nadditional information regarding these proceedings.\nGuarantees\nThe Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual\narrangements as discussed in the following sections.\nResidential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions\nConforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. A\ncontractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from\nthe breach. The Bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan, or indemnify or make whole the investor or insurer for\nwhich the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. For more information on how the\nBancorp establishes the residential mortgage repurchase reserve, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp maintained reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty\nprovisions totaling $6 million and $7 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Bancorp uses the best information available when estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve; however, the estimation\nprocess is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts reserved as of September 30, 2024 are\nreasonably possible. The Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation\nand warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately $9 million in excess of amounts reserved. This estimate was derived by modifying\nthe key assumptions to reflect management’s judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. The actual\nrepurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably\npossible losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those previously discussed.\nDuring both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp paid an immaterial amount in the form of make-whole\npayments and repurchased $2 million and $13 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. For both the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp paid an immaterial amount in the form of make-whole payments and\nrepurchased $17 million and $46 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total repurchase demand\nrequests during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $8 million and $16 million, respectively. Total repurchase\ndemand requests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $36 million and $76 million, respectively. Total\noutstanding repurchase demand inventory was $7 million and $8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nMargin accounts\nFTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage\nclearing agent for the benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage,\ncost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The\nmargin account balances held by the brokerage clearing agent were $13 million and $6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. In the event of customer default, FTS has rights to the underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the\nunderlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the Bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin\naccounts.\nLong-term borrowing obligations\nThe Bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities\nof $62 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nVisa litigation\nThe Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa’s reorganization and IPO (the “IPO”) of its Class A common shares (the “Class A\nShares”) in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with its\nmembership agreements. In accordance with Visa’s bylaws prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could have been required to indemnify Visa for the\nBancorp’s proportional share of losses based on the pre-IPO membership interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the Bancorp’s\nindemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known or anticipated litigation (the “Covered Litigation”) as of the date of\n109\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nthe restructuring. This modification triggered a requirement for the Bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the\nindemnification liability.\nIn conjunction with the IPO, the Bancorp received 10.1 million of Visa’s Class B common shares (the “Class B Shares”) based on the\nBancorp’s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO. The Class B Shares were not transferable (other than to another member bank)\nuntil the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or the date on which the Covered Litigation has been resolved; therefore, the\nBancorp’s Class B Shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. Visa deposited $3 billion of the\nproceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered\nLitigation. Since then, when Visa’s litigation committee determined that the escrow account was insufficient, Visa issued additional Class A\nShares and deposited the proceeds from the sale of the Class A Shares into the litigation escrow account. When Visa funded the litigation\nescrow account, the Class B Shares were subjected to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of Class B Shares into Class A\nShares. On January 23, 2024, Visa announced shareholder approval of changes to its articles of incorporation that would release certain\ntransfer restrictions on portions of Class B Shares. The program will allow holders of Class B Shares to liquidate some of their shares subject\nto assurances that other Visa stockholders will retain existing protection from exposure to the Covered Litigation.\nIn 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make or\nreceive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. The swap terminates on the\nlater of the third anniversary of Visa’s IPO or the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. Refer to Note 23 for additional information\non the valuation of the swap. The counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B Shares will be impacted by dilutive\nadjustments to the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares caused by any Covered Litigation losses in excess of the\nlitigation escrow account. If actual judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation significantly exceed current expectations, then\nadditional funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the Class B Shares could result in a scenario where\nthe Bancorp’s ultimate exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the “Visa Litigation Exposure”) exceeds the value of the Class B\nShares owned by the swap counterparty (the “Class B Value”). In the event the Bancorp concludes that it is probable that the Visa Litigation\nExposure exceeds the Class B Value, the Bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other noninterest\nexpense for the amount of the excess. Any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative\nliability associated with the total return swap.\nAs of the date of the Bancorp’s sale of the Visa Class B Shares and through September 30, 2024, the Bancorp has concluded that it is not\nprobable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class B Value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of Class B Shares, the\nBancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return\nswap. The fair value of the swap liability was $196 million at September 30, 2024 and $168 million at December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 14\nand Note 23 for further information.\nAfter the Bancorp’s sale of the Class B Shares, Visa has funded additional amounts into the litigation escrow account which have resulted in\nfurther dilutive adjustments to the conversion of Class B Shares into Class A Shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap,\nrequired the Bancorp to make cash payments in varying amounts to the swap counterparty as follows:\nVisa Bancorp Cash\nPeriod ($ in millions) Funding Amount Payment Amount\nQ2 2010 $ 500 20\nQ4 2010 800 35\nQ2 2011 400 19\nQ1 2012 1,565 75\nQ3 2012 150 6\nQ3 2014 450 18\nQ2 2018 600 26\nQ3 2019 300 12\nQ4 2021 250 11\nQ2 2022 600 25\nQ4 2022 350 15\nQ2 2023 500 21\nQ3 2023 150 6\nQ3 2024 1,500 (a)\n(a) The Bancorp made a cash payment of $65 million to the swap counterparty on October 23, 2024 as a result of the Visa escrow funding in the third quarter of\n2024.\n110\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n19. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\nLitigation\nVisa/MasterCard Merchant Interchange Litigation\nIn April 2006, the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against Visa®,\nMasterCard® and several other major financial institutions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (In re:\nPayment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 5-MD-1720). The plaintiffs, merchants operating\ncommercial businesses throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claimed that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were\nunreasonable and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In addition to being a named defendant, the Bancorp is currently also\nsubject to a possible indemnification obligation of Visa as discussed in Note 18 and has also entered into judgment and loss sharing\nagreements with Visa, MasterCard and certain other named defendants. In October 2012, the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement\nagreement that was initially approved by the trial court but reversed by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals and remanded to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. More than 500 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class filed separate federal lawsuits against\nVisa, MasterCard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. These individual federal lawsuits were transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. While the Bancorp is only named as a defendant in one of the individual\nfederal lawsuits, it may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted\nabove. On September 17, 2018, the defendants in the consolidated class action signed a second settlement agreement (the “Amended\nSettlement Agreement”) resolving the claims seeking monetary damages by the proposed plaintiffs’ class (the “Plaintiff Damages Class”) and\nsuperseding the original settlement agreement entered into in October 2012. The Amended Settlement Agreement included, among other\nterms, a release from participating class members for liability for claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement\nAgreement becomes final. The Amended Settlement Agreement provided for a total payment by all defendants of approximately\n$6.24 billion, composed of approximately $5.34 billion held in escrow plus an additional $900 million in new funds. Pursuant to the terms of\nthe Settlement Agreement, $700 million of the additional $900 million has been returned to the defendants due to the level of opt-outs from\nthe class. The Bancorp’s allocated share of the settlement is within existing reserves, including funds maintained in escrow. On December 13,\n2019, the Court entered an order granting final approval for the settlement, and on March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed that order.\nThe settlement does not resolve the claims of the separate proposed plaintiffs’ class seeking injunctive relief or the claims of merchants who\nhave opted out of the proposed class settlement and are pursuing, or may in the future decide to pursue, private lawsuits. On September 27,\n2021, the Court entered an order certifying a class of merchants pursuing claims for injunctive relief. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a\nmotion seeking preliminary approval of a settlement that would resolve class claims for injunctive relief. On June 13, 2024, the Court held a\nhearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the injunctive relief settlement, and on June 25, 2024, the Court issued an order\ndenying the request for preliminary approval of the settlement. The ultimate outcome in this matter, including the timing of resolution,\nremains uncertain. Refer to Note 18 for further information.\nKlopfenstein v. Fifth Third Bank\nOn August 3, 2012, William Klopfenstein and Adam McKinney filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Ohio (Klopfenstein et al. v. Fifth Third Bank), alleging that the 120% APR that Fifth Third disclosed on its Early\nAccess program was misleading. Early Access is a deposit-advance program offered to eligible customers with checking accounts. The\nplaintiffs sought to represent a nationwide class of customers who used the Early Access program and repaid their cash advances within 30\ndays. On October 31, 2012, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In 2013, four similar\nputative class action lawsuits were filed against Fifth Third Bank in federal courts throughout the country (Lori and Danielle Laskaris v. Fifth\nThird Bank, Janet Fyock v. Fifth Third Bank, Jesse McQuillen v. Fifth Third Bank, and Brian Harrison v. Fifth Third Bank). Those four\nlawsuits were transferred to the Southern District of Ohio and consolidated with the original lawsuit as In re: Fifth Third Early Access Cash\nAdvance Litigation (Case No. 1:12-CV-851). On behalf of a putative class, the plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary and statutory damages,\ninjunctive relief, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On March 30, 2015, the court dismissed all claims\nalleged in the consolidated lawsuit except a claim under the TILA. On May 28, 2019, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the\ndismissal of plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim and remanded for further proceedings. The plaintiffs’ claimed damages for the alleged breach\nof contract claim exceed $440 million, plus prejudgment interest. On March 26, 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification. On March 29, 2023, the trial court issued an order granting summary judgement on plaintiffs’ TILA claim, with statutory\ndamages capped at $2 million plus costs and attorney fees. Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract proceeded to trial beginning on April 17,\n2023. On April 27, 2023, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Bank, finding a breach of contract, but that the voluntary payment doctrine\nis a complete defense to the breach of contract claim. On September 30, 2024, the trial court issued a decision denying post-trial motions\nrelated to the jury verdict.\nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association\nOn March 9, 2020, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entitled\nCFPB v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association, Case No. 1:20-CV-1683, alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act,\nTILA, and Truth in Savings Act related to Fifth Third’s alleged opening of unspecified numbers of allegedly unauthorized credit card,\nsavings, checking, online banking and early access accounts from 2010 through 2016. The parties agreed to the entry of a Stipulated Final\nJudgment and Order on July 9, 2024 to resolve this matter, pursuant to which Fifth Third, without admitting or denying any of the allegations\nin the suit except as specified in the order, agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $15 million, agreed to maintain existing policies around\n111\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nits consumer sales incentives, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its account opening practices comply with law and the order and\nagreed to provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers with checking, savings, or credit card accounts opened beginning January 1,\n2010 and ending December 31, 2016.\nConcurrently with the Stipulated Final Judgment and Order, Fifth Third, without admitting or denying any of the findings of fact or\nconclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), has also agreed to entry of a Consent Order related to a since-discontinued program in its\nauto lending business that placed collateral protection insurance (CPI) on certain auto loans. Under the Consent Order, Fifth Third has agreed\nto pay a $5 million civil monetary penalty related to those issues, maintain existing policy changes related to its auto servicing practices,\nagreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its compliance with the order and provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers within a\nredress period beginning July 21, 2011 and ending December 31, 2020.\nHowards v. Fifth Third Bank\nOn March 8, 2018, Plaintiff Troy Howards filed a putative class action against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California (Case No. 1:18-CV-869, S.D. OH 2018), alleging that Fifth Third improperly charged certain fees related to\ninsufficient funds, customer overdrafts, and out-of-network ATM use. Venue was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiff filed claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nfor violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (Ca. Bus. & Prof. Code sec. 17200, et seq.), and the California Consumer Legal\nRemedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code sec. 1750 et seq.). Plaintiff seeks to represent putative nationwide classes and California classes of consumers\nallegedly charged improper repeated insufficient funds fees, improper overdraft fees, and fees for out-of-network ATM use from the\nbeginning of the applicable statute of limitations to present. Plaintiff seeks damages of restitution and disgorgement in the amount of the\nallegedly unlawfully charged fees, damages proved at trial together with interest as allowed by applicable law. Fifth Third filed a motion to\ndismiss all claims. On February 6, 2023, the trial court issued an order dismissing the Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim with respect to out-\nof-network ATM fees and dismissing the two claims for violations of California consumer protection statutes. The Court denied Fifth Third’s\nmotion to dismiss as it relates to the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for certain\ncustomer overdrafts and insufficient funds fees. The case is in discovery, and no trial date has been set.\nOther litigation\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation at this time. However, there are other litigation matters that\narise in the normal course of business, which include, or may include, claims related to product features, pricing and other lending practices.\nFor example, Fifth Third Bank, National Association is currently responding to lawsuits regarding bankruptcies and practices of residential\nsolar installers as well as lending practices of credit providers to this market, which includes Dividend Solar Finance, LLC, which the Bank\nacquired in May 2022. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent\nmatters, management believes that the resulting liability, if any, from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the Bancorp’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if\nunfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRecord-Keeping Investigations\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is conducting an investigation into the Bancorp’s registered swap dealer concerning\ncompliance with certain record-keeping requirements for business-related electronic communications.\nGovernmental Investigations and Proceedings\nThe Bancorp and/or its affiliates are or may become involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the\nFRB, OCC, CFPB, SEC, FINRA, U.S. Department of Justice, etc., as well as state and other governmental authorities and self-regulatory\nbodies regarding their respective businesses. For example, Fifth Third Bank, National Association is currently cooperating with investigations\nrelated to several civil investigative demands by a number of state attorneys general regarding the residential solar installation industry and\nlending practices of credit providers to this market, which includes Dividend Solar Finance, LLC, which the Bank acquired in May 2022.\nAmong these are investigations related to multiple lenders by a coalition of 17 state attorneys general relating to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nfiling of one such installer, Power Home Solar, LLC, dba Pink Energy. Dividend Solar Finance, LLC financed installations of Power Home\nSolar, LLC customers in 11 of the 17 states represented by the coalition. Additional matters will likely arise from time to time. Any of these\nmatters may result in material adverse consequences or reputational harm to the Bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors,\nofficers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other actions,\namendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp’s SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material\nweaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. Investigations by regulatory authorities may from time to time result in civil or\ncriminal referrals to law enforcement. Additionally, in some cases, regulatory authorities may take supervisory actions that are considered to\nbe confidential supervisory information which may not be publicly disclosed.\nReasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning\nmatters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are\n112\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\ninherently difficult to predict. The following factors, among others, contribute to this lack of predictability: claims often include significant\nlegal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete\nand material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of\nthe range of reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to\nthe loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accrual is\nadjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. The Bancorp also determines, when possible (due to\nthe uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts\naccrued. Under U.S. GAAP, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but\nless than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Thus, references to the upper end of\nthe range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper\nend of the range of loss for cases for which the Bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. For matters where the Bancorp is able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur\nlosses related to legal and regulatory proceedings in an aggregate amount up to approximately $74 million in excess of amounts accrued, with\nit also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. The estimates included in this amount are based on the\nBancorp’s analysis of currently available information, and as new information is obtained the Bancorp may change its estimates.\nFor these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in\nexcess of the established accrual that cannot be estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance\ncoverage and established accruals, the Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries,\nincluding the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Bancorp’s consolidated\nfinancial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if\nunfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp’s results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or\nliability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.\n20. Income Taxes\nThe applicable income tax expense was $155 million and $186 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $457 million and $519 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 21.3% and 22.0%, respectively, and 21.3% and 22.2% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWhile it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the Bancorp’s uncertain tax\npositions could increase or decrease during the next twelve months, the Bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will\nchange by a material amount during the next twelve months.\n113\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n21.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price\nthat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into\nthree broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level\n1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based\nupon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument’s fair value measurement. For more information regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables summarize assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of:\nFair

Balance Sheets.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general\nclassification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nAvailable-for-sale debt and other securities, trading debt securities and equity securities\nWhere quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities\ninclude U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing\nmodels which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 2 securities may include federal agencies\nsecurities, obligations of states and political subdivisions securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and equity securities. These securities are generally\nvalued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.\n118\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale\nFor residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon mortgage-\nbacked securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio\ncomposition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition\nincludes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the\nloan amount and the ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are\nclassified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified\nas held for sale are also classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the DCF model. These\nobservable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates.\nResidential mortgage loans\nFor residential mortgage loans for which the fair value election has been made, and that are reclassified from held for sale to held for\ninvestment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit\ncomponent. Therefore, these loans are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An adverse change in the loss rate or\nseverity assumption would result in a decrease in fair value of the related loans.\nServicing rights\nMSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available. Accordingly, the Bancorp estimates the fair value of MSRs using internal OAS models with certain\nunobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, OAS and weighted-average lives, resulting in a classification within Level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the assumptions used in the valuation of the Bancorp’s MSRs.\nDerivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified within\nLevel 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Most of the Bancorp’s derivative contracts are valued using DCF or other models that incorporate current\nmarket interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified within\nLevel 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps and\noptions. Derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters are classified within Level 3 of the\nvaluation hierarchy. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using models\ncontaining unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of a total return swap associated with the Bancorp’s sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares as\nwell as IRLCs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.\nUnder the terms of the total return swap, the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of\nthe Visa, Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares. Additionally, the Bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on Visa’s stock price and\nthe conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares until the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. The fair\nvalue of the total return swap was calculated using a DCF model based on unobservable inputs consisting of management’s estimate of the\nprobability of certain litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the Covered Litigation and Visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or\nshortfall, of the Bancorp’s proportional share of escrow funds.\nAn increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in an increase in the fair value of the\nderivative liability; conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in a\ndecrease in the fair value of the derivative liability. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Covered Litigation.\nThe net asset fair value of the Bancorp’s IRLCs at September 30, 2024 was $6 million. Immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 bps\nand 50 bps would result in increases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively. Immediate\nincreases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $3 million\nand $6 million, respectively. An immediate 10% or 20% change in loan closing rates, either adverse or favorable, would not have a material\nimpact on the fair value of IRLCs as of September 30, 2024. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes\nin fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the\nchange in fair value may not be linear.\nShort positions\nWhere quoted prices are available in an active market, short positions are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1\nsecurities include U.S. Treasury securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models\nwhich primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the valuation\nhierarchy. Level 2 securities include asset-backed and other debt securities.\n119\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe

These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.\nThe following tables provide the fair value hierarchy and carrying amount of all assets that were held as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and\nfor which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the\nrelated gains and losses from fair value adjustments on assets sold during the period as well as assets still held as of the end of the period.\nFair Value Measurements Using Total (Losses) Gains\nFor the three For the nine\nmonths ended months ended\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nCommercial loans held for sale $ — — 47 47 (1) (1)\nCommercial loans and leases — — 125 125 (73) (177)\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans — — 208 208 (7) (10)\nOREO — — 6 6 — (1)\nBank premises and equipment — — 9 9 — —\nPrivate equity investments — 3 — 3 2 11\nTotal $ — 3 395 398 (79) (178)\n122\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nFair Value Measurements Using Total Losses\nFor the three For the nine\nmonths ended months ended\nAs of September 30, 2023 ($ in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total September 30, 2023 September 30, 2023\nCommercial loans and leases $ — — 154 154 (21) (118)\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans — — 188 188 (2) (10)\nOREO — — 18 18 (7) (8)\nBank premises and equipment — — 4 4 — (2)\nPrivate equity investments — — — — — (2)\nTotal $ — — 364 364 (30) (140)\nThe following tables present information as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 about significant unobservable inputs related to the Bancorp’s\nmaterial categories of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis:\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions)\nRanges of Weighted-\nFinancial Instrument Fair Value Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Inputs Average\nCommercial loans held for sale $ 47 Comparable company analysis Market comparable transactions NM NM\nCommercial loans and leases 125 Appraised value Collateral value NM NM\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans 208 Appraised value Collateral value NM NM\nOREO 6 Appraised value Appraised value NM NM\nBank premises and equipment 9 Appraised value Appraised value NM NM\nPrivate equity investments — Comparable company analysis Market comparable transactions NM NM\nAs of September 30, 2023 ($ in millions)\nRanges of Weighted-\nFinancial Instrument Fair Value Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Inputs Average\nCommercial loans and leases $ 154 Appraised value Collateral value NM NM\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans 188 Appraised value Collateral value NM NM\nOREO 18 Appraised value Appraised value NM NM\nBank premises and equipment 4 Appraised value Appraised value NM NM\nPrivate equity investments — Comparable company analysis Market comparable transactions NM NM\nCommercial loans held for sale\nThe Bancorp estimated the fair value of certain commercial loans held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. These valuations were primarily based on applying unobservable inputs such as an estimated market discount to the unpaid\nprincipal balance of the loans (Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy).\nPortfolio loans and leases\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain collateral-\ndependent portfolio loans and leases. When a loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value less\ncost to sell of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nIn cases where the amortized cost basis of the loan or lease exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the collateral, then an ALLL is\nrecognized, or a charge-off once the remaining amount is considered uncollectible.\nOREO\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial\nand residential real estate properties and branch-related real estate no longer intended to be used for banking purposes classified as OREO and\nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. These nonrecurring losses were primarily due to declines in real estate values of the\nproperties upon the transfer, or subsequent to the transfer, to OREO. The fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of the property\nvalues, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less\ncosts to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. The previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the\nestimated costs to sell.\nBank premises and equipment\nThe Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their\ncarrying values may not be recoverable. These properties were written down to their lower of cost or market values. At least annually\nthereafter, the Bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. The fair value amounts were generally based on appraisals of the\n123\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nproperty values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information on bank premises and\nequipment, refer to Note 7.\nPrivate equity investments\nThe Bancorp accounts for its private equity investments using the measurement alternative to fair value, except for those accounted for under\nthe equity method of accounting. Under the measurement alternative, the Bancorp carries each investment at its cost basis minus impairment,\nif any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same\nissuer. The Bancorp recognized gains of $2 million and $11 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and did not recognize gains during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from observable price\nchanges. The carrying value of the Bancorp’s private equity investments still held as of September 30, 2024 includes a cumulative\n$20 million of positive adjustments as a result of observable price changes since January 1, 2018. Because these adjustments are based on\nobservable transactions in inactive markets, they are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFor private equity investments which are accounted for using the measurement alternative to fair value, the Bancorp qualitatively evaluates\neach investment quarterly to determine if impairment may exist. If necessary, the Bancorp then measures impairment by estimating the value\nof its investment and comparing that to the investment’s carrying value, whether or not the Bancorp considers the impairment to be\ntemporary. These valuations are typically developed using a DCF method, but other methods may be used if more appropriate for the\ncircumstances. These valuations are based on unobservable inputs and therefore are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For both\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Bancorp did not recognize\nimpairment charges on its private equity investments. The Bancorp recognized $2 million of impairment charges during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The carrying value of the Bancorp’s private equity investments still held as of September 30, 2024 includes a\ncumulative $15 million of impairment charges recognized since adoption of the measurement alternative to fair value on January 1, 2018.\nFair Value Option\nThe Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. GAAP.\nElecting to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the\nvalue of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Management’s intent to sell\nresidential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets\nor changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment\nand maintained in the Bancorp’s loan portfolio. In such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value.\nFair value changes recognized in earnings for residential mortgage loans held at September 30, 2024 and 2023 for which the fair value option\nwas elected, as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying IRLCs, included gains of $2 million and losses of $24 million, respectively.\nThese changes are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nValuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the\nfair value of those loans by an immaterial amount at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest on loans measured at fair\nvalue is accrued as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance for residential mortgage loans\nmeasured at fair value as of:\nAggregate Aggregate Unpaid\nSeptember 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Fair Value Principal Balance Difference\nResidential mortgage loans measured at fair value $ 626 624 2\nPast due loans of 30-89 days 1 1 —\nNonaccrual loans 1 1 —\nDecember 31, 2023\nResidential mortgage loans measured at fair value $ 450 456 (6)\nPast due loans of 30-89 days 1 1 —\nNonaccrual loans 2 2 —\n124\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nFair Value of Certain Financial Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the carrying amounts and estimated fair values for certain financial instruments, excluding financial\ninstruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nNet Carrying Fair Value Measurements Using Total\nAs of September 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 3,215 3,215 — — 3,215\nOther short-term investments 21,729 21,729 — — 21,729\nOther securities 777 — 777 — 777\nHeld-to-maturity securities 11,358 2,379 9,173 2 11,554\nLoans and leases held for sale 100 — — 100 100\nPortfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial loans and leases 70,025 — — 70,529 70,529\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans 44,224 — — 42,190 42,190\nTotal portfolio loans and leases, net $ 114,249 — — 112,719 112,719\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 168,340 — 168,319 — 168,319\nFederal funds purchased 169 169 — — 169\nOther short-term borrowings 1,424 — 1,429 — 1,429\nLong-term debt 17,058 13,979 3,452 — 17,431\nNet Carrying Fair Value Measurements Using Total\nAs of December 31, 2023 ($ in millions) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 3,142 3,142 — — 3,142\nOther short-term investments 22,082 22,082 — — 22,082\nOther securities 722 — 722 — 722\nHeld-to-maturity securities 2 — — 2 2\nLoans and leases held for sale 44 — — 44 44\nPortfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial loans and leases 71,616 — — 71,766 71,766\nConsumer and residential mortgage loans 43,180 — — 41,410 41,410\nTotal portfolio loans and leases, net $ 114,796 — — 113,176 113,176\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 168,912 — 168,873 — 168,873\nFederal funds purchased 193 193 — — 193\nOther short-term borrowings 2,861 — 2,872 — 2,872\nLong-term debt 16,418 14,481 1,903 — 16,384\n125\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n24. Business Segments\nThe Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset\nManagement. Results of the Bancorp’s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting\npractices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s business\nsegments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from\ntime to time as management’s accounting practices and businesses change.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp eliminated certain revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and\nConsumer and Small Business Banking. As a result, the results of operations for the Wealth and Asset Management segment for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements between\nWealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. The impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing\nagreements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in a decrease in wealth and asset management revenue and an\noffsetting decrease in other noninterest expense within the Wealth and Asset Management segment of $186 million, $177 million and $180\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are\ninsulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and\nacceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the\nestimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows\nallocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in\nbenchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and\ndeposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations\nare not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit\nrates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale\nfunding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing.\nThe Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated\ndurations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually.\nCredit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions.\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with\nchanges in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business\nsegment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and\nOther. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the\nbusiness segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital\nmarkets as a collective unit.\nThe following is a description of each of the Bancorp’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client\nbases.\nCommercial Banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and\ngovernment and professional customers. In addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial Banking products and\nservices include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-\nbased lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance.\nConsumer and Small Business Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses through a\nnetwork of full-service banking centers and relationships with indirect and correspondent loan originators in addition to providing products\ndesigned to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. Consumer and Small Business Banking\nincludes the Bancorp’s residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, automobile and other indirect lending, solar\nenergy installation and other consumer lending activities. Residential mortgage activities include the origination, retention and servicing of\nresidential mortgage loans, sales and securitizations of those loans and all associated hedging activities. Indirect lending activities include\nextending loans to consumers through automobile dealers, motorcycle dealers, powersport dealers, recreational vehicle dealers and marine\ndealers. Solar energy installation loans and certain other consumer loans are originated through a network of contractors and installers.\nWealth and Asset Management provides a full range of wealth management solutions for individuals, companies and not-for-profit\norganizations, including wealth planning, investment management, banking, insurance, trust and estate services. These offerings include retail\nbrokerage services for individual clients, advisory services for institutional clients including middle market businesses, non-profits, states and\nmunicipalities, and wealth management strategies and products for high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients.\n126\nTable of Contents\nFifth Third Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following tables present the results of operations and assets by business segment for the three months ended:\nConsumer\nand Small Wealth General\nCommercial Business and Asset Corporate\nSeptember 30, 2024 ($ in millions) Banking Banking Management and Other Total\nNet interest income $ 669 1,031 50 (329) 1,421\nProvision for credit losses 76 78 — 6 160\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses $ 593 953 50 (335) 1,261\nNoninterest income:\nWealth and asset management revenue $ 1 64 98 — 163\nService charges on deposits 104 56 — 1 161\nCommercial banking revenue 162 1 — — 163\nCard and processing revenue 27 78 1 — 106\nMortgage banking net revenue — 50 — — 50\nLeasing business revenue 43 — — — 43\nOther noninterest income 11 31 — (27) 15\nSecurities gains, net 9 — — 1 10\nTotal noninterest income $ 357 280 99 (25) 711\nNoninterest expense:\nCompensation and benefits $ 151 206 54 279 690\nTechnology and communications 3 7 — 111 121\nNet occupancy expense 9 52 3 17 81\nEquipment expense 7 13 — 18 38\nMarketing expense 1 15 — 10 26\nLeasing business expense 21 — — — 21\nCard and processing expense 2 20 — — 22\nOther noninterest expense 276 291 38 (360) 245\nTotal noninterest expense $ 470 604 95 75 1,244\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 480 629 54 (435) 728\nApplicable income tax expense (benefit) 87 132 12 (76) 155\nNet income (loss) $ 393 497 42 (359) 573\nTotal goodwill $ 2,324 2,369 225 — 4,918\nTotal assets $ 75,594 89,890 10,669 38,165 (a) 214,318\n(a) Includes bank premises and equipment of $24 classified as held for sale.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nThe event featured unique economic insights and commentary specific to the Greater Chicagoland area, an overview of manufacturing, and a 2025 outlook on the labor market, regulation and public policies, so that business owners can put data at the center of their decision-making. \n\n“Chicago, home to the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. city, stands to reap the benefits of its excellent civic infrastructure and talent pool, which are driving in major investments that could revitalize commercial infrastructure,” said Jeff Korzenik, Fifth Third Commercial Bank chief economist. \n\nThis was the fifth Empowering American Cities event hosted by Fifth Third and the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. Previous events took place in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nashville, Tennessee, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Columbus, Ohio. More than 1,000 individuals have attended the events designed to provide business owners, community leaders and others with tools to make successful, data-driven decisions. \n\nThrough the [Empowering American Cities](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.empoweringamericancities.com%2F&esheet=54157032&newsitemid=20241122105640&lan=en-US&anchor=Empowering+American+Cities&index=1&md5=6a93067a636fc84e94ee890394863162) initiative, individuals can access economic information, including individually created dashboards, based on Kenan Institute research for all Extended Metropolitan Areas in the US. The EMAs account for nearly 90% of U.S. gross domestic product and encompass the 150 largest metropolitan areas from New York City, with its $2.5 trillion economic output, to cities such as Wilmington, North Carolina with its own unique economic and industrial traits. \n\nWhile this data is proprietary to the Empowering American Cities program, it is available to anyone. Business owners can view information side-by-side to allow for direct comparisons of fiscal characteristics and other economic health indicators between EMAs. \n\n“We believe there is a vital, continuing need to understand the economy at a scale that is meaningful, and this data can help accelerate decisions that drive sustainable growth for companies, their communities and ultimately our entire country,” said Korzenik. \n\nIn 2025, Empowering American Cities will release new economic data, whitepapers and host events in seven cities across Fifth Third’s footprint. The first event will take place in Los Angeles, California in February. Details will soon be available [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fempoweringamericancities.com%2Fevents%2F&esheet=54157032&newsitemid=20241122105640&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=e64001c1d973dd1ad269d04d9fbba2b3). \n\n** About Fifth Third **\n\nFifth Third is a bank that’s as long on innovation as it is on history.
