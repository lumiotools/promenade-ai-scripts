(Nasdaq: SPRB), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for endocrine and neurological disorders with significant unmet medical need, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided corporate updates. \n\n“We remain on track to report primary efficacy and safety data plus interim data from the open-label extension of the CAHmelia-204 study of tildacerfont in adult CAH patients in December 2024. At the same time, we will also report topline dose-ranging efficacy and safety data from the CAHptain-205 study of tildacerfont in adult and pediatric CAH patients,” said Javier Szwarcberg, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Executive Officer of Spruce. “It is an honor to continue partnering with the CAH community to open a new chapter in the management of CAH. We recognize the potentially transformative impact of tildacerfont, and we have a strong sense of urgency to deliver on our commitment to CAH patients.” \n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n**_CAHmelia-204 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult CAH_ :**[CAHmelia-204](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsprucebio.com%2Fcahmelia%2F&esheet=54149671&newsitemid=20241111107317&lan=en-US&anchor=CAHmelia-204&index=2&md5=eb67ae88e5cc95918b783eda0fac1822) is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in reducing supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (GC) usage, a potentially registrational endpoint, in 90 adults with classic CAH on supraphysiologic doses of GCs with normal or near normal levels of androstenedione (A4) at baseline. In the first part of the clinical trial, patients were randomized to receive 200mg of tildacerfont once-daily (QD) or placebo for 24 weeks. During the second part of the clinical trial, all patients received 200mg of tildacerfont QD for 52 weeks. Throughout the trial, tapering of GCs is guided according to a pre-specified algorithm and continue to physiologic replacement levels, as long as patients remain well controlled based on standard biomarkers and clinical assessments. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is the absolute change in daily GC dose in hydrocortisone equivalents (HCe) from baseline through week 24. \n\n**_CAHptain-205 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult and Pediatric CAH_ :**[CAHptain-205](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05128942%3Fcond%3Dtildacerfont%26rank%3D3&esheet=54149671&newsitemid=20241111107317&lan=en-US&anchor=CAHptain-205&index=3&md5=98a8fc9aaea540d43e5a56d706fe2cf1) is a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which utilizes a sequential nine cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in adults and children between two and 17 years of age. Cohorts 1-3 evaluated weight-adjusted doses of tildacerfont between 50mg QD and 200mg QD in pediatric CAH patients between two and 17 years of age, and assessed changes in androgen levels over 12 weeks of treatment as well as the ability to reduce daily GC dose based on A4 normalization. Cohorts 4-9 are evaluating weight-adjusted doses of tildacerfont of 200mg twice-daily (BID) and 400mg BID in adults and children between two and 17 years of age and is assessing changes in androgen levels over four weeks of treatment. An optional open-label extension period will provide additional open-label treatment with tildacerfont to provide long-term safety data for up to two years. \n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Topline results from the CAHmelia-204 clinical trial of tildacerfont 200mg QD in adult classic CAH patients on supraphysiologic doses of GCs with normal or near normal levels of A4 anticipated in December 2024\n  * Topline results from the CAHptain-205 clinical trial of tildacerfont 200mg BID and 400mg BID adult and pediatric cohorts anticipated in December 2024\n  * End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration anticipated in the first half of 2025 \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were $60.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents are expected to allow the company to fund its current operating plan through the end of 2025. \n  * **Collaboration Revenue:** Collaboration revenue was $0.6 million and $4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $3.1 million and $7.2 million for the same periods in 2023. The collaboration revenue reflects the partial recognition of the $15.0 million upfront payment the company received in April 2023 in connection with the collaboration and license agreement with Kaken Pharmaceutical. \n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $6.6 million and $25.0 million, respectively, compared to $13.5 million and $38.3 million for the same periods in 2023. The overall decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by the decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses related to the termination of the CAHmelia-203 study, completion of enrollment in the company’s CAHmelia-204 study, and completion of the Phase 2 POWER study in polycystic ovary syndrome, offset by an increase in expenses related to the ongoing CAHptain-205 study. \n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, compared to $3.2 million and $9.7 million for the same periods in 2023. \n  * **Total Operating Expenses:** Total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $10.0 million and $36.3 million, respectively, compared to $16.7 million and $48.0 million for the same periods in 2023. Operating expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation expenses of $1.1 million and $4.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $1.1 million and $3.4 million for the same periods in 2023. \n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively, compared to $12.4 million and $38.0 million for the same periods in 2023. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Investor Conferences**\n\nJavier Szwarcberg, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Executive Officer, will present at the Guggenheim Securities Healthcare Innovation Conference on November 11, 2024, at 3:30 p.m. ET. \n\nInterested parties can access the live webcast [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwsw.com%2Fwebcast%2Fguggen%2Fregister.aspx%3Fconf%3Dguggen%26page%3Dsprb%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwsw.com%2Fwebcast%2Fguggen%2Fsprb%2F1955803&esheet=54149671&newsitemid=20241111107317&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=4&md5=e8e20f76a367dd52e1b6548f05d31e8e).

Following our analysis of results from the CAHmelia-203 study, which evaluated doses of tildacerfont up to 200mg once-daily (QD) in adults with CAH and highly elevated levels of A4, we believe that tildacerfont has the potential to address severe hyperandrogenemia in CAH at higher doses taken BID. If results from CAHmelia-204 and CAHptain-205 are positive, we intend to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to align on the next steps for our CAH program.” \n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * **Announced Strategic Collaboration with HMNC to Develop Personalized Treatment for MDD:** Spruce entered into a license, development and option agreement with HMNC to develop Spruce’s investigational product candidate, tildacerfont, a second-generation CRF1 receptor antagonist, with HMNC’s companion diagnostic, the proprietary Cortibon Genetic Selection Tool (Cortibon), as a personalized medicine with potential for the treatment of MDD. Under the terms of the agreement, HMNC will fund and conduct a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of tildacerfont in MDD patients, who will be screened using Cortibon. Spruce has an option to in-license exclusive worldwide rights to Cortibon after completion of the study, if results are positive. \n\n\n  * **Poster Highlighting Final Results from Phase 2 POWER Study of Tildacerfont for the Treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Presented at ENDO 2024 Annual Meeting:** Ricardo Azziz, M.D., M.B.A., M.P.H., Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology at University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, presented final results from the Phase 2 POWER study, which demonstrated the ability of tildacerfont to reduce dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels over 12 weeks in women with PCOS. Additionally, an observed increase in serum sex hormone binding globulin demonstrated that tildacerfont may potentially lower levels of free, bioactive sex hormones such as testosterone. Tildacerfont was well-tolerated, with no safety signals observed. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate, and no serious adverse reactions were reported.

Davis School of Medicine, presented findings related to the need for increased partnership between primary care physicians and endocrinologists as well as increased education among CAH patients and advocacy groups of specialty care to improve biochemical outcomes that reduce risks of morbidity and mortality in adult CAH patients. The poster presentation is available on the [company’s website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.sprucebio.com%2Fstatic-files%2F08e42c7b-05e9-43a9-9629-adc5a3ae0a26&esheet=54107646&newsitemid=20240812918390&lan=en-US&anchor=company%26%238217%3Bs+website&index=3&md5=dfe680fd3f2b0d8ed7d2af9a61dbde73). \n\n\n  * **Poster Highlighting Pediatric and Adult Endocrinology Practices to Improve Biochemical Outcomes in Adults with CAH Presented at ENDO 2024 Annual Meeting:** Wenyu Huang, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Molecular Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and Amir Hamrahian, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at Johns Hopkins University, presented findings exploring the risks associated with CAH diagnosis and treatment, including health impacts of hyperandrogenemia and serious adverse events with long-term use of supraphysiologic GC doses. The poster presentation is available on the [company’s website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.sprucebio.com%2Fstatic-files%2F08e42c7b-05e9-43a9-9629-adc5a3ae0a26&esheet=54107646&newsitemid=20240812918390&lan=en-US&anchor=company%26%238217%3Bs+website&index=4&md5=dec880f9f988998c2211a388a316ed89). \n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Topline results from the CAHmelia-204 clinical trial of tildacerfont 200mg QD in adult classic CAH patients on supraphysiologic doses of GCs with normal or near normal levels of A4 anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024 \n\n\n  * Topline results from the CAHptain-205 clinical trial of tildacerfont 200mg BID and 400mg BID adult and pediatric cohorts anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024 \n\n\n  * End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. FDA anticipated in the first half of 2025 \n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024 were $69.7 million. Cash and cash equivalents are expected to allow the company to fund its current operating plan through the end of 2025. \n\n\n  * **Collaboration Revenue:** Collaboration revenue was $1.6 million and $3.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $2.2 million and $4.1 million for the same periods in 2023. The collaboration revenue reflects the partial recognition of the $15.0 million upfront payment the company received in April 2023 in connection with the collaboration and license agreement with Kaken Pharmaceutical. \n\n\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were $8.1 million and $18.4 million, respectively, compared to $13.1 million and $24.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The overall decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by the decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses related to the termination of the CAHmelia-203 study, completion of enrollment in the company’s CAHmelia-204 study, and completion of the Phase 2 POWER study in PCOS. \n\n\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were $3.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, compared to $3.0 million and $6.5 million for the same periods in 2023. \n\n\n  * **Total Operating Expenses:** Total operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were $11.6 million and $26.3 million, respectively, compared to $16.1 million and $31.3 million for the same periods in 2023. Operating expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation expenses of $1.7 million and $3.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $1.2 million and $2.3 million for the same periods in 2023. \n\n\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was $9.2 million and $20.8 million, respectively, compared to $12.8 million and $25.6 million for the same periods in 2023. \n\n\n\n**About Spruce Biosciences**\n\nSpruce Biosciences is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for endocrine and neurological disorders with significant unmet medical need.
