We also entered a transformative binding agreement with Infinite Reality to merge dynamic, world-class audience assets, and now stand at the precipice of a game-changing transaction that we anticipate will transform us into a “new company” come January 1st, fueled by a more diverse portfolio of assets and a significant strategic investment providing for a strong balance sheet.\n\nThis union goes beyond merging assets and investment; it is about shaping the future of digital and physical interaction and commerce. Super League will be granted a worldwide perpetual license to produce events and sell sponsorships for the Drone Racing League, a tech-driven global sports property with over 100 million young fans across 170 countries, and we will assume ownership of Thunder Studios, TalentX and Fearless Media to bolster our reach and digital marketing capabilities. We see many areas of synergy between Super League and Infinite Reality, from the cross-pollination of sales pipelines and brand partner pursuits to ways we can accelerate our product development roadmaps.\n\nIn Q3, we continued to see a pipeline of blue-chip brands choosing Super League as their immersive and interactive solutions provider, proven through our activations with the International Olympic Committee, Visa, Maybelline, Google and Universal Pictures. We also continue to see indications of a positive shift in our business model in terms of both deal size and, as brands increasingly look to engage us repeatedly and for longer, more persistent programs that create more recurring revenues for us. Coupled with our focus on accelerating market adoption of our higher margin pop-up experiences and more efficient, lean cost structure, we are well positioned to turn the corner into profitability.\n\nLooking ahead, our product and technology approach are how we scale market adoption by leading global brands as we continue to redefine gaming as a digital media channel. Bolstered by the addition of Infinite Reality’s audience assets that will transform the collective entity into a leading global entertainment audience and network strongly capitalized for growth, we are looking forward and see a bright future just ahead of us.”\n\nFor any questions related to the Company’s third quarter 2024 financial results or shareholder letter, please contact [SLE@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VuDe1zbAxobf-I0K30xlQK_anTM4ndw3Jds_1ftC3KiYHfw8AXjZS2KuWZ3URV8mVxMR5aPv8XgAIf0niY9BMQ==).\n\n**About Super League**\n\nSuper League (Nasdaq: SLE) is redefining the gaming industry as a media channel for global brands.

We also entered a transformative binding agreement with Infinite Reality to merge dynamic, world-class audience assets, and now stand at the precipice of a game-changing transaction that we anticipate will transform us into a “new company” come January 1st, fueled by a more diverse portfolio of assets and a significant strategic investment providing for a strong balance sheet.\n\nThis union goes beyond merging assets and investment; it is about shaping the future of digital and physical interaction and commerce. Super League will be granted a worldwide perpetual license to produce events and sell sponsorships for the Drone Racing League, a tech-driven global sports property with over 100 million young fans across 170 countries, and we will assume ownership of Thunder Studios, TalentX and Fearless Media to bolster our reach and digital marketing capabilities. We see many areas of synergy between Super League and Infinite Reality, from the cross-pollination of sales pipelines and brand partner pursuits to ways we can accelerate our product development roadmaps.\n\nIn Q3, we continued to see a pipeline of blue-chip brands choosing Super League as their immersive and interactive solutions provider, proven through our activations with the International Olympic Committee, Visa, Maybelline, Google and Universal Pictures. We also continue to see indications of a positive shift in our business model in terms of both deal size and, as brands increasingly look to engage us repeatedly and for longer, more persistent programs that create more recurring revenues for us. Coupled with our focus on accelerating market adoption of our higher margin pop-up experiences and more efficient, lean cost structure, we are well positioned to turn the corner into profitability.\n\nLooking ahead, our product and technology approach are how we scale market adoption by leading global brands as we continue to redefine gaming as a digital media channel. Bolstered by the addition of Infinite Reality’s audience assets that will transform the collective entity into a leading global entertainment audience and network strongly capitalized for growth, we are looking forward and see a bright future just ahead of us.”\n\nFor any questions related to the Company’s third quarter 2024 financial results or shareholder letter, please contact [SLE@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VuDe1zbAxobf-I0K30xlQK_anTM4ndw3Jds_1ftC3KiYHfw8AXjZS2KuWZ3URV8mVxMR5aPv8XgAIf0niY9BMQ==).\n\n**About Super League**\n\nSuper League (Nasdaq: SLE) is redefining the gaming industry as a media channel for global brands.

Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical are “forward-\nlooking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. These statements involve substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed\nor implied by such statements. Forward-looking statements in this communication include, among other things, statements about Super League’s growth\nstrategies, the ability to actualize the benefits of the acquisition of Melon, our possible or assumed business strategies, new products, potential market\nopportunities and our ability to secure adequate working capital. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, our ability to implement our plans,\nforecasts and other expectations with respect to our business; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of events that took place during and subsequent to\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, including the possibility that the expected benefits, particularly from our acquisitions consummated in 2021 and 2023,\nwill not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; unknown liabilities that may or may not be within our control; attracting new\ncustomers and maintaining and expanding our existing customer base; our ability to scale and update our platform to respond to customers’ needs and rapid\ntechnological change; increased competition in our market and our ability to compete effectively; and expansion of our operations and increased adoption of\nour platform internationally. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial condition and operating results will be included in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 and other filings that we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) which, once filed,\nare available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this communication are based on assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update\nthe reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nInformation About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used herein, “GAAP” refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To supplement our financial statements included in\nour annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC, which financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release\nincludes pro forma operating expense, proforma net loss and proforma net loss per share, financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measure\nas defined in Rule 101 of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical\nmeasure of a company’s historical or future performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally\nexcluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this non-GAAP\nfinancial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nWe use pro forma net loss, pro forma earnings per share (EPS) and other non-GAAP financial measures for internal financial and operational decision-making\npurposes and to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of the performance and results of operations of our business. Our management believes these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business by excluding non-cash intangible asset\nand goodwill impairment charges, non-cash stock compensation charges, non-cash amortization of intangible asset charges, and non-recurring, non-cash\ncharges and credits, that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate\nmanagement’s internal planning and comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to\ninvestors as they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and are used\nby our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance and operational results of our core business.\nPro Forma Net Loss and EPS. We define pro forma net loss as net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, but excluding non-cash intangible asset and\ngoodwill impairment charges, non-cash stock compensation charges, non-cash amortization of intangible assets, and non-recurring, non-cash charges and\ncredits. Pro forma EPS is defined as pro forma net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully diluted basis, calculated in\naccordance with GAAP, for the respective reporting period.\nDue to the inherent volatility in stock prices, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with the valuation and expensing of share-based awards and\nthe variety of award types that companies can issue under FASB ASC Topic 718, management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that\nexcludes non-cash stock compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of\nother companies period to period, as well as providing our management with a critical tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our\nown period-to-period recurring core business operating results.\nDue to the use of estimates and assumptions pursuant to the guidance set forth in FASB ASC Topic 805 in connection with the valuation of assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, for merger and acquisition transactions that include the issuance of common stock as all or a\ncomponent of the purchase consideration, management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash goodwill and non-cash\namortization related to these assets acquired for the applicable reporting period allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core\nbusiness operating results and those of other companies period to period, as well as providing our management with a critical tool for financial and operational\ndecision making and for evaluating our own period-to-period recurring core business operating results.\nThere are several limitations related to the use of pro forma net loss and EPS versus net loss EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP. For example, non-\nGAAP net loss excludes the impact of significant non-cash stock compensation charges that are or may be recurring for the foreseeable future. In addition, non\n-cash stock compensation is a critical component of our employee compensation and retention programs and the cost associated with consideration issued in\nconnection with mergers and acquisitions is a critical component of the cost of those acquisitions over the useful lives of the related intangible assets acquired.\nManagement compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net loss and\nevaluating non-GAAP net loss in conjunction with net loss and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe accompanying table below titled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information” provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShannon Devine / Mark Schwalenberg\nMZ North America\nMain: 203-741-8811\nSLE@mzgroup.us\nMedia Contact\nSage D’Amico\nMoxie Group\nsuperleague@moxiegrouppr.com"

We also entered a transformative binding agreement with Infinite Reality to merge dynamic, world-class audience assets, and now stand at the precipice of a game-changing transaction that we anticipate will transform us into a “new company” come January 1st, fueled by a more diverse portfolio of assets and a significant strategic investment providing for a strong balance sheet.\n\nThis union goes beyond merging assets and investment; it is about shaping the future of digital and physical interaction and commerce. Super League will be granted a worldwide perpetual license to produce events and sell sponsorships for the Drone Racing League, a tech-driven global sports property with over 100 million young fans across 170 countries, and we will assume ownership of Thunder Studios, TalentX and Fearless Media to bolster our reach and digital marketing capabilities. We see many areas of synergy between Super League and Infinite Reality, from the cross-pollination of sales pipelines and brand partner pursuits to ways we can accelerate our product development roadmaps.\n\nIn Q3, we continued to see a pipeline of blue-chip brands choosing Super League as their immersive and interactive solutions provider, proven through our activations with the International Olympic Committee, Visa, Maybelline, Google and Universal Pictures. We also continue to see indications of a positive shift in our business model in terms of both deal size and, as brands increasingly look to engage us repeatedly and for longer, more persistent programs that create more recurring revenues for us. Coupled with our focus on accelerating market adoption of our higher margin pop-up experiences and more efficient, lean cost structure, we are well positioned to turn the corner into profitability.\n\nLooking ahead, our product and technology approach are how we scale market adoption by leading global brands as we continue to redefine gaming as a digital media channel. Bolstered by the addition of Infinite Reality’s audience assets that will transform the collective entity into a leading global entertainment audience and network strongly capitalized for growth, we are looking forward and see a bright future just ahead of us.”\n\nFor any questions related to the Company’s third quarter 2024 financial results or shareholder letter, please contact [SLE@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VuDe1zbAxobf-I0K30xlQK_anTM4ndw3Jds_1ftC3KiYHfw8AXjZS2KuWZ3URV8mVxMR5aPv8XgAIf0niY9BMQ==).\n\n**About Super League**\n\nSuper League (Nasdaq: SLE) is redefining the gaming industry as a media channel for global brands.
