Announces Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Results\n\n**Second Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 3.6%****Second Quarter Gross Margin increased 250 basis points to 34.2%****Second Quarter Loss Per share improved to ( $0.04) from ($0.44) ****Third Quarter-to-date Comparable Sales up 12.1%**\n\nLYNNWOOD, Wash., Sept. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the second quarter ended August 3, 2024. \n\nNet sales for the second quarter ended August 3, 2024 (13 weeks) increased 8.1% to $210.2 million from $194.4 million in the second quarter ended July 29, 2023 (13 weeks). Comparable sales for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 increased 3.6%. The shift in the retail calendar had a positive impact on the second quarter results, increasing net sales growth by approximately 530 basis points. However, this shift will negatively affect net sales growth in the third quarter. Comparable sales growth, as reported, is adjusted for the calendar shift and provides a more accurate measure of operating performance. Net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.8 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.5 million, or $0.44 per share, in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. \n\nTotal net sales for the six months (26 weeks) ended August 3, 2024 increased 2.7% to $387.6 million from $377.3 million reported for the six months (26 weeks) ended July 29, 2023. The retail calendar shift positively impacted net sales growth by approximately 310 basis points year-to-date. Comparable sales increased 0.8% for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024. Net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was $17.6 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to a net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2023 of $26.9 million, or $1.40 per share. \n\nAt August 3, 2024, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $127.0 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $140.0 million at July 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by share repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash flow from operations. The Company repurchased 0.9 million shares during the quarter at an average cost of $20.55 per share and a total cost of $19.4 million.\n\nRick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc., stated, “We experienced a noticeable acceleration in our sales trend as the second quarter unfolded, with July North America comparable sales increasing in the high-single digits. The work our merchandise teams have done refining our apparel and footwear assortments combined with enhanced customer engagement tactics from our in-store and online sales associates led to better than expected second quarter results and a strong back-to-school season in North America. With back-to-school a good indicator for holiday demand in the past, we are encouraged about our prospects for growth over the remainder of fiscal 2024. Looking farther ahead, we are confident that our global customer centric operating model has the Company positioned to continue building on the progress we’ve made towards delivering enhanced value for our shareholders in the years to come.”\n\nThird Quarter To-DateThird quarter-to-date net sales for the 30 days ending September 2, 2024 increased 6.8%, compared with the 30 day time period in the prior year ended August 28, 2023. Total comparable sales for the 30-day period ending September 2, 2024, adjusted to exclude the impact of the calendar shift, were up 12.1% from the comparable period in the prior year. \n\nFiscal 2024 Third Quarter OutlookThe Company is introducing guidance for the three months ending November 2, 2024. Net sales are projected to be in the range of $221 to $225 million representing growth of between 2% and 4% from the third quarter in the prior year. Adjusting for the impact of the calendar shift, net sales are expected to grow between 7% and 9% compared to the same weeks in the prior year. Consolidated operating margins are expected to be between 0.2% and 1.2% with earnings per share results between a loss of ($0.04) and income of $0.06. \n\nThe Company currently intends to open approximately 9 new stores in fiscal 2024, including up to 3 stores in North America, 3 stores in Europe and 3 stores in Australia and close approximately 25 stores by the end of the year.\n\nConference call Information To access the conference call, please pre-register using this link ([Registration Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y1Of7YapzjO2ant9oGg0wy4hd5EkhCxLMCgWxOQeelFQqy9y5dhbLtRa6eooX1tPJmWpJ0o5gHlE7KyyekEYdmBCHMQydAJ6KT1eYZ0GClmJQzJiAH6SKAWb3nnMhLpu6VVibXUoY7bLnJhQvA5LSH6lEOkIrvRSm95oiyKD9MYfZ4kNbZ155O6LI7XmN_NE)) Registrants will receive confirmation with dial-in details.

Announces Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Results\n\n**Board Approves New Stock Repurchase Authorization**\n\nLYNNWOOD, Wash., June 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ), a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2024.\n\nNet sales for the first quarter ended May 4, 2024 (13 weeks) decreased 3.0% to $177.4 million from $182.9 million in the first quarter ended April 29, 2023 (13 weeks). Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $16.8 million, or $0.86 loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.4 million, or $0.96 loss per diluted share, in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.\n\nAt May 4, 2024, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $146.6 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $155.3 million at April 29, 2023. The decrease was driven by capital expenditures of $17.5 million over this time period, offset by $9.1 million provided by operating activities.\n\nRick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc., stated, “Fiscal 2024 is off to an encouraging start as we once again achieved sequential improvement in our year-over-year quarterly sales trends and both top and bottom line results exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter. The results were driven by our North American region which inflected positive in the first quarter. At the same time, our focus on improving full priced selling in Europe helped expand merchandise margins, which more than offset expense deleverage and fueled enhanced operating performance versus a year ago, even as overall sales remained under pressure. We still have much work to do to return to historic levels of both sales and profitability, but I am confident that our strategies to reinvigorate growth and reduce our cost base have us on the path to deliver further progress over the remainder of this year and beyond.”\n\nMay 2024 SalesNet sales for the four-week period ended June 1, 2024 increased 1.8% compared to the four-week period ended May 27, 2023. Comparable sales for the four-week period ending June 1, 2024 decreased 0.2% from the comparable period in the prior year.\n\nFiscal 2024 Second Quarter OutlookThe Company is introducing guidance for the three months ending August 3, 2024. Net sales are projected to be in the range of $199 to $204 million. Loss per share is expected to be between $0.30 to $0.40.\n\nThe Company currently intends to open approximately 10 new stores in fiscal 2024, including up to 3 stores in North America, 3 stores in Europe and 4 stores in Australia.\n\nStock Repurchase Authorization On June 5, 2024, Zumiez Inc. approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $25 million of common stock. The repurchase program is expected to continue through June 30, 2025 unless the time period is extended or shortened by the Board of Directors.\n\nConference call Information To access today’s first quarter 2024 earnings call at 5:00 PM ET, please pre-register using this link [(Registration Link)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mtvCQSc3FjTSRXhXR8hmUHA1htt2uu07RAfZ8eLPt9fXCfsVH7XQscBoFBZkx5ggzUL7nN6p0_ZTC0JtG8pqXPRbND-bldoDXxYybgHMqVcnFZ4Uzm1-L6CXwPPk_6Y29Q9o5sifkB2Mync1r_IHUSlyEKHbSFqKOZRfIteCi4A=).
