(NASDAQ: MNMD), (the \"Company\" or \"MindMed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel product candidates to treat brain health disorders, today announced the appointment of Gregg A.

His leadership will strengthen our capabilities and accelerate our progress as we prepare to launch three Phase 3 studies of MM120 orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD),” said Rob Barrow, Chief Executive Officer of MindMed. “Gregg’s deep expertise in leading the regulatory approvals of transformative psychiatric drugs—demonstrated by his recent leadership in the approval of the first novel schizophrenia treatment in decades—will be key as we advance our Phase 3 programs. His appointment also reflects our strong commitment to clinical and regulatory excellence as we aim for two potential approvals in the coming years and work to transform the treatment of brain health disorders.”\n\n“The therapeutic potential of MM120 ODT, as demonstrated in the Phase 2b study results, inspired me to join MindMed in pursuing what could be one of the most meaningful breakthroughs in the field of psychiatry,” said Dr. Pratt. “With our Phase 3 trial initiations imminent, I am eager to collaborate with the team to ensure our regulatory approach supports continued execution of the Company’s strategy and, if approved, to deliver MM120 ODT as a novel, much-needed therapy for millions of patients living with GAD and MDD.”\n\nDr. Pratt brings more than three decades of experience in drug development, registration, and commercialization, with a distinguished career spanning multiple therapeutic areas including psychiatry, neurology, and cardiology. Dr. Pratt joins MindMed from Karuna Therapeutics, which Bristol Myers Squibb acquired in March 2024. At Karuna, he served as Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance, where he oversaw the regulatory submission and ultimate approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of COBENFY™, the first product in four decades with a novel mechanism of action in schizophrenia. Before joining Karuna Therapeutics, Dr. Pratt held leadership positions at Lundbeck, Abbvie, Solvay, Collegium, Baxter, and Assertio Therapeutics, where he led regulatory affairs in drug, biologic, and combination product development strategies, as well as registration maintenance for approved products in global markets. Dr. Pratt has a Ph.D. in chemistry from West Virginia University and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wyoming.\n\n**Inducement Grants under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4)**\n\nIn connection with his appointment as Chief Regulatory and Quality Assurance Officer, MindMed granted Dr. Pratt an inducement award consisting of an option to purchase an aggregate of 350,000 common shares of the Company (the \"Option\"), with an effective grant date of November 18, 2024.
