([NASDAQ: IBRX](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fmarket-activity%2Fstocks%2Fibrx&esheet=54154908&newsitemid=20241119975432&lan=en-US&anchor=NASDAQ%3A+IBRX&index=1&md5=744e61fdc7f88c755fd3e3f2ad021870)), a leading immunotherapy company, today announced compelling new data from its ongoing QUILT 3.032 study. As of November 2024, 100 patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with carcinoma in situ (NMIBC CIS) have been treated with ANKTIVA® (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) in combination with BCG, achieving a 71% complete response (CR) rate. In these responders, the range of durable response extended to 54 months. This data update will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ANKTIVA in the European Union (EU), which is anticipated during Q4 2024. \n\nThis significant milestone underscores the potential of ANKTIVA to provide durable responses in patients with limited treatment options. The QUILT 3.032 study is a single-arm, multicenter trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ANKTIVA plus BCG in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS. The observed 71% CR rate aligns with previous findings reported in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ (_NEJM Evidence_ , Chamie 2022) and reinforces the therapeutic promise of this combination therapy. \n\n“We are encouraged by the consistent complete response rates observed in our expanded patient cohort,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ImmunityBio. “These results highlight the potential of ANKTIVA to transform the treatment landscape for patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS, offering hope for improved outcomes and cystectomy avoidance, especially with the prolonged duration of response now ranging as much as 54 months in this 100-patient analysis. Duration of complete response is the key efficacy element in driving cystectomy avoidance in this BCG-unresponsive population. I am pleased that this updated ANKTIVA data confirms that one of the highest durable responses is achieved when compared to other approved products in this indication.” \n\nThe QUILT 3.032 study continues to monitor patients to assess the durability of responses and overall survival outcomes. ImmunityBio remains committed to advancing innovative immunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to combat cancer. \n\n**About ANKTIVA**\n\nThe cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays a crucial role in the immune system by affecting the development, maintenance, and function of key immune cells—NK and CD8+ killer T cells—that are involved in killing cancer cells. By activating NK cells, ANKTIVA overcomes the tumor escape phase of clones resistant to T cells and restores memory T cell activity with resultant prolonged duration of complete response. ANKTIVA is a first-in-class IL-15 agonist IgG1 fusion complex, consisting of an IL-15 mutant (IL-15N72D) fused with an IL-15 receptor alpha, which binds with high affinity to IL-15 receptors on NK, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. This fusion complex of ANKTIVA mimics the natural biological properties of the membrane-bound IL-15 receptor alpha, delivering IL-15 by dendritic cells and drives the activation and proliferation of NK cells with the generation of memory killer T cells that have retained immune memory against these tumor clones. The proliferation of the trifecta of these immune killing cells and the activation of trained immune memory results in immunogenic cell death, inducing a state of equilibrium with durable complete responses. ANKTIVA has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues, and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in-vivo. \n\n**About ImmunityBio**\n\nImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. The Company’s range of immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive and sustain an immune response with the goal of creating durable and safe protection against disease. Designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, ANKTIVA is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer CIS that activates natural killer cells, T cells, and memory T cells for a long-duration response. The Company is applying its science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.

([NASDAQ: IBRX](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fmarket-activity%2Fstocks%2Fibrx&esheet=54151124&newsitemid=20241112689334&lan=en-US&anchor=NASDAQ%3A+IBRX&index=1&md5=eed2e848dd4bd4f76183fd496980376e)) today announced its financial results for the third-quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n  * ANKTIVA® received a J-code (HCPCS Level II Code) in October 2024, effective January 1, 2025. \n  * ANKTIVA (FDA-approved and commercially available in the U.S. since May 2024) is now widely accessible to patients through commercial and government insurance programs (VA, DoD, Medicare). ImmunityBio has secured coverage for over 200 million medical lives through medical reimbursement policies. \n  * ImmunityBio achieved a net product revenue of approximately $6.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, surpassing net product revenue of $1.0 million in the prior quarter and analyst estimates. \n  * ImmunityBio has extended the shelf life of ANKTIVA from two years to three years, with over 125,000 doses, providing ample product for the market and for clinical trials. \n  * ImmunityBio submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ANKTIVA in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2024. \n  * ImmunityBio intends to submit to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) an MAA for ANKTIVA in the European Union (EU) in Q4 2024, covering 30 countries, including 27 in the EU and 3 in the European Economic Area (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein). \n\n\n\n“The U.S. launch of ANKTIVA for NMIBC CIS continues to gain momentum, and we are pleased to see the clinical impact for patients,” said Richard Adcock, President and CEO of ImmunityBio. “Our permanent J-code has been issued by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and will be effective January 1, 2025. Our submission of ANKTIVA for NMIBC CIS to the MHRA in the UK for potential approval demonstrates our plans for global expansion. Further, we anticipate an EU submission this quarter.” \n\n“The response from the urologists and clinical practices with regard to the utility of ANKTIVA in NMIBC CIS has been gratifying. ImmunityBio’s clinical trial in BCG naïve NMIBC is enrolling well, and clinical sites have been expanded from the U.S. to multiple global locations. In the urology space, initial clinical trials of ANKTIVA are being designed for high-risk prostate cancer,” said Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, Executive Chairman, Global Chief Scientific & Medical Officer of ImmunityBio. “With the approval of ANKTIVA and the label of activating NK cells, CD4+ CD8+ T cells with memory T cells, ImmunityBio is focusing the regulatory development of ANKTIVA in BCG naïve bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have failed checkpoint inhibitors.” \n\n**Third-Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Summary**\n\n**_Cash and Marketable Securities Position_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $130.4 million. \n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses increased $2.0 million to $50.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $48.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by personnel-related and other R&D costs, partially offset by a decrease in external R&D expense driven by lower CMO fees and material purchases. \n\n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.1 million to $35.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $31.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits expense as a result of a reversal of discretionary compensation not paid in the prior period and an increase in consulting costs associated with commercial activities. \n\n**_Net Loss Attributable to ImmunityBio Common Stockholders_**\n\nNet loss attributable to ImmunityBio common stockholders was $85.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $95.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**ImmunityBio, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30 ,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30 ,**  \n_(in thousands, except per share amounts;

By activating NK cells, ANKTIVA overcomes the tumor escape phase of clones resistant to T cells and restores memory T cell activity with resultant prolonged duration of complete response. \n\nANKTIVA is a first-in-class IL-15 agonist IgG1 fusion complex, consisting of an IL-15 mutant (IL-15N72D) fused with an IL-15 receptor alpha, which binds with high affinity to IL-15 receptors on NK, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. This fusion complex of ANKTIVA mimics the natural biological properties of the membrane-bound IL-15 receptor alpha, delivering IL-15 by dendritic cells and drives the activation and proliferation of NK cells with the generation of memory killer T cells that have retained immune memory against these tumor clones. The proliferation of the trifecta of these immune killing cells and the activation of trained immune memory results in immunogenic cell death, inducing a state of equilibrium with durable complete responses. ANKTIVA has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues, and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in-vivo. \n\n**About ImmunityBio**\n\nImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. The Company’s range of immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive and sustain an immune response with the goal of creating durable and safe protection against disease. Designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, ANKTIVA is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer CIS that activates natural killer cells, T cells, and memory T cells for a long-duration response. The Company is applying its science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.

([NASDAQ: IBRX](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fmarket-activity%2Fstocks%2Fibrx__%3B%21%21LM3lv1w8qtQ%21RDPuRIfTcdDubgHhDOcVYkFfxIlpIBrynFg8k8BlPHzLOOT6E1fbVFX9AIK7gEfcixQslxoVx1DFbw4BWLQYXr3Sh4I5%24&esheet=54141647&newsitemid=20241024393866&lan=en-US&anchor=NASDAQ%3A+IBRX&index=1&md5=a8b598f445e152c0c322fa261a2c1f22)), announced today that the first patients have been dosed in an initial trial studying the potential of the company’s CAR-NK cell therapy targeting CD-19 in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). In the QUILT 106 trial, CD19-targeted high-affinity natural killer (t-haNK) cells are being tested initially as a single agent, and after demonstrating safety, then in combination with standard NHL treatment rituximab, in participants with selected CD19+ and CD20+ relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL. The phase 1, open label clinical study is designed to enroll up to 10 participants and is being conducted in Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Bloemfontein, South Africa. \n\nThis is the first cellular-targeted natural killer (NK) cell therapy study ever to be conducted in South Africa, and is designed to provide important clinical information on a cancer with a significant rate of diagnosis in the region, but with few treatment options. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the 6th most common malignancy among people in Sub-Saharan Africa and it is the 4th most diagnosed cancer in men and the 5th most diagnosed cancer in women in South Africa, according to the Cancer Association of South Africa. \n\n“This trial is important for ImmunityBio as our first clinical study of our CAR-NK, CD19 t-haNK cell line, as well as one of our first studies in liquid tumors,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Executive Chairman, Founder and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at ImmunityBio. “We have chosen to undertake this trial because Sub-Saharan African and, in particular, South African populations are often overlooked when it comes to advanced clinical research, despite the need for innovative immunotherapies in the region.” \n\nFull patient enrollment in this Phase 1 study of CD19 t-haNK is currently expected in the first quarter of calendar year 2025 with topline data readout expected in the second half of the calendar year 2025. \n\nThis study, being conducted in South Africa, is similar to ImmunityBio’s U.S.-based trial QUILT 3.092, a phase 1 open-label study of CD19 t-haNK as a single agent and in combination with the company’s IL-15 superagonist (N-803; ANKTIVA®) and rituximab in participants with relapsed or refractory NHL. \n\n**About the QUILT 106 Study**\n\nThe Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label study is designed to enroll up to 10 participants at sites in Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Bloemfontein, South Africa with the primary endpoint of the trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR-NK, CD19 t-haNK as a single agent and in combination with rituximab in participants with selected CD19+ and CD20+ R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Participants will initially receive a single 3-week cycle of the CD19 t-haNK as a single-agent regime. Following a 1-week safety pause, participants will then receive a 3-week cycle of CD19 t-haNK in combination with rituximab. Patients will undergo multiple assessments of safety and efficacy to help evaluate the safety of CD19 t-haNK as a single agent and in combination with rituximab in participants with R/R NHL, who have active disease after completing ≥ 2 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n**About CAR-NK, CD19 t-haNK**\n\nCD19 t-haNK is a human, allogeneic, stable clonal NK cell line generated from the parental activated NK (aNK) cell line (NK-92). Based on the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting and on the important role of FcγR-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the effectiveness of therapeutic IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, it was hypothesized that modification of the parental aNK cell line to stably express both a CD19-targeted CAR and the high-affinity variant of CD16 would result in potent and selective antitumor activity. Therefore, the novel CD19 t-haNK cells have been genetically engineered to stably express 3 main proteins: (1) a human CD19-targeted CAR; (2) the high-affinity variant of the human Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIIa/CD16a 158V) for enhanced ADCC; and (3) endoplasmic reticulum-retained version of human interleukin-2 (ERIL-2) for independent growth. \n\n**Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous disease that most commonly originates in B lymphocytes. In 2020, according to the South Africa National Cancer Registry ([SANCR 2020](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicd.ac.za%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2FThe-National-Pathology-Cancer-Incidence-Report-2020.pdf&esheet=54141647&newsitemid=20241024393866&lan=en-US&anchor=SANCR+2020&index=2&md5=cbb8a2c24f829951af4f3f505dc11e65)), it is estimated that 1 in 174 men and 1 in 288 women will develop NHL. According to Global Cancer Observatory ([Sung 2021](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F33538338%2F&esheet=54141647&newsitemid=20241024393866&lan=en-US&anchor=Sung+2021&index=3&md5=35f07db0539a5c2efa1add00fccfa473)), the incidence of NHL is 4.1% of all cancers. A comparative study of the distribution of NHL subtypes in South Africa reported that Southern Africa had a significantly lower proportion of low-grade B cell NHL (34.3%) and a higher proportion of high-grade B cell NHL (51.5%) compared to Western Europe (54.5% and 36.4%) and North America (56.1% and 34.3%) ([Perry 2015](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F26898194%2F&esheet=54141647&newsitemid=20241024393866&lan=en-US&anchor=Perry+2015&index=4&md5=6f4bc9c59196f7dc3605803aac33cef1)). \n\n**About ImmunityBio**\n\nImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases.

The company’s range of immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive and sustain an immune response with the goal of creating durable and safe protection against disease. Designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, ANKTIVA® is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer CIS that activates natural killer cells, T cells, and memory T cells for a long-duration response. The company is applying its science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.\n\nFor more information, visit [www.immunitybio.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimmunitybio.com%2F&esheet=54138494&newsitemid=20241021229120&lan=en-US&anchor=www.immunitybio.com&index=3&md5=a3cd2e8d914e82192f42b83a4585200e) and connect with us on [X](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FImmunityBio&esheet=54138494&newsitemid=20241021229120&lan=en-US&anchor=X&index=4&md5=171e9a7315b9eeac5d8439847d272d96) (Twitter), [Facebook](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FImmunityBio1&esheet=54138494&newsitemid=20241021229120&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=5&md5=64d4fd3a4e9eebb4037af4b123361e00), [LinkedIn](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fimmunitybio%2F&esheet=54138494&newsitemid=20241021229120&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=6&md5=0fa3f59a4defe7c89f0e1a528612e9cc), and [Instagram](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fimmunitybio%2F%3Fhl%3Den&esheet=54138494&newsitemid=20241021229120&lan=en-US&anchor=Instagram&index=7&md5=e57dd0b00514d73276d84b2035bf90cf).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements regarding conference participation and timing, the development of therapeutics for cancer and infectious diseases, potential benefits to patients, potential treatment outcomes for patients, the described mechanism of action and results and contributions therefrom, potential future uses and applications of ANKTIVA and use in cancer vaccines and across multiple tumor types, and ImmunityBio’s approved product and investigational agents as compared to existing treatment options, among others.
