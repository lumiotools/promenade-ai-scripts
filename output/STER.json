(NASDAQ:STER) today announced that the deadline for (i) record holders of vested shares of Sterling common stock and (ii) eligible holders of Sterling common stock equivalents (Sterling common stock equivalents is defined as “Company Common Stock Equivalents” in the Merger Agreement (as defined below)) and unvested shares of Sterling common stock to elect the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in connection with First Advantage’s acquisition of Sterling (the \"Transaction\") is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 24, 2024 (such deadline, as it may be extended, the \"Election Deadline\"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of February 28, 2024, by and among First Advantage, Sterling, and Starter Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of First Advantage. Sterling stockholders who hold shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier election deadline and should carefully review any materials they received from their bank, broker or other nominee. The parties expect to close the Transaction on October 31, 2024, subject to the receipt of regulatory clearances and approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. If such clearances, approvals and conditions are not received or satisfied as expected, the parties may elect to extend the Election Deadline and the anticipated closing of the Transaction will be a later date.\n\nThe election materials necessary for record holders of vested shares of Sterling common stock to make an election as to the form of merger consideration they wish to receive were sent beginning on September 5, 2024, to record holders of Sterling common stock. The election process associated with the Transaction for eligible holders of Sterling common stock equivalents and unvested shares of Sterling common stock is being administered by Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC and the online site through which the eligible holders are able to make their elections (the “Fidelity Election Site”) opened on September 5, 2024.\n\nSterling stockholders of record wishing to make an election must deliver properly completed election materials to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, by the Election Deadline. Sterling stockholders who hold shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier election deadline and must carefully review and properly complete any election materials they received from their bank, broker or other nominee regarding how to make an election.

(NASDAQ: STER) (“Sterling” or “the Company”) a leading global provider of technology-enabled background and identity verification services, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\nAll results compared to prior-year period, except where otherwise noted.\n\n  * Revenues increased 5.3% year-over-year to $200.5 million. Organic constant currency revenue decreased 0.9% from the prior year period and inorganic revenue grew 6.2% from the prior year period. Year-over-year organic revenue trends in the second quarter of 2024 improved from the first quarter of 2024, including an acceleration in growth from new business to 7% year-over-year, an acceleration in growth from up-sell/cross-sell to 9% year-over-year, and continued strong trends in customer retention of 97%. Base business declined 14% year-over-year, reflecting an improvement from the first quarter as well.\n  * GAAP net (loss) income decreased from the prior year period to a loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or $0.00 per diluted share for the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.4% year-over-year to $46.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 320 bps year-over-year to 23.1%, but expanded by 240 bps from the first quarter due to improved revenue trends combined with continued expense discipline. Year-over-year margin contraction was driven by increased volume from M&A activity at lower margins and higher third-party vendor costs as a percentage of revenue due to organic revenue mix, partially offset by lower costs driven by our cost optimization efforts.\n  * Adjusted Net Income decreased 16.8% year-over-year to $21.8 million. Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted decreased 17.9% year-over-year to $0.23 per diluted share.\n\n\n\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth (decline), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as applicable.\n\nJosh Peirez, Sterling CEO, said, “The second quarter was another period of solid business momentum and encouraging financial results as we continued to execute on our 2024 plans and long-term strategy. During the quarter, we accelerated our revenue growth to 5% year-over-year, with particularly robust organic revenue growth from new business, up-sell / cross-sell, and client retention, alongside solid inorganic revenue growth. Our world-class product innovation and user experiences continue to resonate in the marketplace, and our go-to-market engine has sustained its strong momentum built on domain expertise, customer service, and technological excellence. While hiring trends remain challenging in an uncertain macro-economic environment, our Q2 base declines narrowed from Q1, and we expect further improvement over the course of the year. Moderated base declines should also help drive further expansion in our margins which improved significantly from the first quarter due to revenue growth and expense discipline. We are excited by the pending transaction with First Advantage, expected to close in Q4 2024, and we look forward to even greater innovation, client experiences, and shareholder value creation once the synergistic deal closes.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, except per share data and percentages)**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenues| $| 200,528| $| 190,384| 5.3| %  \nNet (loss) income| $| (6,232)| $| 323| N/M  \nNet (loss) income margin| (3.1)| %| 0.2| %| (330) bps  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.07)| $| 0.00| N/M  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| 46,284| $| 49,997| (7.4)| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)| 23.1| %| 26.3| %| (320) bps  \nAdjusted Net Income(1)| $| 21,792| $| 26,204| (16.8)| %  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted(1)| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| (17.9)| %  \n  \n___________________\n\nN/M—Not meaningful.\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $200.5 million, an increase of $10.1 million, or 5.3%, compared to $190.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The revenue increase for the second quarter of 2024 included 6.2% inorganic revenue growth, partially offset by a 0.9% organic constant currency revenue decline. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisition of Vault Workforce Screening (“Vault”). For the three months ended June 30, 2023, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisition of Socrates Limited and its affiliates (“Socrates”) and A-Check Global (“A-Check”).\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $74.2 million and total debt was $555.5 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $54.2 million and total debt was $498.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash was driven by our core operations, and the increase in debt reflects the revolving credit facility drawdown of $65.0 million for the acquisition of Vault. Sterling ended the second quarter of 2024 with a net leverage ratio of 2.8x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. As of June 30, 2024, we had $555.5 million outstanding under our credit agreement, $129.5 million of capacity remaining under our revolving credit facility and $0.7 million outstanding letters of credit.\n\nFollowing the quarter end, we used available cash on hand to repay $20.0 million on the outstanding revolving credit facility. As of the date of this filing, the Company has $535.5 million outstanding under our credit agreement, $149.5 million of capacity remaining under our revolving credit facility, and $0.7 million outstanding letters of credit.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, Sterling generated net cash provided by operations of $20.2 million, compared to $32.9 million for the prior year period. Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $11.3 million, compared to $9.2 million for the prior year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, Sterling had $8.8 million of Free Cash Flow, compared to $23.7 million of Free Cash Flow for the prior year period. The decrease in Free Cash Flow compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by lower operating income and higher cash taxes paid. The increase in Free Cash Flow in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in operating income and normalization in cash tax payments.\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure. Please see the schedule accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operations, its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to combine with First Advantage Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“First Advantage”). In light of the pending merger with First Advantage, Sterling will not be hosting an earnings conference call to review its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and it is intended that all forward-looking statements that we make will be subject to the safe harbor protections created thereby. Forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “will” or “would,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. In particular, statements that address market trends or projections about the future, and statements regarding Sterling’s expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, prospects or assumptions, or statements regarding future events or performance, including those related to our pending merger with First Advantage, contained in this release are forward-looking statements. Sterling has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. Such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Sterling’s control. Important factors relating to the proposed merger with First Advantage could also cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this release, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, (ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the proposed merger, including the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals and clearances, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed merger on Sterling’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (v) risks that the proposed merger disrupts current plans and operations of Sterling or First Advantage and creates potential difficulties in Sterling employee retention as a result of the proposed merger, (vi) risks related to diverting management’s attention from Sterling’s ongoing business operations, (vii) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed merger, (viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the proposed merger that may impact Sterling’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions and (ix) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against First Advantage or against Sterling related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed merger. These and other important factors, including those discussed more fully elsewhere in this release and in Sterling’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly Sterling’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, or could affect Sterling’s share price. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future performance and actual results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which Sterling operates, may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by law, Sterling does not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis release contains “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\n\nSpecifically, Sterling makes use of the non-GAAP financial measures “organic constant currency revenue growth (decline)”, “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted Net Income,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share” and “Free Cash Flow” to assess the performance of its business.\n\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth (decline) is calculated by adjusting for inorganic revenue growth (decline), which is defined as the impact to revenue growth (decline) in the current period from merger and acquisition (“M&A”) activity that has occurred over the past twelve months, and converting the current period revenue at foreign currency exchange rates consistent with the prior period. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisition of Vault (acquired in January 2024) and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisitions of Vault as well as A-Check (acquired in March 2023). We present organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; however, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such a measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) does not reflect M&A activity or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses related to the IPO, one-time public company transition expenses and costs associated with financing transactions, M&A activity, optimization and restructuring, technology transformation costs, foreign currency (gains) and losses and other costs affecting comparability. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable period. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate the factors and trends affecting our business to assess our financial performance and in preparing and approving our annual budget and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance. Further, our executive incentive compensation is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be considered only in conjunction with net income (loss) for the period. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP profitability measure. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses related to the IPO, one-time public company transition expenses and costs associated with financing transactions, M&A activity, optimization and restructuring, technology transformation costs, and certain other costs affecting comparability, adjusted for the applicable tax rate. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares for the applicable period. We present Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding certain material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to net income (loss) applied in presenting Adjusted Net Income provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as Net Cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities minus purchases of property and equipment and purchases of intangible assets and capitalized software. We present Free Cash Flow because we believe it provides cash available for strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support ongoing business operations, and provides investors with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, costs consisted of $3.7 million of transaction costs and professional fees to support the merger with First Advantage, $3.1 million related to M&A activity for the acquisitions of Vault, A-Check, and Socrates, offset by a $2.7 million gain as a result of reassessing the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, costs consisted primarily of $1.9 million of M&A related costs for the acquisitions of Socrates and A-Check and $1.2 million of costs to support the Secondary Public Offering in June 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, costs consisted of $14.0 million of transaction costs and professional fees to support the merger with First Advantage, $5.8 million related to M&A activity for the acquisitions of Vault, A-Check, and Socrates, $4.0 million due to an out-of-period adjustment to the earn-out liability for the EBI acquisition, offset by a $2.7 million gain as a result of reassessing the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, costs consisted primarily of $4.6 million of M&A related costs for the acquisitions of Socrates and A-Check, $1.2 million of M&A costs for the EBI acquisition primarily due to the acceleration of contract costs related to the completion of the EBI platform migration, $2.5 million of registration statement costs, costs to support the Secondary Public Offering in June 2023, one-time public company transition expenses and expenses related to executing our interest rate swap.\n\n(2) Consists of restructuring-related costs, including executive recruiting and severance charges, and lease termination costs and disposal of fixed assets related to our real estate consolidation efforts. Beginning in 2020, we began executing a virtual-first strategy, closing offices and reducing office space globally. In 2022, we began executing on a restructuring program to realign senior leadership and functions with the goal of elevating our go-to-market strategy and accelerating our technology and product innovation. At the end of 2022, we also launched Project Nucleus which we expect to drive meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains in our cost of revenues. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, costs include $1.6 million of restructuring-related charges. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, costs consisted of $8.9 million in connection with executing against our real estate consolidation program which included a $5.3 million impairment charge on ROU assets, $1.9 million of accelerated rent and facilities costs, and $1.7 million of fixed asset disposals. The remaining $2.6 million consists of restructuring related charges to support our strategy refresh and the execution of Project Nucleus. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, costs include $4.6 million of restructuring-related charges and $0.2 million of fixed asset disposals in connection with office closures. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, costs consisted of $9.2 million of real estate consolidation costs and $5.5 million of restructuring-related charges.\n\n(3) Includes costs related to technology modernization, as well as costs related to decommissioning of on-premise production systems and redundant fulfillment systems of acquired companies and the migration to our platform. We believe that these costs are discrete and non-recurring in nature, as they relate to a one-time restructuring and decommissioning of our on-premise production systems and corporate technological infrastructure and the move to a managed service provider, decommissioning redundant fulfillment systems and modernizing internal functional systems. As such, they are not normal, recurring operating expenses and are not reflective of ongoing trends in the cost of doing business. The significant majority of these are related to the last two phases of Project Ignite, a three-phase strategic investment initiative launched in 2019 to create an enterprise-class global platform, with the remainder related to an investment made to modernize internal functional systems in preparation for our public company infrastructure. Phase two of Project Ignite was completed in 2022 and phase three of Project Ignite was completed in the first quarter of 2023. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, $0.5 million related to decommissioning of the redundant production and fulfillment systems of A-Check and the redundant production systems of Vault and integrating the fulfillment systems of Vault with Sterling to enhance the delivery of drug and health services. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, $0.2 million related to decommissioning of the redundant production and fulfillment systems of A-Check and the redundant fulfillment systems of Socrates. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, $0.8 million related to decommissioning of the redundant production and fulfillment systems of A-Check, the redundant fulfillment systems of Socrates, and the redundant production systems of Vault and integrating the fulfillment systems of Vault with Sterling to enhance the delivery of drug and health services. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, investment related to the conclusion of Project Ignite was $3.1 million and the remaining $0.3 million related to costs for decommissioning of the on-premise production system and decommissioning of the redundant fulfillment system of EBI and migrating onto our platform and decommissioning costs of the A-Check and Socrates systems.\n\n(4) Consists of non-recurring settlements and the related legal fees impacting comparability. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, costs include legal settlements totaling $1.0 million for certain settled legal litigation in the year or anticipated settlements based on claims existing as of the end of the reporting period. These legal settlement related costs were discrete and non-recurring in nature and we do not expect them to occur in future periods. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company did not incur costs related to non-recurring settlements and legal fees impacting comparability.\n\n(5) Consists of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and impairment of capitalized software.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of net (loss) income margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30,**| **Six Months Ended****June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (6,232)| $| 323| $| (14,187)| $| 914  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 46,284| $| 49,997| $| 84,794| $| 95,552  \nRevenues| $| 200,528| $| 190,384| $| 386,527| $| 369,658  \nNet (loss) income margin| (3.1)| %| 0.2| %| (3.7)| %| 0.2| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 23.1| %| 26.3| %| 21.9| %| 25.8| %  \n  \nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30,**| **Six Months Ended****June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (6,232| )| $| 323| $| (14,187| )| $| 914  \nIncome tax provision (benefit)| 7,094| (85| )| (1,924| )| 1,017  \nIncome (Loss) before income taxes| 862| 238| (16,111| )| 1,931  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets| 10,687| 10,625| 21,318| 20,686  \nStock-based compensation| 11,703| 9,358| 21,045| 17,401  \nTransaction expenses(1)| 4,120| 3,133| 21,108| 8,259  \nRestructuring(2)| 1,566| 11,490| 4,767| 14,763  \nTechnology transformation(3)| 455| 179| 830| 3,412  \nSettlements impacting comparability(4)| 1,000| —| 1,000| —  \nOther(5)| 615| 489| 110| 946  \nAdjusted Net Income before income tax effect| 31,008| 35,512| 54,067| 67,398  \nIncome tax effect(6)| 9,216| 9,308| 14,864| 17,908  \nAdjusted Net Income| $| 21,792| $| 26,204| $| 39,203| $| 49,490  \nNet (loss) income per share—basic| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.00| $| (0.16| )| $| 0.01  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.00| $| (0.16| )| $| 0.01  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—basic| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| $| 0.43| $| 0.53  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| $| 0.42| $| 0.52  \n  \n_________________________\n\n(1) Consists of transaction expenses related to M&A, associated earn-outs, one-time public company transition expenses and ancillary non-recurring public company expenses and fees associated with financing transactions.\n\n(2) Consists of restructuring-related costs, including executive recruiting and severance charges, and lease termination costs and disposal of fixed assets related to our real estate consolidation efforts.

Normalized effective tax rates of 27.5% and 26.6% have been used to compute Adjusted Net Income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.7 million for federal income tax purposes and deferred tax assets of approximately $5.6 million related to state and foreign income tax loss carryforwards available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The amount of actual cash taxes we pay for federal, state, and foreign income taxes differs significantly from the effective income tax rate computed in accordance with US GAAP, and from the normalized rate shown above.\n\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30,**| **Six Months Ended****June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (6,232| )| $| 323| $| (14,187| )| $| 914  \nLess: Undistributed amounts allocated to participating securities| —| —| —| —  \nUndistributed losses allocated to stockholders| $| (6,232| )| $| 323| $| (14,187| )| $| 914  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—basic| 92,778,209| 92,723,901| 91,526,151| 92,800,279  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—diluted| 92,778,209| 94,498,666| 91,526,151| 94,924,080  \nNet (loss) income per share—basic| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.00| $| (0.16| )| $| 0.01  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.00| $| (0.16| )| $| 0.01  \nAdjusted Net Income| $| 21,792| $| 26,204| $| 39,203| $| 49,490  \nLess: Undistributed amounts allocated to participating securities| —| —| —| —  \nUndistributed earnings allocated to stockholders| $| 21,792| $| 26,204| $| 39,203| $| 49,490  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—basic| 92,778,209| 92,723,901| 91,526,151| 92,800,279  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—diluted| 95,361,511| 94,498,666| 94,380,452| 94,924,080  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—basic| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| $| 0.43| $| 0.53  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| $| 0.42| $| 0.52  \n  \nThe following table presents the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30,**| **Six Months Ended****June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.00| $| (0.16| )| $| 0.01  \n _Adjusted Net Income adjustments per share_  \nIncome tax provision (benefit)| 0.07| 0.00| (0.02| )| 0.01  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets| 0.11| 0.11| 0.23| 0.22  \nStock-based compensation| 0.12| 0.10| 0.22| 0.18  \nTransaction expenses(1)| 0.04| 0.04| 0.22| 0.09  \nRestructuring(2)| 0.02| 0.12| 0.05| 0.16  \nTechnology transformation(3)| 0.01| 0.00| 0.01| 0.03  \nSettlements impacting comparability(4)| 0.01| 0.00| 0.01| 0.00  \nOther(5)| 0.01| 0.01| 0.01| 0.01  \nIncome tax effect(6)| (0.09| )| (0.10| )| (0.15| )| (0.19| )  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted| $| 0.23| $| 0.28| $| 0.42| $| 0.52  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding used in computation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share:  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—diluted (GAAP)| 92,778,209| 94,498,666| 91,526,151| 94,924,080  \nOptions not included in weighted average number of shares outstanding—diluted (GAAP) (using treasury stock method)| 2,583,302| —| 2,854,301| —  \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding—diluted (non-GAAP) (using treasury stock method)| 95,361,511| 94,498,666| 94,380,452| 94,924,080  \n  \n_________________________\n\n(1) Consists of transaction expenses related to M&A, associated earn-outs, one-time public company transition expenses and ancillary non-recurring public company expenses and fees associated with financing transactions.\n\n(2) Consists of restructuring-related costs, including executive recruiting and severance charges, and lease termination costs and disposal of fixed assets related to our real estate consolidation efforts. Beginning in 2020, we began executing a virtual-first strategy, closing offices and reducing office space globally. In 2022, we began executing on a restructuring program to realign senior leadership and functions with the goal of elevating our go-to-market strategy and accelerating our technology and product innovation. At the end of 2022, we also launched Project Nucleus which we expect to drive meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains in our cost of revenues.\n\n(3) Includes costs related to technology modernization, as well as costs related to decommissioning of on-premise production systems and redundant fulfillment systems of acquired companies and the migration to our platform. We believe that these costs are discrete and non-recurring in nature, as they relate to a one-time restructuring and decommissioning of our on-premise production systems and corporate technological infrastructure and the move to a managed service provider, decommissioning redundant fulfillment systems and modernizing internal functional systems. As such, they are not normal, recurring operating expenses and are not reflective of ongoing trends in the cost of doing business. The significant majority of these are related to the last two phases of Project Ignite, a three-phase strategic investment initiative launched in 2019 to create an enterprise-class global platform, with the remainder related to an investment made to modernize internal functional systems in preparation for our public company infrastructure. Phase two of Project Ignite was completed in 2022 and phase three of Project Ignite was completed in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n(4) Consists of non-recurring settlements and the related legal fees impacting comparability.\n\n(5) Consists of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and impairment of capitalized software.\n\n(6) Normalized effective tax rates of 29.7% and 26.2% have been used to compute Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(NASDAQ: STER) (“Sterling” or “the Company”) a leading global provider of technology-enabled background and identity verification services, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**First****Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\nAll results compared to prior-year period.\n\n  * Revenues increased 3.8% year-over-year to $186.0 million. Organic constant currency revenue decreased 4.9% and inorganic revenue growth was 8.7%. Organic revenue growth included growth of 11% year-over-year from the combination of new business, up/cross-sell, and customer attrition, offset by a 16% decline year-over-year in our base business.\n  * GAAP net (loss) income decreased year-over-year to a loss of $(8.0) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15.5% year-over-year to $38.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 470 bps year-over-year to 20.7%. Margin contraction was driven by increased volume from M&A activity at lower margins and higher third-party vendor costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by lower costs driven by our cost optimization efforts. The increase in third party vendor costs was driven by the combination of organic revenue growth in certain lower-margin product categories and revenue declines within our higher-margin base business.\n  * Adjusted Net Income decreased 25.2% year-over-year to $17.4 million. Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted decreased 20.8% year-over-year to $0.19 per diluted share.\n\n\n\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth (decline), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as applicable.\n\nJosh Peirez, Sterling CEO, said, “In the first quarter, Sterling started off the year with solid year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 4% including strong organic revenue trends within the revenue drivers in our control. We were particularly pleased to report year-over-year growth of 11% from the combination of new business, up/cross-sell, and customer attrition, well ahead of our 7-8% combined long-term target from those drivers. Our unrelenting focus on product innovation, customer service, and technology excellence continues to resonate with prospective and existing clients, and we remain in execution mode following our exciting February announcement of a combination with First Advantage. We were also proud of our inorganic revenue trends in the quarter, with both A-Check and Vault contributing at healthy levels to our top line growth as we march ahead with the synergistic deal integrations. At the same time, the hiring market backdrop remains challenging and drove year-over-year base business revenue declines, a dynamic we expect to moderate over the course of the year.\n\n“These top line factors had a dampening effect on our profitability during the first quarter. Specifically, our margins were impacted year-over-year by lower-margin inorganic revenue growth, particularly the Vault deal. Margins were also affected by the mix of our organic revenue growth including base revenue declines within higher-margin verticals and up-sell activity in certain lower-margin product categories. We expect margins to improve over the course of the year as we anticipate realizing additional synergies from M&A and improvement in base business. We also remain focused on our cost optimization efforts and saw margin benefits this quarter from our continued efforts to build a more streamlined, efficient cost structure throughout Sterling that will result in improved operational flexibility, profitability, and cash generation.”\n\n**First****Quarter****2024****Results**\n\n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, except per share data and percentages)**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenues| $| 185,999| $| 179,274| 3.8| %  \nNet (loss) income| $| (7,955| )| $| 591| (1,446.0| )%  \nNet (loss) income margin| (4.3| )%| 0.3| %| (460) bps  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.09| )| $| 0.01| (1,000.0| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| 38,510| $| 45,555| (15.5| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)| 20.7| %| 25.4| %| (470) bps  \nAdjusted Net Income(1)| $| 17,411| $| 23,286| (25.2| )%  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted(1)| $| 0.19| $| 0.24| (20.8)| %  \n  \n_______________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $186.0 million, an increase of $6.7 million, or 3.8%, compared to $179.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. The revenue increase for the first quarter of 2024 included a 4.9% organic constant currency revenue decline, offset by 8.7% inorganic revenue growth from the acquisitions of Socrates and A-Check.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $67.0 million and total debt was $559.2 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $54.2 million and total debt of $498.0 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting a revolving credit facility drawdown of $65.0 million for the acquisition of Vault Workforce Screening (“Vault”). Sterling ended the first quarter of 2024 with a net leverage ratio of 2.8x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 31, 2024, available borrowings under Sterling’s revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit outstanding, were $128.8 million.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Sterling generated net cash provided by operations of $3.7 million, compared to $11.3 million for the prior year period. Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $5.6 million, compared to $4.3 million for the prior year period. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Sterling had $(1.9) million of Free Cash Flow, compared to $7.0 million of Free Cash Flow for the prior year period. The decrease in Free Cash Flow compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by lower operating income and higher cash taxes paid.\n\nIn January 2024, Sterling acquired Vault for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $76.1 million.The purchase price was funded through a combination of revolving credit facility drawdown of $65.0 million and cash on hand, as well as an initial contingent consideration of $2.8 million recorded at fair value.\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure. Please see the schedule accompanying this earnings release for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operations, its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to combine with First Advantage Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“First Advantage”). In light of the pending merger with First Advantage, Sterling will not be hosting an earnings conference call to review its first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and it is intended that all forward-looking statements that we make will be subject to the safe harbor protections created thereby. Forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “will” or “would,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. In particular, statements that address market trends or projections about the future, and statements regarding Sterling’s expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, prospects or assumptions, or statements regarding future events or performance, including those related to our pending merger with First Advantage, contained in this release are forward-looking statements. Sterling has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. Such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Sterling’s control. Important factors relating to the proposed merger with First Advantage could also cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this release, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, (ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the proposed merger, including the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals and clearances, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed merger on Sterling’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (v) risks that the proposed merger disrupts current plans and operations of Sterling or First Advantage and creates potential difficulties in Sterling employee retention as a result of the proposed merger, (vi) risks related to diverting management’s attention from Sterling’s ongoing business operations, (vii) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed merger, (viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the proposed merger that may impact Sterling’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions and (ix) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against First Advantage or against Sterling related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed merger. These and other important factors, including those discussed more fully elsewhere in this release and in Sterling’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly Sterling’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, or could affect Sterling’s share price. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future performance and actual results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which Sterling operates, may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by law, Sterling does not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis release contains “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\n\nSpecifically, Sterling makes use of the non-GAAP financial measures “organic constant currency revenue growth (decline)”, “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted Net Income,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share” and “Free Cash Flow” to assess the performance of its business.\n\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth (decline) is calculated by adjusting for inorganic revenue growth (decline), which is defined as the impact to revenue growth (decline) in the current period from merger and acquisition (“M&A”) activity that has occurred over the past twelve months, and converting the current period revenue at foreign currency exchange rates consistent with the prior period. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisitions of Vault (acquired during the first quarter of 2024) as well as A-Check Global (“A-Check”) (acquired during the first quarter of 2023), and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisition of Socrates Limited and its affiliates (“Socrates”) (acquired in January 2023) as well as A-Check. We present organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; however, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such a measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) does not reflect M&A activity or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses related to the IPO, one-time public company transition expenses and costs associated with financing transactions, M&A activity, optimization and restructuring, technology transformation costs, foreign currency (gains) and losses and other costs affecting comparability. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable period. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate the factors and trends affecting our business to assess our financial performance and in preparing and approving our annual budget and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance. Further, our executive incentive compensation is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be considered only in conjunction with net income (loss) for the period. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP profitability measure. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses related to the IPO, one-time public company transition expenses and costs associated with financing transactions, M&A activity, optimization and restructuring, technology transformation costs, and certain other costs affecting comparability, adjusted for the applicable tax rate. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares for the applicable period. We present Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding certain material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to net income (loss) applied in presenting Adjusted Net Income provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as Net Cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities minus purchases of property and equipment and purchases of intangible assets and capitalized software. We present Free Cash Flow because we believe it provides cash available for strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support ongoing business operations, and provides investors with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisitions of Vault and A-Check. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we have provided the impact of revenue from the acquisitions of Socrates and A-Check.\n\n**Three Months Ended****March 31,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nReported revenue growth (decline)| 3.8| %| (6.6)| %  \nInorganic revenue growth(1)| 8.7| %| 1.5| %  \nImpact from foreign currency exchange(2)| —| %| (1.0)| %  \nOrganic constant currency revenue decline| (4.9)| %| (7.1)| %  \n  \n_______________________(1) Impact to revenue growth (decline) in the current period from M&A activity that has occurred over the past twelve months.\n\n(2) Impact to revenue growth (decline) in the current period from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****March 31,**  \n---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (7,955| )| $| 591  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision| (9,018| )| 1,102  \nInterest expense, net| 10,312| 8,608  \nDepreciation and amortization| 15,770| 15,122  \nStock-based compensation| 9,342| 8,043  \nTransaction expenses(1)| 16,988| 5,126  \nRestructuring(2)| 3,201| 3,273  \nTechnology transformation(3)| 375| 3,233  \nOther(4)| (505| )| 457  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 38,510| $| 45,555  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 20.7| %| 25.4| %  \n  \n_______________________(1) Consists of transaction expenses related to M&A, associated earn-outs, one-time public company transition expenses and ancillary non-recurring public company expenses and fees associated with financing transactions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, costs consisted of $10.3 million of transaction costs and professional fees to support the merger with First Advantage, $4.0 million due to an out-of-period adjustment to the earn-out liability for the EBI acquisition, and the remaining $2.7 million related to M&A activity for the acquisitions of Vault, A-Check, and Socrates. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, costs consisted primarily of $2.7 million of M&A related costs for the acquisitions of Socrates and A-Check, $1.1 million of M&A costs for the EBI acquisition primarily due to the acceleration of contract costs related to completion of the EBI platform migration and $1.3 million of registration statement costs, one-time public company transition expenses and expenses related to executing our interest rate swap.\n\n(2) Consists of restructuring-related costs, including executive recruiting and severance charges, and lease termination costs and disposal of fixed assets related to our real estate consolidation efforts. Beginning in 2020, we began executing a virtual-first strategy, closing offices and reducing office space globally. In 2022, we began executing on a restructuring program to realign senior leadership and functions with the goal of elevating our go-to-market strategy and accelerating our technology and product innovation. At the end of 2022, we also launched Project Nucleus which we expect to drive meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains in our cost of revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, costs include $3.0 million of restructuring-related charges and $0.2 million of fixed asset disposals in connection with office closures. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, costs consisted of $2.9 million of restructuring-related charges and $0.3 million of real estate consolidation costs.\n\n(3) Includes costs related to technology modernization, as well as costs related to decommissioning of on-premise production systems and redundant fulfillment systems of acquired companies and the migration to our platform. We believe that these costs are discrete and non-recurring in nature, as they relate to a one-time restructuring and decommissioning of our on-premise production systems and corporate technological infrastructure and the move to a managed service provider, decommissioning redundant fulfillment systems and modernizing internal functional systems. As such, they are not normal, recurring operating expenses and are not reflective of ongoing trends in the cost of doing business. The significant majority of these are related to the last two phases of Project Ignite, a three-phase strategic investment initiative launched in 2019 to create an enterprise-class global platform, with the remainder related to an investment made to modernize internal functional systems in preparation for our public company infrastructure. Phase two of Project Ignite was completed in 2022 and phase three of Project Ignite was completed in the first quarter of 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, $0.4 million related to decommissioning of the redundant production and fulfillment systems of A-Check, the redundant fulfillment systems of Socrates, the redundant production systems of Vault and integrating the fulfillment systems of Vault with Sterling to enhance the delivery of drug and health services. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, investment related to Project Ignite was approximately $3.1 million. The remaining $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 relates to costs for decommissioning of the on-premise production system and decommissioning of the redundant fulfillment system of EBI and migrating onto our platform.\n\n(4) Consists of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and impairment of capitalized software.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of net (loss) income margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****March 31,**  \n---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (7,955| )| $| 591  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 38,510| $| 45,555  \nRevenues| $| 185,999| $| 179,274  \nNet (loss) income Margin| (4.3| )%| 0.3| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 20.7| %| 25.4| %  \n  \nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended****March 31,**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (7,955| )| $| 591  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision| (9,018| )| 1,102  \nIncome (Loss) before income taxes| (16,973| )| 1,693  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets| 10,631| 10,061  \nStock-based compensation| 9,342| 8,043  \nTransaction expenses(1)| 16,988| 5,126  \nRestructuring(2)| 3,201| 3,273  \nTechnology transformation(3)| 375| 3,233  \nOther(4)| (505| )| 457  \nAdjusted Net Income before income tax effect| 23,059| 31,886  \nIncome tax effect(5)| 5,648| 8,600  \nAdjusted Net Income| $| 17,411| $| 23,286  \nNet (loss) income per share—basic| $| (0.09| )| $| 0.01  \nNet (loss) income per share—diluted| $| (0.09| )| $| 0.01  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—basic| $| 0.19| $| 0.25  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share—diluted| $| 0.19| $| 0.24  \n  \n_______________________(1) Consists of transaction expenses related to M&A, associated earn-outs, one-time public company transition expenses and ancillary non-recurring public company expenses and fees associated with financing transactions.\n\n(2) Consists of restructuring-related costs, including executive recruiting and severance charges, and lease termination costs and disposal of fixed assets related to our real estate consolidation efforts.
