(Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nLindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are thrilled to have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for Emrosi™, a potential best-in-class treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, which is a tremendous milestone for Fortress and our partner company, Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey Medical”). This marks the first FDA approval across the Fortress portfolio, and demonstrates our ability to successfully in-license a clinical stage program and develop it through commercialization. We could achieve up to two more U.S. FDA approvals in the next nine months, and our next anticipated PDUFA goal date is December 28, 2024, for cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”). We have an exciting late-stage pipeline with many upcoming value creation opportunities, and we are focused on attaining our long-term strategy of building shareholder value, while bringing innovative treatment options to patients with unmet medical needs.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights****1****:**\n\n_Regulatory Updates_\n\n  * In November 2024, the FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29. Emrosi has the potential to be the new treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is expected to launch late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2025 by our partner company, Journey Medical (Nasdaq: DERM).\n  * In July 2024, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Cosibelimab is currently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CKPT) (“Checkpoint”).\n  * In December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl Therapeutics (“Sentynl”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics (“Cyprium”), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101. \n\n\n\n_Clinical Updates_\n\n  * In October 2024, clinical data were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In September 2024, we presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. The longer-term results for cosibelimab demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.\n\n\n\n_Other Updates_\n\n  * In July 2024, we announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, our majority owned and controlled subsidiary company, Urica Therapeutics (“Urica”), entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement and related agreements with Crystalys Therapeutics (“Crystalys”). Urica transferred rights to dotinurad, its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity and granted Urica a securitized 3% royalty on future net sales of dotinurad.\n\n\n\n_Commercial Product Updates_\n\n  * Journey Medical’s net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $14.6 million, compared to net product revenues of $14.9 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**General Corporate:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint raised $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules.\n  * In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue in accordance with their terms; the pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should be lifted.\n  * Also in July 2024, Fortress reduced its total debt by entering into a new loan agreement maturing in July 2027 with funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), a leading global investment firm. The Company received an initial tranche of $35 million and is eligible to draw an additional $15 million with Oaktree’s consent. In connection with the new loan agreement, the Company repaid its prior term loan with Oaktree of $50 million resulting in an outstanding debt reduction of approximately $15 million of debt excluding accrued interest and prepayment fees.\n  * In September 2024, Fortress raised $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements.\n  * In October 2024, Mustang Bio raised $4 million in gross proceeds from the exercise of existing warrants.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in gross proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.9 million, compared to $76.2 million as of June 30, 2024, and compared to $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $17.3 million during the quarter and a decrease of $22.0 million year-to-date.\n  * Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents, totaling $58.9 million as of September 30, 2024, includes $25.6 million attributable to Fortress and the private subsidiaries, $2.6 million attributable to Avenue, $4.7 million attributable to Checkpoint, $3.5 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $22.5 million attributable to Journey Medical. \n    * Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, which included $40.6 million attributable to Fortress and private subsidiaries, $1.8 million attributable to Avenue, $4.9 million attributable to Checkpoint, $6.2 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $27.4 million attributable to Journey Medical.\n  * Fortress’ consolidated net revenue totaled $14.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, all of which was generated from our marketed dermatology products. This compares to consolidated revenue totaling $34.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, which included $15.3 million in revenue generated from our marketed dermatology products and an upfront license agreement payment of $19 million.\n  * Consolidated research and development expenses including license acquisitions totaled $9.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.3 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Consolidated selling, general and administrative costs were $22.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(15.0) million, or $(0.76) per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(7.1) million, or $(0.94) per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**About Fortress Biotech** Fortress Biotech, Inc.

(Nasdaq: ATXI) (“Avenue” or the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We have generated considerable momentum this past quarter in advancing our pipeline of innovative treatments for neurologic diseases,” said Alexandra MacLean, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avenue. “AJ201 is a potential best-in-class asset that would bring a disease-modifying therapeutic option to patients with significant unmet medical need in Kennedy’s Disease. Since dosing the last patient in the study in May, we continue to work diligently to move the study forward. We are looking forward to sharing topline clinical data in the coming months and building upon our progress of delivering impactful therapies to patients suffering from neurologic diseases.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n**AJ201** _(Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer for SBMA)_\n\n  * In May 2024, Avenue announced the last patient visit was complete in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), marking the final clinical milestone ahead of the anticipated topline data announcement around year-end 2024. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 enrolled 25 patients randomly assigned to AJ201 (600 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of AJ201 in subjects with clinically and genetically defined SBMA. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data measuring change from baseline in mutant AR protein levels in skeletal muscle and changes from baseline in expression of Nrf2-activated genes in skeletal muscle. Exploratory objectives of the study include changes in the fat and muscle composition as seen on MRI scans. These endpoints are believed to be biomarkers indicating likelihood for longer term clinical improvement. Further details about this study can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05517603). \n\n\n\n**BAER-101** _(GABA_ _A_ _α2/3 positive allosteric modulator)_\n\n  * Subject to the receipt of additional financing, Avenue plans to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of BAER-101 in patients with focal epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Preclinical mouse models have demonstrated BAER-101 as a therapeutic option with the ability to fully suppress seizure activity, with the effect being fast in onset and stable throughout the duration of testing. \n\n\n\n**IV Tramadol**\n\n  * Avenue has reached final agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on the safety study protocol and statistical analysis approach for the Phase 3 study of intravenous (“IV”) tramadol, which is being developed for the treatment of acute post-operative pain in a medically supervised setting. The proposed study will randomize approximately 300 post bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Patients will have access to IV hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. Avenue aims to initiate the Phase 3 safety study pending additional financing or a partnership. The Company believes that the study can be completed and submitted to the FDA within 12 months of the study’s initiation. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 million, compared to $4.9 million at June 30, 2024 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $0.8 million year-to-date.\n  * **R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.3 million, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **G &A Expenses: **General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $(3.1) million, or $(1.92) per share, compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $4.86 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Avenue Therapeutics** Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases. It is currently developing three assets including AJ201, a first-in-class asset for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, BAER-101, an oral small molecule selective GABAA α2, α3 receptor positive allosteric modulator for CNS diseases, and IV tramadol, which is in Phase 3 clinical development for the management of acute postoperative pain in adults in a medically supervised healthcare setting.

All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this press release, including statements that express our intentions, plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections made by management about our business, our industry and other conditions affecting our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause such outcomes and results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties arising from: the fact that we currently have no drug products for sale and that our success is dependent on our product candidates receiving regulatory approval and being successfully commercialized; the possibility that serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our current or future product candidates, such that we would need to abandon or limit development of some of our product candidates; our ability to successfully develop, partner, or commercialize any of our current or future product candidates including AJ201, IV tramadol, and BAER-101; the substantial doubt raised about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing; the significant losses we have incurred since inception and our expectation that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future; our need for substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which unavailability could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts; our reliance on third parties for several aspects of our operations; our reliance on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, or unacceptable to regulatory authorities; the possibility that we may not receive regulatory approval for any or all of our product candidates, or that such approval may be significantly delayed due to scientific or regulatory reasons; the fact that even if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, they will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny; the effects of current and future laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations; the effects of competition for our product candidates and the potential for new products to emerge that provide different or better therapeutic alternatives for our targeted indications; the possibility that the government or third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our product candidates or any future products; our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates; our exposure to potential product liability claims; related to the protection of our intellectual property and our potential inability to maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products; our ability to maintain compliance with the obligations under our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, without which licenses and arrangements we could lose rights that are important to our business; the fact that Fortress Biotech, Inc. controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and has rights to receive significant share grants annually; and those risks discussed in our filings which we make with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this press release, except as required by applicable law.

(“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates.\n\n“With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date set for next month, we await the decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our anti-programmed death ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) antibody,” said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. “The $9.2 million in cash proceeds received this month from the exercise of existing warrants has strengthened our balance sheet to extend beyond our PDUFA date and into 2025. We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and look forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”).”\n\n**Recent Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete response letter (“CRL”) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of action, with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million.\n  * In September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the [Publications page](https://checkpointtx.com/publications/) of Checkpoint’s website.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, year-to-date. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n  * **R &D Expenses**: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million, compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.9 million. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included $0.5 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **G &A Expenses**: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.4 million, compared to $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $1.2 million. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included $1.4 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.7 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included $1.9 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Checkpoint Therapeutics** Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers.

For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our resubmission of our BLA for cosibelimab and review thereof, our belief that the BLA resubmission potentially addresses all the issues in the CRL, our belief about the comprehensive nature of our BLA resubmission and reaching alignment with the FDA on our cosibelimab BLA resubmission strategy, our ability to work with our third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) and the FDA to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL and execute on a pathway forward for the potential marketing approval of cosibelimab, the adequacy of the responses to the inspection issues submitted to FDA by our third-party CMO, our projections of regulatory review timelines, the commercial potential of cosibelimab, if approved, and the potential differentiation of cosibelimab, including a potentially favorable safety profile as compared to the currently available anti-programmed death receptor-1 therapies and the dual mechanism of action of cosibelimab translating into potential enhanced efficacy. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with the regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the timeline of FDA review of the resubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory solution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at all during the review process for the BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information sufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our, and our third party CMO’s, ability to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL; issues associated with any facility inspection or re-inspection of our third party CMO or otherwise during the review process for the BLA; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with applicable regulations; whether the FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA resubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a partnering or other relationship to enable the commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved, on acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will be observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and analyzed; the risk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an application for approval of cosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results from the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory approval of cosibelimab to treat cSCC or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic agreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones we project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones. Further discussion about these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, and in our subsequent other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

This approval is a transformational milestone for both Journey Medical and the dermatology community, as Emrosi has the potential to become the best-in-class oral medication and standard of care to address inflammatory lesions of rosacea.”\n\nMr. Maraoui continued, “We also continued to commercialize our core dermatology products and experienced a solid third quarter of 2024, with $14.6 million in revenues. We look forward to continued growth with the anticipated launch of Emrosi in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * Total net product revenues were $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Qbrexza net product sales increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, from the same period in 2023, due to our focused marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms for the product offset by decreases in sales volume for the remainder of our products. \n  * Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driving a 6.0% increase in our gross product margin from 57.9% in the prior year quarter, to 63.9% for the third quarter of 2024. The gross margin increase was mainly due to inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease in product royalties from the same period in 2023. \n  * Research and development costs decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. \n  * Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from the same period in 2023 mainly due to increases in non-cash share-based compensation expenses and overall selling and marketing expenses, including our pre-launch expenses for Emrosi. \n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or $(0.12) per share basic and diluted, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.91 per share basic and $0.80 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Our non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share basic and diluted, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, or $1.13 per share basic and $0.99 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under “ _Use of Non-GAAP Measures_.” \n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $23.9 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * In November 2024, the U.S. FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.\n  * In October 2024, clinical data was presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral Doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In July 2024, Journey Medical appointed Michael C. Pearce to its Board of Directors. Mr. Pearce is an accomplished executive, with substantial strategic, business and financial experience across many industries, including healthcare. \n\n\n\n**About Journey Medical Corporation** Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical”) is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions through its efficient sales and marketing model.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, severance, short-term research and development expense and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below:\n\n  * _Share-Based Compensation Expense_ : We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued.\n  * _Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense_ : We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with Emrosi, formerly referred to as DFD-29, including the filing fee payment made to the FDA and contractual milestone payments, which was the only product in our portfolio not approved for marketing and sale during the reporting period, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies.\n  * _Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible Assets_ : We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets. \n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis.\n\nManagement believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures:\n\n**JOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**  \n($ in thousands except for share and per share amounts)  \n**Three-Month Periods Ended** | **Nine-Month Periods Ended**  \n**September 30** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Net Loss** | **$** | **(2,390** | **)** | **$** | **16,789** | **$** | **(16,193** | **)** | **$** | **(1,710** | **)**  \n**EBITDA:**  \nInterest | 570 | 260 | 1,303 | 1,465  \nTaxes | - | 95 | - | 95  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets | 814 | 814 | 2,443 | 2,952  \n**EBITDA** | **(1,006** | **)** | **17,958** | **(12,447** | **)** | **2,802**  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:**  \n**Non-Cash Components:**  \nShare-based compensation | 1,640 | 558 | 4,720 | 2,077  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | (1,125 | ) | - | (1,125 | ) | -  \nLoss on impairment of intangible assets | - | - | - | 3,143  \n**Non-core & Infrequent Components:**  \nShort-term R&D (includes one-time DFD-29 license and milestone payments) | 692 | 2,206 | 9,173 | 5,949  \nForeign exchange transaction losses | 51 | 100 | 104 | 181  \nSeverance | - | - | 147 | 711  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **252** | **$** | **20,822** | **$** | **572** | **$** | **14,863**  \n**Net income (loss) & Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA per common share:**  \n**Basic**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.91 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 1.13 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.82  \n**Diluted**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.80 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 0.99 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.72  \n**Weighted average number of common shares:**  \nGAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nGAAP - Diluted | 20,537,794 | 21,034,758 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Diluted | 24,762,014 | 21,034,758 | 24,263,348 | 20,588,661  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d/small/journeylogo-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d)\n\nSource: Journey Medical Corporation \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n"

(Nasdaq: FBIO)\n(“Fortress”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing\nassets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity\nholdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent\ncorporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nLindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer,\nsaid, “We are thrilled to have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval\nfor Emrosi™, a potential best-in-class treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in\nadults, which is a tremendous milestone for Fortress and our partner company, Journey\nMedical Corporation (“Journey Medical”). This marks the first FDA approval across the\nFortress portfolio, and demonstrates our ability to successfully in-license a clinical stage\nprogram and develop it through commercialization. We could achieve up to two more U.S.\nFDA approvals in the next nine months, and our next anticipated PDUFA goal date is\nDecember 28, 2024, for cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of metastatic\nor locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”). We have an exciting late-\nstage pipeline with many upcoming value creation opportunities, and we are focused on\nattaining our long-term strategy of building shareholder value, while bringing innovative\ntreatment options to patients with unmet medical needs.”\nRecent Corporate Highlights1:\nRegulatory Updates\nIn November 2024, the FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-\nRelease Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29. Emrosi has the potential to be the\nnew treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from inflammatory lesions\nof rosacea. The treatment is expected to launch late in the first quarter or early in the\nsecond quarter of 2025 by our partner company, Journey Medical (Nasdaq: DERM).\nIn July 2024, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission\nfor cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients\nwith metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery\nor radiation and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Cosibelimab is\ncurrently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics (Nasdaq:\nCKPT) (“Checkpoint”).\nIn December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate\nfor Menkes disease) to Sentynl Therapeutics (“Sentynl”), a wholly owned subsidiary of\nZydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl completed the rolling submission of the New Drug\nApplication for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics\n(“Cyprium”), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100%\nownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval\nfor CUTX-101.\nClinical Updates\nIn October 2024, clinical data were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology\nConference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus\noral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-\nrelease formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline\nfrom day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful\nimpact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3\nclinical trials.\nIn September 2024, we presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab\nin locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical\nOncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. The longer-term results for cosibelimab\ndemonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and\ncomplete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.\nOther Updates\nIn July 2024, we announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic\npotential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous\nCytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and\nnatural killer T cells.\nAlso in July 2024, our majority owned and controlled subsidiary company, Urica\nTherapeutics (“Urica”), entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement\nand related agreements with Crystalys Therapeutics (“Crystalys”). Urica transferred\nrights to dotinurad, its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the\ntreatment of gout, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to\nCrystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35%\nof Crystalys’ outstanding equity and granted Urica a securitized 3% royalty on future\nnet sales of dotinurad.\nCommercial Product Updates\nJourney Medical’s net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30,\n2024 were $14.6 million, compared to net product revenues of $14.9 million for the\nsecond quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nGeneral Corporate:\nIn July 2024, Checkpoint raised $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at-the-\nmarket under Nasdaq rules.\nIn July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the\nCompany’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the\n“Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the\ndividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain\nfinancial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points.

The risks described below are a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, the risk factors described in Item 1A, and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As used below and throughout this filing (including in the risk factors described in Item 1A), the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress Biotech, Inc. individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context.\n\n​\n\n**Risks Inherent in Drug Development**\n\n​\n\n●| Many of our product candidates are in early development stages and are subject to time and cost intensive regulation and clinical testing, which may result in the identification of safety or efficacy concerns. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully developed or commercialized.   \n---|---  \n●| Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’ commercial opportunity and profitability.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities**\n\n​\n\n●| We have a history of operating losses and expect such losses to continue in the future.   \n---|---  \n●| We have funded our operations in part through the assumption of debt, and the applicable lending agreements may restrict our operations. Further, the occurrence of any default event under an applicable loan document could adversely affect our business.  \n---|---  \n●| Our research and development (“R&D”) programs will require additional capital, which we may be unable to raise as needed and which may impede our R&D programs, commercialization efforts, or planned acquisitions.   \n---|---  \n●| Our board of directors has paused payments of dividends on our preferred stock, and there can be no assurance that monthly dividend payments will be resumed in a timely manner, or at all.  \n---|---  \n●| If we raise additional capital by issuing equity, equity-linked securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities, our existing stockholders will be diluted.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey”)**\n\n​\n\n●| Our operating income derives primarily from the sale of our partner company Journey’s dermatology products, particularly Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq and Zilxi. Any issues relating to the manufacture, sale, utilization, or reimbursement of Journey’s products (including products liability claims) could significantly impact our operating results.   \n---|---  \n●| A significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. Three of Journey’s marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, as well as Emrosi, a modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea licensed from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, for which we recently obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval, currently have patent protection. Four of Journey’s marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. With respect to Journey products that are covered by valid claims of issued patents, such patents may be subject to invalidation, which would harm our operating income.  \n---|---  \n●| Continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of current and newly approved therapeutics.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization**\n\n​\n\n●| We have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| We and our subsidiaries and partner companies have also entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, arrangements under which we and/or they have agreed to contingent dispositions of such companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. The consummation of any such arrangements with respect to certain product candidates may also result in our eligibility to receive a lower portion of sales (if any) of resulting approved products than if we had developed and commercialized such products ourselves.  \n---|---  \n●| Our growth and success depend on our acquiring or in-licensing products or product candidates and integrating such products into our businesses.  \n---|---  \n●| We act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of certain obligations of our subsidiaries, partner companies and partners, which could require us to pay substantial amounts based on the actions or omissions of said entities.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties**\n\n​\n\n●| We rely heavily on third parties for several aspects of our operations, including manufacturing and developing product candidates, conducting clinical trials, and producing commercial product supply. Such reliance on third parties reduces our ability to control every aspect of the drug development process and may hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof**\n\n​\n\n●| If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technologies and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technologies and products may be impaired.  \n---|---  \n●| We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or to enforce our or our licensors’ patents.   \n---|---  \n●| Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation**\n\n​\n\n●| Generic drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products.  \n---|---  \n●| In connection with these applications, generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation and/or with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). Such challenges may subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and/or PTO proceedings.  \n---|---  \n●| As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or PTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic competitor of our products, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of product sales in a short period of time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates**\n\n​\n\n●| If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such products are likely to be limited.   \n---|---  \n●| We may not obtain the desired product labels or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications desirable to successfully promote our products.  \n---|---  \n●| Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical trials, the results of which could cause such products to later be withdrawn from the market.  \n---|---  \n●| Any successful products liability claim related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur substantial liability and limit the commercialization of such products.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries**\n\n​\n\n●| We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or executive action may have on our operations.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**General and Other Risks**\n\n​\n\n●| We have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), and if we again are unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART I.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n1. Organization and Description of Business\n\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holding and dividend and royalty revenue streams. Fortress works in concert with its extensive network of key opinion leaders to identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for potential acquisition. The Company has executed such arrangements in partnership with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, AstraZeneca plc and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\n\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress leverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary companies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and development, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four partner companies are publicly-traded, and three subsidiaries have consummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including AstraZeneca plc as successor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”). \n\nOur subsidiaries and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and product candidates are: Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic”, a subsidiary of Avenue), Cellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc. (“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO, “Mustang”) and Oncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”). \n\nAs used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context. Generally, “subsidiary” refers to a private Fortress subsidiary, “partner company” refers to a public Fortress subsidiary, and “partner” refers to an entity with whom one of the foregoing parties has a significant business relationship, such as an exclusive license or an ongoing product-related payment obligation. The context in which any such term is used throughout this document, however, may dictate a different construal from the foregoing.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSince inception, the Company’s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sale of subsidiaries/partner companies, and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants. The Company has incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the next several years as it continues to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for its existing and new product candidates. Current cash and cash equivalents of $25.6 million for Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress (“Parent Entity”) are considered sufficient to fund the Parent Entity’s operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company will need to raise additional funding through strategic relationships, public or private equity or debt financings, sale of partner companies, grants or other arrangements to develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for the existing and new product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for the potential products, sales and marketing capabilities. If such funding is not available or not available on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company’s current development plans and plans for expansion of its general and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. Fortress also has the ability, subject to limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and other applicable laws and regulations, to raise money from the sale of common stock of the public companies in which it has ownership positions. \n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statement results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future period.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year for each of Avenue, Checkpoint, Mustang and Journey. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), from which the Company derived the balance sheet data at December 31, 2023, as well as Checkpoint’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024, Mustang’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, Avenue’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, and Journey’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as calculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s significant estimates include, but are not limited to provisions for coupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, specialty pharmacy discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, inventory realization, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock options and warrants, stock-based compensation, common stock issued to acquire licenses, accrued expenses and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n**Restricted Cash**\n\nThe Company records cash held in trust or pledged to secure certain debt obligations as restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of restricted cash representing pledges to secure debt obligations and letters of credit in connection with certain office leases, and an undertaking posted by Cyprium to secure potential damages in an injunctive proceeding. \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as of the dates presented:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $|  58,853| $|  72,307  \nRestricted cash| ​|  2,063| ​|  2,438  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  60,916| ​| $|  74,745  \n  \n​\n\n**Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K other than the following:\n\nAssets Held for Sale\n\nAssets held for sale represent assets that have met the criteria of “held for sale” accounting, as specified by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Long-lived Assets.” As of September 30, 2024, there are $2.2 million of lab and cell processing equipment, furniture and fixtures and computer equipment that are recorded as assets held for sale. The effect of suspending depreciation on the assets held for sale is immaterial to the results of operations. The assets held for sale are part of Mustang’s repurchase of assets from uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc. (“uBriGene”) (see Note 3). \n\n​\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n _Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ , which requires that an entity report segment information in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendment in the ASU is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ , which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, _Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses_ , which requires new financial statement disclosures in tabular format, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments in this update do not change or remove current expense disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

Asset Purchase Agreements\n\nMustang\n\nAgreements with uBriGene \n\nOn May 18, 2023, Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to which Mustang agreed to sell its leasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Facility”), and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to uBriGene (the “Transaction”). Mustang and uBriGene subsequently entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2023 (“Amendment No. 1”), and Amendment No. 2 to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 28, 2023 (“Amendment No. 2,” and together with the Original Asset Purchase Agreement and Amendment No. 1, the “Prior Asset Purchase Agreement”).\n\nOn July 28, 2023, pursuant to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang completed the sale of all of its assets that primarily relate to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (such operations, the “Transferred Operations” and such assets, the “Transferred Assets”) to uBriGene for upfront consideration of $6 million cash (the “Base Amount”). The Transferred Assets included all of Mustang’s assets, except for Mustang’s lease and related leasehold improvements of the Facility and contracts that are primarily used in the Transferred Operations. Mustang recorded a gain of $1.4 million in connection with the sale of the Transferred Assets and recorded approximately $0.3 million of the base consideration as deferred income, that was to be recognized upon the transfer of the lease.\n\nIn connection with the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene submitted a voluntary joint notice to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). Following CFIUS’s review and subsequent investigation of the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, on May 13, 2024, Mustang, together with uBriGene and CFIUS, executed a National Security Agreement (the “NSA”), pursuant to which Mustang and uBriGene agreed to abandon the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith. The NSA obligated uBriGene and Mustang to terminate agreements between the two parties, including the Manufacturing Services Agreement, Quality Services Agreement, and Subcontracting CDMO Agreement. In addition, uBriGene must sell, or otherwise dispose of, the equipment assets purchased within 180 days after the execution of the NSA.\n\nJune 2024 Repurchase of Assets\n\nOn June 27, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to which Mustang agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to repurchase the Transferred Assets, primarily lab equipment and supplies (collectively, the “Repurchased Assets”). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene also terminated existing manufacturing and services agreements.\n\nAs consideration for the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang has agreed to pay to uBriGene a total purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1.4 million, consisting of (i) an upfront payment of $0.1 million due within five (5) business days of the Effective Date and a (ii) subsequent amount of $1.3 million due on the date that is twelve (12) months after the closing date (the “Deferred Amount”). In the event that as of the original (or any extended) date on which the Deferred Amount is payable, Mustang has, as of the date of the public reporting of its then-most recent quarterly audited or unaudited financial statements, net assets below $20 million, then Mustang may, upon written notice to uBriGene, elect to delay its payment obligation of the Deferred Amount by an additional six (6) months, with no limit on the number of such extensions available to Mustang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mustang has not paid the Deferred Amount in full as of the date that is twelve (12) months after closing of the Repurchase Agreement, any amounts that remain outstanding will accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum beginning on the date that is twelve (12) months after closing and until the Deferred Amount is paid in full. Additionally, in connection with the termination of the agreements described above under the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang agreed to forgive a net receivable from uBriGene of approximately $3.3 million, comprised of outstanding receivables of $6.9 million and payables of $3.6 million, resulting in total purchase consideration in the Repurchase Transactions of approximately $4.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, the $1.3 million Purchase Price was recorded in Accrued Expenses - Other (see Note 10). As of September 30, 2024, the disposal group continues to be held for sale.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nMustang allocated the total purchase consideration of $4.7 million to the Repurchased Assets on a relative fair value basis. Mustang used a third-party to perform a valuation of the repurchased equipment, which resulted in a fair value less costs to sell of approximately $2.2 million. The remaining purchase consideration of $2.5 million was allocated to the supplies repurchased. The supplies repurchased with no alternative future use were recognized as research and development expense in an amount of $2.2 million. Repurchased supplies with an alternative future use of $0.3 million were also recognized in research and development expense, as Mustang does not have plans to resume operations in the facility, and it intends to dispose of the supplies in a single transaction with the equipment. Mustang concluded that the disposal group, which includes the repurchased equipment assets and associated supplies with an aggregate value of approximately $2.2 million, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the date of acquisition.\n\n​\n\nUrica\n\n​\n\nOn July 15, 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”), royalty agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”), and related agreements (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2022 and seeded by life sciences institutional investors. Under the Transaction Documents, Urica sold the rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, dotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity. Urica’s equity position cannot be reduced below 15% of Crystalys’ fully-diluted equity capitalization until it raises $150 million in equity securities. \n\n​\n\nThe Transaction Documents also grant Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, as well as the right to receive $0.6 million cash reimbursement for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad. Urica has the right to appoint one director to the board of directors of Crystalys, as well as an additional board observer. Crystalys is obliged to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize dotinurad. \n\n​\n\nThe APA also gives Urica the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the sold assets for a repurchase price not to exceed $6.4 million plus accrued interest; the repurchase option expires upon the consummation by Crystalys of a qualified financing of at least $120 million occurring within the earlier to occur of (i) twelve months after receipt by Crystalys of minutes from an anticipated FDA meeting; or (ii) July 15, 2026. Urica recorded a liability for the $0.6 million received, which will be accreted up to the repurchase price over the term of the repurchase option, and will not recognize an asset for its ownership interest received in Crystalys until the expiration of the repurchase option. Accordingly, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Urica recorded accretion of $0.3 million of the repurchase option price, booked to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\n​\n\nAvenue \n\n​\n\nInvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“InvaGen”) Share Repurchase\n\nUnder the Share Repurchase Agreement between Avenue and InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“InvaGen”) under which Avenue repurchased all of InvaGen’s shares in Avenue, Avenue agreed to pay InvaGen an additional amount as a contingent fee, payable in the form of seven and a half percent (7.5%) of the net proceeds of future financings, until $4.0 million in the aggregate is paid to InvaGen. In connection with equity financings in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Avenue made payments totaling $0.7 million to InvaGen.\n\n**4.

Fortress’ depreciation expense is recorded in both research and development expense and general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\n​\n\n _Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_\n\n​\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mustang concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain leasehold improvements and the related right of use asset. Mustang assessed the carrying value of the asset group consisting of the leasehold improvements and right-of-use asset in accordance with ASC 360, given the significant changes to Mustang’s operations, operating cash and the repurchase of equipment. The assessment of the recoverability of the asset group concluded that there was impairment on the carrying value of the asset group of approximately $2.6 million, which was allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of the assets. Approximately $2.2 million of the impairment loss was allocated to leasehold improvements, with the remaining $0.4 million allocated to the right-of-use asset. \n\n​\n\n6.

As such, the purchase price of any licenses acquired is classified as research and development-licenses acquired in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\nJourney\n\nIn June 2021, Journey entered a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement (the “DFD-29 Agreement”) to obtain global rights for the development and commercialization of EmrosiTM (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29, for the treatment of rosacea with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd (“DRL”); provided, that DRL retained certain rights to the program in select markets including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the DFD-29 Agreement, Journey paid $10.0 million. Based on the development and commercialization of Emrosi, additional contingent regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $140.0 million, which excludes a $15.0 million milestone payment triggered by FDA approval on November 4, 2024, may also become payable by Journey (see Note 19).

The Company borrowed $35.0 million under the New Oaktree Agreement on the Closing Date (the “2024 Oaktree Note”) and is eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million at the lenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. The 2024 Oaktree Note replaces the 2020 Oaktree Note (as defined below) in which the remaining $50.0 million balance was repaid in full.\n\nUnder the terms of the New Oaktree Agreement, the loans have a 30-month interest-only period with a maturity date of July 25, 2027, and bear interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 7.625% (subject to a 2.50% SOFR floor and a 5.75% SOFR cap). For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the interest rate applicable to the 2024 Oaktree Note was 12.91%. The Company is required to make quarterly interest-only payments until the maturity date, except fifty percent of the then-outstanding principal balance of the loans is due on March 31, 2027, with the remaining principal amount due on the maturity date.\n\nThe Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the amounts due under the New Oaktree Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment fee. Subject to prior written notice by the Company, to repay any amounts due prior to the maturity date, the Company must pay the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (B) any accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (C) any applicable Yield Protection Premium (as defined in the New Oaktree Agreement) and (D) if applicable, other unpaid amounts then due and owing pursuant to the New Oaktree Agreement and the other loan documents (such aggregate amount, the “Prepayment Price”); provided that each partial prepayment of the principal amount of the Loans shall be in an aggregate amount of at least $5.0 million and integral multiples of $1.0 million in excess thereof. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of the Loans with net cash proceeds from (i) certain casualty events, (ii) certain monetization events, including, among other things, certain asset sales and the sale(s) of priority review vouchers by certain subsidiaries of the Company, and the receipt by the Company of any dividend or other distributions in cash from any of its subsidiaries in excess of $5.0 million other than in connection with certain monetization events, (iii) debt issuances that are not permitted, and (iv) failure to comply with certain covenants. The lenders may elect to receive warrants to purchase common stock of the Company as an alternative to cash prepayments in some situations where a mandatory prepayment would otherwise be required. No mandatory prepayments were required in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that the Company maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (“the “Liquidity Requirement”), and (ii) that product net sales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month basis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain exclusions. Due to the approval of Emrosi, the minimum net sales amount will increase by $7.5 million each quarter, beginning in the third quarter of 2025, provided that the minimum net sales amount will in no event exceed $80.0 million. Both the Minimum Net Sales Test and the Liquidity Requirement will be reduced to $0 while the outstanding principal balance is less than or equal to $10.0 million. The Liquidity Requirement decreases to $5.0 million while the outstanding principal balance is between $10.0 million and $25.0 million. Failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test. \n\n​\n\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains events of default that are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure periods. In addition, the Company is also required to (i) raise common equity, or receive in monetizations or distributions, by the end of each calendar year prior to the maturity date, in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $20 million or 50% of an amount set forth in an annual budget delivered to the lenders and (ii) maintain a specified minimum equity stake in Journey. The capital raise and minimum stake covenants and financial covenants will not apply if the outstanding principal balance of the loan is less than or equal to $10 million. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable, the Agent will have the right upon notice to accelerate all amounts outstanding under the New Oaktree Agreement, in addition to other remedies available to the lenders as secured creditors of the Company.\n\nIn connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted a security interest in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the lenders, in substantially all of the Company’s assets, subject to customary exceptions, as collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the New Oaktree Agreement.\n\nAlso in connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted warrants to the lenders to purchase up to 506,390 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $2.0735 per share (the “Warrants”). The Warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including for share splits, share dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The exercise price of the Warrants will also be adjusted if, while the Warrants are outstanding, the Company engages in any transaction involving the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock or equivalent securities at an effective price per share less than the exercise price of the Warrant then in effect (such lower price, the “Base Share Price”). In such case, the exercise price of the Warrants will be reduced to equal the Base Share Price. The Warrants are exercisable from July 25, 2024 and will expire on July 25, 2031 and may be net exercised for no cash payment at the holder’s election. The Company filed a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of Company common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (see Note 13).\n\n​\n\nThe Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the New Oaktree Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n _2020 Oaktree Note_\n\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company’s $50.0 million outstanding balance of the senior secured credit agreement with Oaktree (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the “2020 Oaktree Note”) was terminated upon receipt by Oaktree of a payoff amount of $51.4 million from the Company comprised of principal, interest and the applicable final payment amount. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.6 million, representing unamortized debt issuance costs and inclusive of a $1.0 million prepayment fee. The payoff of the 2020 Oaktree Note was treated as a debt extinguishment, as the 2024 Oaktree Note originated from a fund group different from the Prior Oaktree Agreement.\n\n​\n\nThe Company had entered the Prior Oaktree Agreement in August 2020. The Prior Oaktree Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as certain financial covenants, including, among other things, (i) maintenance of minimum liquidity and (ii) a minimum revenue test that required Journey’s annual revenue to be equal to or to exceed annual revenue projections set forth in the Prior Oaktree Agreement. Failure by the Company or Journey, as applicable, to comply with the Prior Oaktree Agreement covenants would result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company.\n\n​\n\nThe Company was required to make quarterly interest-only payments until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2020 Oaktree Note, August 27, 2025, at which point the outstanding principal amount would have been due. The Company could have voluntarily prepaid the 2020 Oaktree Note at any time subject to a prepayment fee. The Company was required to make mandatory prepayments of the 2020 Oaktree Note under various circumstances as defined in the Prior Oaktree Agreement. \n\n​\n\n _SWK Term Loan_\n\n​\n\nOn December 27, 2023 (the “SWK Closing Date”), Journey entered into a Credit Agreement with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility (the “Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the SWK Closing Date, Journey drew $15 million. On June 26, 2024, Journey drew the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility. Loans under the Credit Facility (the “Term Loans”) mature on December 27, 2027. The Term Loans accrue interest which is payable quarterly in arrears. The Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term SOFR (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets quarterly. Interest payments began in February 2024 and are paid quarterly. \n\nOn July 9, 2024, Journey entered into an amendment (the “SWK Amendment”) to the Credit Facility. The SWK Amendment increased the total amount available under the Credit Facility from $20.0 million to $25.0 million. The $5.0 million available under the SWK Amendment is contractually required to be drawn upon FDA approval of Journey’s DFD-29 product candidate, Emrosi,subject to Journey receiving such approval on or before June 30, 2025. The FDA approved Emrosi on November 4, 2024 (see Note 19).\n\nBeginning in February 2026, Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date. If the total revenue of Journey, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, is greater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, the principal repayment start date is extended from February 2026 to February 2027, at which point Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 15% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date.\n\nJourney may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in whole or in part. Prepayment of the Term Loans is subject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2% of the Term Loans prepaid plus the amount of interest that would have been due through the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date if the Term Loans are prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, (ii) 1% of the Term Loans prepaid if the Term Loans are prepaid on or after the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date but prior to the second anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, or (iii) 0% if prepaid thereafter. \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nUpon repayment in full of the Term Loans, Journey will pay an exit fee equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. Additionally, Journey paid an origination fee of $0.2 million on the SWK Closing Date and incurred issuance costs of $0.2 million, both of which have been recorded as a debt discount. Journey is accreting the carrying value of the SWK Term Loan to the original principal balance plus the exit fee over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount is accounted for as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The effective interest rate on the SWK Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 was 14.9%. \n\nThe SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all assets of Journey. As of September 30, 2024, Journey was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK Credit Facility.\n\n_Urica_ _8 %__Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Offering_\n\nIn December 2022 and February 2023, Urica closed private offerings of its 8% Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Stock (the “Urica Preferred Stock”), at a price of $25.00 per share (“Subscription Price”) pursuant to which it sold a total of 135,494 shares of Urica Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $3.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million (the “Urica Offering”). A non-cash contingent warrant value of $0.1 million was also recorded in debt discount (see Note 6).\n\nDividends on the Urica Preferred Stock were payable monthly by Fortress in shares of Fortress common stock based upon a 7.5% discount to the average closing price over the 10-day period preceding the dividend payment date. Dividends were recorded as interest expense. For the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of nil and $0.1 million associated with the Urica dividends and for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, associated with the Urica dividends.\n\nThe shares mandatorily converted into Urica common stock upon either: (i) a qualified financing pursuant to which Urica raises at least $20 million in aggregate gross proceeds; or (ii) a sale of Urica. Additionally, in the event that neither such a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica had occurred prior to June 27, 2024, then each holder of Urica Preferred Stock was eligible to receive, at Fortress’ election, one of: (x) a cash payment equal to the product of the Subscription Price and the number of shares of Urica Preferred Stock held by such holder; (y) a number of shares of Fortress common stock equal to the Fortress Share Exchange Amount (as defined in the applicable instrument); or (z) a combination of the foregoing. On June 27, 2024, as neither a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica occurred, Fortress elected to exchange the outstanding shares of Urica Preferred Stock, which was recorded as a liability, into 2,028,345 shares of Fortress common stock. \n\n​\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nInterest expense includes contractual interest, and fees include amortization of the debt discount and amortization of fees associated with loan transaction costs, amortized over the life of the loan.

(“Sun”) pursuant to the Ximino asset purchase agreement. Journey owed $3.0 million of license installment payments to Sun associated with the license of Ximino. Pursuant to the Ximino Settlement Agreement, Journey agreed to settle the total outstanding obligation owed to Sun for a total of $1.9 million, payable in three installments: (1) $0.6 million upon execution of the Ximino Settlement Agreement, (2) $0.6 million on December 1, 2024, and (3) $0.6 million on January 15, 2025. Journey accounted for the settlement of the license installment payment as a gain of $1.1 million for the difference between the carrying value of the license installment payments of $3.0 million and the settlement amount of $1.9 million. The Company recorded the difference of $1.1 million as a gain on extinguishment of debt, which is included in Other income on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n11. Non-Controlling Interests \n\nThe Company’s ownership interests in its consolidated subsidiaries at September 30, 2024 was similar to December 31, 2023, except for Mustang which decreased from 19.0% to 7.4%.\n\n​\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n12. Net Loss per Common Share \n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributed to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributed to Fortress, less the Series A Preferred dividends and adjusted for subsidiary deemed dividends, by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period, not including unvested restricted stock, and without consideration for Common Stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share due to net losses in all periods. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted and basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company were identical since potential common shares were excluded from the calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive. nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of net loss per common share:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**  \nWarrants to purchase Common Stock|  14,499,535|  127,296  \nOptions to purchase Common Stock|  558,896|  160,233  \nUnvested Restricted Stock|  1,628,082|  1,338,750  \nUnvested Restricted Stock Units|  166,160|  106,708  \nTotal|  16,852,673|  1,732,987  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\n\n _9.375 %__Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Dividends_\n\n​\n\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). In accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should be lifted.\n\n​\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total undeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on September 30, 2024. Dividends in arrears that have not been declared by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets but are reflected in the net loss attributable to common shareholders (see Note 12).\n\n​\n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had the following equity compensation plans: the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2013 Plan”), the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) and the Fortress Biotech, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). In May 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Plan to increase the number of authorized shares issuable by 10.0 million shares, and approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares issuable by 1.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 10.0 million shares are available for issuance under the 2013 Plan, and approximately 1.0 million shares are available for issuance under the ESPP. \n\n​\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

Oaktree is entitled to a reduction in exercise price if, at any time prior to the expiration of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants, the Company issues equity, warrants or convertible notes (collectively known as “Security Instruments”) at a price that is less than 95% of the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the trading day prior to the issuance of the Security Instruments. As a result of the September 2024 registered direct offering (see Note 13), the exercise price on the 2024 Oaktree warrants was lowered to $1.65 per share, and recorded approximately $20,000 expense to interest expense.\n\n​\n\nThe Company evaluated the accounting treatment of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants and determined that the 2024 Oaktree warrants met the scope exception of _ASC 815-10-15-74(a) Derivatives and Hedging_ and therefore the warrants should be classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the Company used a Black-Scholes model to value the Oaktree Warrants. Utilizing the following inputs: term of 7 years, volatility of 90.52%, risk-free rate of return of 4.18% yielding a value of $1.3 million. _ASC 470-20-25-2 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options_ dictates that debt or stock issued with detachable warrants requires the proceeds to be allocated to the two instruments based on their relative fair values. The relative fair value of the warrants was determined to be $1.3 million and was recorded as a component of Stockholders’ Equity in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. \n\n​\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nIn connection with the 2020 Oaktree Note (see Note 9), in August 2020 the Company had issued warrants to Oaktree and certain of its affiliates to purchase up to approximately 0.1 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.14 per share (the “Oaktree Warrants”). The Oaktree Warrants expire on August 27, 2030 and may be net exercised at the holder’s election. Oaktree is entitled to additional warrants if at any time prior to the expiration of the Oaktree Warrants the Company issues equity, warrants or convertible notes (collectively known as “Security Instruments”) at a price that is less than 95% of the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the trading day prior to the issuance of the Security Instruments. As a result of the September 2024 registered direct offering (see Note 13), the Company issued an additional 14,450 warrants to Oaktree and adjusted the exercise price of the Oaktree Warrants to $7.2392, and recorded the resulting expense of $27,000 to interest expense. \n\n​\n\nThe Company filed registration statement No. 333-282384 on Form S-1 to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants and the additional Oaktree Warrants, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 7, 2024. \n\n​\n\n _Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”)_\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved the LTIP for the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Rosenwald, and Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, Mr. Weiss (amended and restated with stockholder approval on June 7, 2017 and May 23, 2024). The LTIP consists of a program to grant equity interests in the Company and in the Company’s subsidiaries, and a performance-based bonus program that is designed to result in performance-based compensation that is deductible without limit under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and 2023, the Compensation Committee granted 216,465 shares and 81,286 shares each to Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss, respectively. These equity grants were made in accordance with the LTIP, and each award represents 1% of total outstanding shares of the Company as of the dates of such grants. The shares’ original vesting terms includes vesting in full if the employee was either in the service of the Company as an employee, Board member or consultant (or any combination of the foregoing) on the tenth anniversary of the LTIP, or the eligible employee has an involuntary Separation from Service (as defined in the LTIP). The only other vesting condition – one based on the achievement of an increase in the Company’s market capitalization – has already been achieved, with respect to each annual award under the LTIP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n _University of Tennessee Research Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc._\n\nCaelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress that was sold to AstraZeneca’s Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary (“Alexion”) in October 2021, was the defendant in a lawsuit brought by The University of Tennessee Research Foundation (“UTRF”) captioned as _University of Tennessee Research Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc._ , No. 19-cv-00508, which was formerly pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the “UTRF Litigation”). UTRF brought claims against Caelum, for, _inter alia_ , trade secret misappropriation. UTRF primarily alleged that Caelum unauthorizedly used non-patent trade secrets owned by UTRF in the development of Caelum’s 11-1F4 monoclonal antibody, known as CAEL-101. Under the agreement pursuant to which Alexion acquired Caelum (as amended, the “DOSPA”), Fortress had certain indemnification obligations of Caelum pertaining to the UTRF litigation and maintained a consent right over any potential settlements of the UTRF litigation by Caelum.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a stipulation with the court pursuant to which UTRF’s claims were dismissed without prejudice; on October 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a definitive settlement agreement (the “UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which UTRF’s claims were dismissed with prejudice and Caelum agreed to make an upfront payment and additional potential milestone-based payments to UTRF. Fortress and the other sellers under the DOSPA are explicit releasees and third party beneficiaries under the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement. In connection with the execution of the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement, Caelum, Alexion and Fortress entered into an amendment to the DOSPA (the “DOSPA Amendment”), which, _inter alia_ : (1) terminated any continuing indemnification by Fortress and the other sellers under the DOSPA in respect of the UTRF Litigation; (2) reduced the amounts of the potential future earn-out payments potentially owing to the sellers under the DOSPA (including Fortress) from an aggregate amount up to $350 million to an aggregate amount up to $295 million; (3) released to Caelum all amounts remaining in an escrow fund that had been established at the time of the Alexion acquisition to backstop potential indemnifiable damages, including those incurring under the UTRF Litigation (with 100% of such released amount constituting reimbursement for legal fees and other expenses incurred by Caelum in defending the UTRF Litigation); and (4) memorialized Fortress’ consent for Caelum to settle the UTRF Litigation. Neither the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement nor the DOSPA Amendment implicates any out-of-pocket payment by Fortress or any other seller under the DOSPA.

At December 31, 2023, one of the Company’s dermatology products customers accounted for more than 10% of its total accounts receivable balance at 13%.\n\n​\n\n18. Income taxes\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to US federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return with subsidiaries for which the Company has an 80% or greater ownership interest. Subsidiaries for which the Company does not have an 80% or more ownership are not included in the Company’s consolidated income tax group and file their own separate income tax return. As a result, certain corporate entities included in these financial statements are not able to combine or offset their taxable income or losses with other entities’ tax attributes.\n\nIncome tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate, and includes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company expects a net deferred tax asset with a full valuation allowance and 0% estimated annual effective tax rate for 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and a refund of approximately $24,000, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n**19. Subsequent Events**\n\n _Journey_\n\n​\n\nOn November 4, 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates initial supply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025. \n\n​\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.\n\n​\n\nThe approval of Emrosi by the FDA triggered Journey’s requirement to draw on the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility with SWK. The FDA approval also triggered a $15.0 million milestone payment obligation to DRL that is due 30 days after the FDA approval.\n\n_Checkpoint_\n\nOn November 12, 2024, Checkpoint received approximately $9.2 million from the exercise of existing Series B warrants for the issuance of 3,256,269 shares of common stock from a May 2023 registered direct offering with an exercise price of $2.821 per share. \n\n​\n\n _Mustang Warrant Inducement and Private Placement_\n\nIn October 2024, Mustang entered into a definitive agreement for the exercise of certain existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of its common stock having an exercise price of $0.237 per share, originally issued in May 2024. The issuance or resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the existing warrants are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by Mustang on Form S-1 (File No. 333-278006). The gross proceeds to Mustang from the exercise of the existing warrants are expected to be approximately $4 million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by Mustang.\n\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the existing warrants for cash, Mustang issued two new series of unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 33,755,276 shares of common stock. The new warrants will have an exercise price of $0.27 per share and will be exercisable commencing on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the new warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). One of the new warrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of five years from the Stockholder Approval, and the other new series of warrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of twelve months from the Stockholder Approval.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2.** **Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n _You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total net revenue includes a one-time $19.0 million payment from Maruho for a license to additional territories in Asia. Journey, our partner company, primarily focuses on selling and marketing of prescription dermatology products.   \n---|---  \n●| For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $14.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, of net revenue is related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $42.5 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of net revenue is related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nLate Stage Product Candidates\n\nCosibelimab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) \n\n●| Cosibelimab’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of December 28, 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| In September 2024, our partner company, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab, its investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC, during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.  \n---|---  \n●| In July 2024, Checkpoint, announced the FDA had accepted for review its resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab,. The resubmission has been accepted as a complete response to the complete response letter received in December 2023, and the FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.  \n---|---  \n●| Cosibelimab was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Checkpoint.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nEmrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg, also known as DFD-29, for the treatment of rosacea) \n\n●| In November 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates initial supply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.  \n---|---  \n●| The approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.  \n---|---  \n●| In October 2024, data assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics “(PK”) of oral DFD-29 (versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. DFD-29 40mg showed higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, which may translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea.  \n---|---  \n●| In March 2024, the FDA accepted the NDA for DFD-29 and set a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024.   \n---|---  \n●| Emrosi (DFD-29) was developed for the treatment of rosacea at our partner company, Journey, in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  \n---|---  \n  \n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nTriplex (cytomegalovirus vaccine)\n\n●| Triplex, a vaccine for control of cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial for adults co-infected with HIV and CMV that is now fully enrolled with topline data anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The study aims to show that vaccination with Triplex can safely elicit a CMV-specific immune response and reduce asymptomatic CMV replication in a population of people with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. The study will also evaluate whether this intervention might reduce chronic inflammation and immune activation, as compared to placebo, and thus, potentially reduce related mortality and morbidity.   \n---|---  \n●| In May 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The trial is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIH/NIAID”) that could provide over $20 million in non-dilutive funding and will be conducted in up to 20 nationally recognized transplant centers in the United States.  \n---|---  \n●| Triplex is currently the subject of multiple ongoing clinical trials, including: a Phase 2 evaluation for CMV control in recipients of liver transplant (NCT06075745); a Phase 1/2 trial for CMV control in pediatric recipients of HCT (NCT03354728); a Phase 2 trial for safety and immunogenicity in adults living with HIV and CMV (NCT05099965); a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of stem cell transplant in which the stem cell donor is vaccinated with Triplex (NCT06059391) and a Phase 1 trial of Triplex in combination with a bi-specific CMV/CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT05432635).  \n---|---  \n●| In 2023, Helocyte additionally entered into an option agreement with City of Hope for exclusive worldwide rights to a novel bispecific CMV/HIV CAR T cell therapy (optionally for use in combination with Triplex), which is currently the subject of a Phase 1 trial in adults living with HIV-1 (see NCT06252402).  \n---|---  \n●| Triplex was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our subsidiary, Helocyte.  \n---|---  \n  \nCAEL-101 (Light chain fibril-reactive monoclonal antibody for AL Amyloidosis) \n\n●| On October 5, 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of which approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders totaling up to $295 million, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive 42.4% of all potential milestone payments, which together with the upfront payment, would total up to approximately $182 million.   \n---|---  \n●| There are two ongoing global Phase 3 studies of CAEL-101 for Mayo Stage IIIa and May Stage IIIb AL amyloidosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04512235 and NCT04504825).  \n---|---  \n●| CAEL-101 (anselamimab) was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Caelum (founded by Fortress) until its acquisition by AstraZeneca in October 2021.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nCUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) \n\n●| In December 2023, our subsidiary, Cyprium, completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl is obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CUTX-101, including the funding of the same. Additionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones under the Agreement and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 ranging from 3% to 12.5% on tiered annual net sales. Cyprium will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at the New Drug Application (“NDA”) approval for CUTX-101.  \n---|---  \n●| The rolling NDA for CUTX-101 was completed by Sentynl in the fourth quarter of 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| CUTX-101 was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Cyprium until the asset transfer in December 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nEarly Stage Product Candidates\n\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T-cell therapy)\n\n●| In March 2024, we announced our expansion into autoimmune diseases with MB-106, a personalized CD20-targeted, 3rd-generation autologous CAR T-cell therapy. Planning for a proof-of concept Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating MB-106 in autoimmune diseases is underway.   \n---|---  \n●| In June 2024, we announced updated data for MB-106 showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”), a rare form of blood cancer. There was an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 90% in the cohort with durable responses observed, including three complete responses (“CR”), two very good partial responses (“VGPR”), and four partial responses, and one patient remains in complete remission at 31 months.  \n---|---  \n●| MB-106 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nDotinurad (urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout) \n\n●| In July 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement, and related agreements (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation founded in 2023 and seeded by leading life sciences institutional investors. Urica transferred rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, dotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity including certain anti-dilution provisions through the raise of $150 million in equity securities. The Transaction Documents also granted Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, and receive nominal cash reimbursement payments for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad.  \n---|---  \n●| Dotinurad was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral therapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad was efficacious and well-tolerated in more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58 weeks in Phase 3 clinical trials.   \n---|---  \n●| Dotinurad was sourced by Fortress and was in development at Urica until dotinurad was acquired by Crystalys in July 2024.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nMB-109 (IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T Cells (MB-101) + HSV-1 oncolytic virus (MB-108)) \n\n●| In November 2024, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma.  \n---|---  \n●| In March 2024, data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating MB-101 IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T-cells in high-grade glioma were published in _Nature Medicine._ MB-101 was well tolerated and 50% of patients achieved stable disease or better, with two partial responses and two complete responses in high grade glioma patients. The two patients who achieved complete response both had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T-cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors), and their responses lasted 7.5 and 66+ months, respectively. In the cohort with dual intratumoral (ICT) / intraventricular (ICV) delivery and an optimized manufacturing process there was a ~70% improvement in median overall survival (10.2 months) compared to the expected survival rate of six months in this patient population.   \n---|---  \n●| MB-101, MB-108, and MB-109 are currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nAJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer)\n\n●| In May 2024, we announced that last patient completed dosing in a Phase 1b/2a study, which is evaluating AJ201 in the U.S. for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy’s Disease. Kennedy’s Disease is a debilitating rare genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting men. Topline data for the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 in SBMA are expected around year-end 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| AJ201 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Avenue.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nGeneral Corporate\n\n●| In July 2024, Checkpoint raised gross proceeds of $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at the-the-market under Nasdaq rules.   \n---|---  \n●| In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should be lifted.  \n---|---  \n●| Also in July 2024, Journey Medical entered into an amendment of its existing credit facility with SWK, increasing the amount of the facility from $20 million to $25 million.  \n---|---  \n●| Additionally in July 2024, Fortress announced the reduction of total debt outstanding and the entry into a new $50 million term loan with Oaktree Capital Management with a maturity in 2027. The Company borrowed $35.0 million under the agreement on the closing date and is eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million at the lenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. In connection with the new term loan, Fortress repaid the prior $50 million term loan with Oaktree.   \n---|---  \n●| In September 2024, Fortress raised gross proceeds of $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements.   \n---|---  \n●| In October 2024, Mustang raised $4 million in a warrant exercise and concurrent private placement.  \n---|---  \n●| In November 2024, Checkpoint raised $9.2 million in a warrant exercise.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies from December 31, 2023.\n\n**Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\n​\n\n**Smaller Reporting Company Status**\n\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we chose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K, have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and certain other matters.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as calculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s ownership of the issued and outstanding common and preferred shares in certain consolidated Fortress subsidiaries as of the period presented: \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n**Partner Company/Subsidiary**|  ​| **2024**  \nAvenue1| ​|  4.2| %  \nCellvation| ​|  79.2| %  \nCheckpoint1| ​|  9.7| %  \nCyprium| ​|  75.0| %  \nHelocyte| ​|  83.0| %  \nJourney1| ​|  47.6| %  \nMustang1| ​|  7.4| %  \nOncogenuity| ​|  73.5| %  \nUrica| ​|  68.4| %  \n  \n​\n\n​  \n---  \n  \nNote 1: Denotes entities that are publicly-traded.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \n**Revenue**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nProduct revenue, net| ​| $|  14,629| ​| $|  15,279| ​| $|  (650)| (4)| %  \nCollaboration revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  182| ​| ​|  (182)| (100)| %  \nRevenue – related party| ​|  —| ​|  31| ​|  (31)| (100)| %  \nOther revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  19,260| ​| ​|  (19,260)| (100)| %  \nNet revenue| ​|  14,629| ​|  34,752| ​|  (20,123)| (58)| %  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \n**Operating expenses**|  ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​|  ​| ​  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​|  5,285| ​|  6,429| ​|  (1,144)| (18)| %  \nResearch and development| ​|  9,446| ​|  20,288| ​|  (10,842)| (53)| %  \nResearch and development – licenses acquired| ​|  —| ​|  60| ​|  (60)| (100)| %  \nSelling, general and administrative| ​|  21,993| ​|  21,733| ​|  260| 1| %  \nTotal operating expenses| ​|  36,724| ​|  48,510| ​|  (11,786)| (24)| %  \nLoss from operations| ​|  (22,095)| ​|  (13,758)| ​|  (8,337)| 61| %  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nOther income (expense)| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​|  ​| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  589| ​|  547| ​|  42| 8| %  \nInterest expense and financing fee| ​|  (6,209)| ​|  (2,534)| ​|  (3,675)| 145| %  \nGain on common stock warrant liabilities| ​|  19| ​|  4,542| ​|  (4,523)| (100)| %  \nOther income | ​| ​|  1,071| ​|  620| ​|  451| 73| %  \nTotal other income (expense)| ​|  (4,530)| ​|  3,175| ​|  (7,705)| (243)| %  \nLoss before income tax expense| ​| ​|  (26,625)| ​|  (10,583)| ​|  (16,042)| 152| %  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nIncome tax expense | ​|  69| ​|  141| ​|  (72)| (51)| %  \n**Net Loss**|  ​| **(26,694)**|  ​| **(10,724)**|  ​| **(15,970)**| **149**| **%**  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling interest| ​|  13,827| ​|  5,679| ​|  8,148| 143| %  \n**Net loss attributable to Fortress**|  ​| **$**| **(12,867)**|  ​| **$**| **(5,045)**|  ​| **$**| **(7,822)**| **155**| **%**  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n49\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRevenue\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \n**Revenue**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nProduct revenue, net| ​| $|  14,629| ​| $|  15,279| ​| $|  (650)| ​| (4)| %  \nCollaboration revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  182| ​| ​|  (182)| (100)| %  \nRevenue – related party| ​|  —| ​|  31| ​|  (31)| ​| (100)| %  \nOther revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  19,260| ​| ​|  (19,260)| ​| (100)| %  \n**Net revenue**|  ​| **$**| **14,629**|  ​| **$**| **34,752**|  ​| **$**| **(20,123)**|  ​| **(58)**| **%**  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 we generated $14.6 million of net revenue related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $34.8 million of net revenue, of which $15.3 million relates to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products, $0.2 million relates to Cyprium’s collaboration revenue with Sentynl, and other revenue of approximately $19.3 million, which includes Journey’s receipt of royalties from its exclusive out-licensing partner for Qbrexza in Japan, Maruho, as well as a $19 million non-refundable upfront payment from Maruho related to a license granted by Journey to Maruho for the development and commercialization of Qbrexza in additional territories in Asia. Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from Maruho. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the net decrease in revenue of $20.1 million, or 58%, is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million up-front payment received in the third quarter of 2023 related to Qbrexza territory licensing. Journey’s $0.7 million, or 4%, decrease in product revenue is due primarily to a $0.6 million decrease in net product revenue from legacy products. Qbrexza net product revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, to $7.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $5.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, with the increase primarily driven by additional volume, due to Journey’s continued marketing efforts and the recent expansion of access and coverage platforms related to Qbrexza. This revenue increase was offset by a decrease in Accutane revenue of $0.9 million, or 18%, and a combined decrease in Amzeeq and Zilxi of $0.9 million, or 30%. Accutane’s decrease is attributed to recent market competition, and Amzeeq and Zilxi revenue is down due to a slight decrease in unit sales volume and an increase in coupon rebates as a result of the expansion of Journey’s patient coverage options under its overall market access program driving average selling prices lower as compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nCollaboration revenue related to Cyprium’s agreement with Sentynl was fully recognized as of December 31, 2023 due to Sentynl’s assumption of control of the CUTX-101 development program in December 2023.\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​| $|  5,285| ​| $|  6,429| ​| $|  (1,144)| ​| (18)| %  \n  \n​\n\nWe incurred $5.3 million and $6.4 million of costs of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The decrease in Other of $2.3 million is due to a decrease in clinical costs at Urica of $1.8 million related to the Phase 1b trial and the sale of the asset to Crystalys, and a decrease in research and development costs of $1.0 million at Cyprium due to the asset transfer of CUTX-101 to Sentynl in 2023, offset by an increase of $0.4 million in license costs at both Helocyte and Cellvation. Journey’s decrease of $1.4 million is primarily driven by lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. Avenue’s increase in research and development expense of $1.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in clinical development costs related to AJ201. Checkpoint’s increased research and development expense of $0.9 million is due to increased commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $1.1 million due to manufacturing costs incurred to build inventory to support a potential product launch, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates. \n\n​\n\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development expense for the periods presented:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - research & development| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  444| ​| $|  401| ​| $|  43| ​| 11| %  \nSubsidiaries/Partner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  89| ​|  144| ​|  (55)| ​| (38)| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  543| ​|  303| ​|  240| ​| 79| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  150| ​| ​|  24| ​| ​|  126| ​| 525| %  \nMustang| ​|  (10)| ​|  (18)| ​|  8| ​| (44)| %  \nOther1| ​|  —| ​|  1| ​|  (1)| ​| (100)| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development| ​|  1,216| ​|  855| ​|  361| ​| 42| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $64.6 million of net revenue, of which $44.4 million relates to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products, and $0.5 million relates to Cyprium’s collaboration revenue with Sentynl, $0.5 relates to Journey’s royalties from Maruho and $19 million is the non-refundable upfront payment from Maruho related to a license granted by Journey to Maruho for the development and commercialization of Qbrexza in additional territories in Asia. Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from Maruho. \n\nThe net decrease in revenue of $22.0 million or 34% is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million payment received from Maruho related to territory licensing for Qbrexza in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue from Journey’s legacy products decreased by $1.9 million, or 41%, to $2.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $4.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the continued price erosion of Targadox from generic competition.\n\n​\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​| $|  18,642| ​| $|  20,645| ​| $|  (2,003)| ​| (10)| %  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nCosts of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.6 million and $20.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold of $2.0 million, or 10%, is mainly due to product royalties that were lower by $1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to the contractual expiration of Journey’s Exelderm product royalty in November 2023, the contractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty in the second quarter of 2023, and the discontinuation of Ximino in September of 2023. In addition, the discontinuation of Ximino has resulted in lower PDUFA fees of $0.8 million and lower non-cash license amortization of $0.5 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in product costs of $0.5 million, as a result of product mix, mainly driven by the higher Accutane net product revenue.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n​\n\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents, laboratory costs and other supplies.\n\n​\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were approximately $47.1 million and $87.7 million, respectively.

Checkpoint’s reduced research and development expense of $15.9 million is due to reduced commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $9.5 million related to manufacturing costs incurred in the prior period to build inventory to support a potential product launch of cosibelimab, reduced regulatory expenses of $3.5 million as prior period costs included $3.2 million for the PDUFA fee for the BLA filing of cosibelimab in the first quarter of 2023, and a $2.1 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates. Journey’s increased research and development costs of $3.6 million are due to the $4.1 million filing fee payment made to the FDA in January 2024 for the DFD-29 NDA submission in addition to the $3.0 million contractual milestone payment made to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. triggered by the FDA’s acceptance of the DFD-29 NDA in March 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses incurred by Journey as the clinical program was concluded. \n\n​\n\nNoncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - research & development| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  1,319| ​| $|  1,200| ​| $|  119| 10| %  \nPartner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  179| ​|  150| ​|  29| 19| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  1,629| ​|  880| ​|  748| 85| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  466| ​| ​|  88| ​| ​|  377| ​| 426| %  \nMustang| ​|  (650)| ​|  —| ​|  (650)| 100| %  \nOther1| ​|  —| ​|  1| ​|  (1)| (100)| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development| ​| $|  2,943| ​|  2,319| ​| $|  624| 27| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\nWe expect research and development costs to remain lower in 2024 due to portfolio optimization and assets completing pivotal trials in 2023 and entering registration and approval stages.\n\n​\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n​\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were $60.9 million and $71.5 million, respectively.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs at Mustang is attributable to continued cost reduction efforts and optimization relating to personnel, consulting, and infrastructure. The decrease in Other is led by reduced professional fees and legal spending at Urica and Cyprium. The increase of $1.3 million at Checkpoint is attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.6 million due to new employee grants, and an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million.\n\n​\n\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense for the periods presented.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - Selling, general and administrative | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  6,280| ​| $|  6,787| ​| $|  (507)| ​| (7)| %  \nPartner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  535| ​|  449| ​|  86| ​| 19| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  1,862| ​|  1,345| ​|  517| ​| 38| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  4,254| ​| ​|  1,989| ​| ​|  2,265| ​| 114| %  \nMustang| ​|  150| ​|  380| ​|  (230)| ​| (61)| %  \nOther1| ​|  407| ​|  56| ​|  350| ​| 621| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - selling, general and administrative| ​| $|  13,488| ​|  11,006| ​| $|  2,482| ​| 23| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly lower for 2024.\n\n​\n\nAsset Impairment\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred impairment charges of $2.6 million attributable to Mustang’s assessment of the recoverability of the asset group consisting of its leasehold improvements and the associated right-of-use asset. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Journey recorded a loss on the impairment of intangible assets of $3.1 million related to the impairment of the Ximino intangible asset, due to lower net product revenue and gross profit levels for the Ximino products.\n\nOther Expense\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nOther expense| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nInterest income| ​| $|  2,157| ​| $|  2,296| ​| $|  (139)| ​| (6)| %  \nInterest expense and financing fee| ​|  (10,933)| ​|  (13,255)| ​|  2,322| ​| (18)| %  \nGain (loss) on common stock warrant liabilities| ​|  (578)| ​|  10,708| ​|  (11,286)| ​| (105)| %  \nOther income (expense)| ​| ​|  1,334| ​|  (2,049)| ​|  3,383| ​| (165)| %  \nTotal other expense| ​| $|  (8,020)| ​|  (2,300)| ​| $|  (5,720)| ​| 249| %  \n  \n​\n\nTotal other expense increased $5.7 million, or 249%, from expense of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to expense of $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of $11.3 million in the gain on common stock warrant liabilities, offset by the $2.3 million decrease in interest expense and financing fees due to debt paid off by JMC and Mustang in 2023, as well as the $3.4 million increase in other income due in part to Journey’s $1.1 million gain on the extinguishment of short-term debt related to installment payments for the license of Ximino. Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of a $4.1 million loss on the deconsolidation of Aevitas, offset by Mustang’s gain on the sale of assets to uBriGene of $1.4 million, and grant income of $0.7 million.\n\n56\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe will require additional financing to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for our existing and new product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for our potential products, and sales and marketing capabilities. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.9 million, of which $25.6 million relates to Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress, $4.7 million relates to Checkpoint, $3.5 million relates to Mustang, $22.5 million relates to Journey, and $2.6 million relates to Avenue. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. We may seek funds through equity or debt financings, joint venture or similar development collaborations, the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, royalty financings, or through other sources of financing; the rising interest rate environment may cause the Company to pay more interest on its various debt instruments, which could lead to higher operating expenses. \n\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\n​\n\nComponents of cash flows from publicly-traded partner companies comprise:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n($ in thousands)| **Fortress** 1| **Avenue**| **Checkpoint**| **JMC**| **Mustang**| **Total**  \nStatement of cash flows data:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (14,333)| ​| $|  (8,262)| ​| $|  (23,924)| ​| $|  (11,352)| ​| $|  (9,413)| ​| $|  (67,284)  \nInvesting activities| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nFinancing activities| ​|  (643)| ​|  9,076| ​|  23,699| ​|  6,374| ​|  6,329| ​|  44,835  \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (14,976)| ​| $|  814| ​| $|  (225)| ​| $|  (4,978)| ​| $|  (3,084)| ​| $|  (22,449)  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n($ in thousands)| **Fortress** 1| **Avenue**| **Checkpoint**| **JMC**| **Mustang**| **Total**  \nStatement of cash flows data:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (24,943)| ​| $|  (7,127)| ​| $|  (40,757)| ​| $|  21,760| ​| $|  (42,223)| ​| $|  (93,290)  \nInvesting activities| ​|  44| ​|  (3,000)| ​|  —| ​|  (5,000)| ​|  5,916| ​|  (2,040)  \nFinancing activities| ​|  9,131| ​|  3,580| ​|  30,461| ​|  (24,014)| ​|  (30,037)| ​|  (10,879)  \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (15,768)| ​| $|  (6,547)| ​| $|  (10,296)| ​| $|  (7,254)| ​| $|  (66,344)| ​| $|  (106,209)  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1:| Includes Fortress, non-public subsidiaries and elimination entries.  \n---|---  \n  \nCash flows on a consolidated basis are as follows:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (67,284)| ​| $|  (93,290)| ​| $|  26,006  \nInvesting activities| ​|  —| ​|  (2,040)| ​|  2,040  \nFinancing activities| ​|  44,835| ​|  (10,879)| ​|  55,714  \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (22,449)| ​| $|  (106,209)| ​| $|  83,760  \n  \n​\n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $26.0 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the decrease of $30.6 million in net loss, the $11.1 million decrease in the expense associated with subsidiaries/partner companies’ warrant liabilities, and the $8.0 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by the $3.1 million change in the expense for research and development – licenses acquired, $4.1 million change in the expense for loss from deconsolidation and dissolution of subsidiaries, and $3.1 million for Journey’s asset impairment loss in the prior period.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is a decrease of $2.0 million, due to JMC’s $5.0 million used in investing activities for the deferred cash payment made to VYNE related to the acquisition of Amzeeq and Zilxi and Avenue’s $3.0 million cash payment towards the purchase of the AnnJi license, each in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by Mustang’s $6.0 million proceeds from the sale of assets to uBriGene in July 2023, and no comparable activities in the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $44.8 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $55.7 million. The increase is attributable to the funds used in the prior period to pay off partner companies’ long-term debt of $50.4 million and JMC’s line of credit of $30.9 million, offset by loan proceeds of $38.7 million, proceeds from partner companies’ sale of stock, options and warrants of $37.1 million in the current period.\n\nWe fund our operations through cash on hand, the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, and from the proceeds resulting from the exercise of warrants and stock options. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.9 million, of which $25.6 million relates to Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress, $4.7 million relates to Checkpoint, $3.5 million relates to Mustang, $22.5 million relates to Journey, and $2.6 million relates to Avenue. Restricted cash at September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, of which $1.2 million relates to Fortress, $0.4 million relates to Mustang, and $0.5 million relates to Cyprium.\n\nSources of Liquidity \n\n_Stock Offerings and At-The-Market Share Issuances_\n\n _Fortress_\n\nOn May 17, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-279516) on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 30, 2024 (the “2024 Shelf”).

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Avenue issued 245,617 shares through the Avenue ATM for net proceeds of $0.9 million.\n\n​\n\n _Mustang_\n\n​\n\nOn April 23, 2021, Mustang filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-255476) (the “Mustang 2021 S-3”), which was declared effective on May 24, 2021. Under the Mustang 2021 S-3, Mustang was able to sell up to a total of $200.0 million of its securities. In 2024, Mustang sold approximately $4.4 million of securities under the Mustang 2021 S-3 until Mustang’s ability to register new offers and sales of securities under such registration statement expired on May 24, 2024. \n\nOn May 31, 2024, Mustang filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279891) (the “Mustang 2024 S-3”), which was declared effective on June 12, 2024. Under the Mustang 2024 S-3, Mustang may sell up to a total of $40.0 million of its securities. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $36.3 million of the Mustang 2024 S-3 remains available for sales of securities, subject to the General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3. The ability of Mustang to register new offers and sales of securities under the Mustang 2024 S-3 expires on June 12, 2027. \n\n​\n\nOn May 31, 2024, Mustang entered into an At-the-Market Offering Agreement (the “Mustang ATM”) relating to the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Mustang 2024 S-3. Under the Mustang ATM, Mustang pays the sales agents for the program a commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mustang issued approximately 2.7 million shares through the Mustang ATM for net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.\n\n​\n\n60\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn May 2024, Mustang closed on an equity offering of 1,160,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 15,717,638 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof), and three series of 50,632,914 warrants with a combined equity offering price of $0.237 per share (or per share common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants with an exercise price of $0.237 per share. The Series A-1 warrants have a five-year term, the Series A-2 warrants have a twenty-four month term, and the Series A-3 warrants have a nine month term. The warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including share splits, share dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The net proceeds of the equity offering, after deducting the fees and expenses of the placement agent and other offering expenses payable by Mustang, but excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants, was approximately $3.2 million. All of the 15,717,638 pre-funded warrants have since been exercised.\n\n​\n\nIn June 2024, Mustang closed on a registered direct offering of 3,025,000 shares of common stock at $0.41 per share (or common stock equivalent) priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,105,000 shares of common stock, at a price per pre-funded warrant equal to $0.4099, the price per share of common stock, less $0.001. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, became exercisable upon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full. In a concurrent private placement, Mustang also agreed to issue and sell unregistered warrants to purchase up to 6,130,000 shares of its common stock, with an exercise price of $0.41 per share, exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants and will expire five years from the date of stockholder approval. Net proceeds were approximately $2.1 million, after placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million. All of the 3,105,000 pre-funded warrants have since been exercised.\n\n_Journey_\n\nOn December 30, 2022, Journey filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269079) (the “Journey 2022 S-3”), which was declared effective on January 26, 2023.

The development and regulatory approval processes can take many years, and it is unlikely that our product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA and/or foreign equivalent regulatory bodies, would be commercially available for several years. Only a small percentage of drugs under development successfully obtain regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot be sure that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment.\n\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. Before we may seek regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will be required to demonstrate, through well-controlled clinical trials, that our product candidates are effective and have a favorable benefit-risk profile for their target indications. Success in early clinical trials is not necessarily indicative of success in later stage clinical trials, during which product candidates may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, despite having progressed through initial clinical testing, which may cause significant setbacks. Further, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical trials may never receive regulatory approval.\n\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may place limitations on our ability to commercialize products at the intended price points, may grant approval contingent on the product’s performance in costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings, contraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization of the product. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), or foreign equivalent, may schedule one or more of our product candidates under the Controlled Substances Act, or its foreign equivalent, which could impede such product’s commercial viability. Any of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\n\nThe extensive regulation to which our product candidates are subject may be costly and time consuming, cause anticipated or unanticipated delays, and/or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for commercialization. \n\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product candidate until the FDA approves such product candidate’s BLA or NDA. The approval process is uncertain, expensive, often spans many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition to significant and expansive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on the results of required non-clinical testing, including the characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. \n\nThe FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes, testing procedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Further, the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process and may change approval policies or interpretations of regulations at any time, which could delay, limit or preclude a product candidate’s approval. \n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or refuse approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\n●| disagreement with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use of clinical trial methods and methods of data analysis;  \n---|---  \n●| an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and/or effective for an indication;  \n---|---  \n●| the FDA’s rejection of clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;  \n---|---  \n  \n63\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| the FDA’s determination that clinical trial results do not meet the statistical significance levels required for approval;   \n---|---  \n●| a disagreement by the applicable regulator regarding the interpretation of preclinical study or trial data;   \n---|---  \n●| determination by the FDA that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical supplies or plan to contract for commercial supplies, do not satisfactorily comply with cGMPs; or  \n---|---  \n●| a change to the FDA’s approval policies or interpretation of regulations rendering our clinical data, product characteristics, or benefit-risk profile insufficient or unfavorable for approval.  \n---|---  \n  \nForeign approval procedures vary by country and may, in addition to the aforementioned risks, involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\n\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials, or suspensions or terminations of such trials, could result in increased costs and/or delay our ability to pursue regulatory approvals.\n\nThe commencement or resumption of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:\n\n●| obtaining regulatory approval to commence or resume a clinical trial;  \n---|---  \n●| identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;  \n---|---  \n●| reaching and maintaining agreements on acceptable terms with CROs and trial sites, the terms of which may be subject to extensive negotiation and modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;  \n---|---  \n●| obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;  \n---|---  \n●| developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;  \n---|---  \n●| adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;  \n---|---  \n●| the death, disability, departure or other change to the principal investigator or other staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;  \n---|---  \n●| identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or  \n---|---  \n●| retaining patients who participate in a clinical trial and replacing those who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.  \n---|---  \n  \nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the termination of a given development program or the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\n\nIf any of our product candidates causes unacceptable adverse safety events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product, preventing us from generating revenue from such products’ sale. Alternatively, even if a product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could lead to the withdrawal of such product from the market.\n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and/or delay or prevent our ability to complete development of that product candidate or generate product revenues.\n\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;  \n---|---  \n●| inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;  \n---|---  \n●| stopping rules contained in the protocol;  \n---|---  \n●| unforeseen safety or chemistry, manufacturing and control issues, or other determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and  \n---|---  \n●| lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.  \n---|---  \n  \nRegulatory requirements and guidance may change, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any such change may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs, which may in turn impact a clinical trial’s cost, timing, and likelihood of success. If any clinical trial is delayed, suspended, or terminated, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer. In addition, many of these factors may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\n\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidates will be reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. Any of these developments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\n\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial opportunity for one or more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-licensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\n●| capital resources;  \n---|---  \n●| development resources, including personnel and technology;  \n---|---  \n●| clinical trial experience;  \n---|---  \n●| regulatory experience;  \n---|---  \n●| expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and  \n---|---  \n●| manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property or exclusivity rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and/or less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\n\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\n\nIf any of the technologies underpinning our product candidates, including gene therapy, is claimed to be unsafe, such product candidate may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The success of our gene therapy platforms in particular depends upon physicians who specialize in treating the diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments involving our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Concern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the commercialization of our products.\n\nThe making, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances are subject to regulation by state, federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies. \n\nControlled substances are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) and regulations of the DEA. IV tramadol, under development by our partner company Avenue, will be subject to these regulations.\n\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse and no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. \n\nVarious states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\n\nFor any of our products classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. There is a risk that DEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product candidates and the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to both meet commercial demand and build inventory to mitigate possible supply disruptions.\n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRegulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our product candidates that are classified as controlled substances, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. \n\nThe FDA limits regulatory approval for our product candidates to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\n\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases set forth in the approval for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWhile physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s label or that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities (“off label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine or behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies regarding the promotion of off-label use. \n\nIf our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions, including Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall, institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\n\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a product candidate satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for the product candidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\n\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain more additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would likely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization in a timely manner, or at all.\n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\n\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. \n\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\n\nWe have historically financed a significant portion of our growth and operations in part through the assumption of debt. Should an event of default occur under any applicable loan documents, our business would be materially adversely affected. Further, our current credit arrangement with Oaktree restricts our and certain of our subsidiaries’ and partner companies’ abilities to take certain actions.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the total amount of debt outstanding, net of the debt discount, was $52.5 million. If we default on our obligations, the holders of our debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest, and/or take possession of any pledged collateral. If an event of default occurs, we may be unable to cure it within the applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment and we may be unable to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, current or future debt obligations may limit our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs, or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Such restrictions may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, we entered into a $60 million senior secured credit agreement (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the “Oaktree Note”) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, “Oaktree”). On July 25, 2024, we, as borrower, entered into a $50.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the “New Oaktree Agreement”) with Oaktree. We borrowed $35.0 million under the Agreement on the date of the agreement and are eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million with the lenders’ consent. The New Oaktree Agreement replaces the Prior Oaktree Agreement. The New Oaktree Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that we maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement, and (ii) that product net sales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month basis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain exclusions. Failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test. The breach of any other such provisions (even, potentially, in an immaterial manner) could result in an event of default under the New Oaktree Agreement, the announcement and impact of which could have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. The restrictions imposed by such provisions may also inhibit our and certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies’ ability to enter into certain transactions or arrangements that management otherwise believes would be in our or such partner companies’ best interests, such as dispositions that would result in cash inflows to Fortress and/or our subsidiaries and partner companies, or acquisitions or financings that would promote future growth.\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe have a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will be able to sustain current revenues or whether we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\n\nWe continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $86.5 million and $122.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $142.3 million and $203.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future, and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity.\n\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n\n●| one or more of our development-stage product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we decide to commercialize such product(s) ourselves, due to the need to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;  \n---|---  \n●| we are required by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;  \n---|---  \n●| there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;  \n---|---  \n●| we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, depending on the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;  \n---|---  \n●| there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;  \n---|---  \n●| we become involved in any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits; and  \n---|---  \n●| there are any regulatory developments affecting our competitors’ product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our development stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such development-stage products. Our ability to generate revenue from such development-stage products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\n●| obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire in the future;  \n---|---  \n●| manufacture commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; and  \n---|---  \n●| develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved.  \n---|---  \n  \nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nTo fund our operations and service our debt securities, which may be deemed to include our Series A Preferred Stock, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock to decline.\n\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by Journey and its ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Journey may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries and partner companies, including Journey, is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and partner companies.\n\nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the capital markets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our competitive position and results of operations.\n\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts or planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth strategy.\n\n​\n\nOur R&D programs will require substantial additional capital for research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, establishing pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establishing and developing quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing, and future collaborations, and through additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress the trading prices of our Securities. If additional funds are required to support our operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\n\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $46.9 million and $92.0 million, respectively, and during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $101.7 million and $134.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs. \n\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our public float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the “baby shelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to use the highest closing sales price of our common stock (or the average of the last bid and last ask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days of sales under the registration statement to calculate our public float.\n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAs of the date of the 2023 Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K, and until we again have a public float with a value in exceeds of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our public float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statements will also decrease.\n\nOur ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner or on different terms than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. The terms of our existing debt arrangements, including that with Oaktree, have and will continue to inhibit our and our subsidiaries’ abilities to raise capital.\n\nWe may be unable to generate returns for our investors if our partner companies and subsidiaries, several of which have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products or, if not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party financing.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial financial and operational commitments in our subsidiaries, which often have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund product and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on the ability of one or more of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies to innovate, in-license, develop or acquire successful biopharmaceutical products and/or acquire companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing to commercialize products or are not acquired in change-of-control transactions that result in cash distributions, as applicable, the value of our businesses and our ownership stakes in our partner companies may be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\n\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing Common Stock (or other Securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock), the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have also entered into financing arrangements to raise capital for our subsidiaries under which Common Stock is or may be issuable to investors in lieu of cash, upon certain conditions being met; in the event such issuances take place, they will also be dilutive of the stakes of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings may impose covenants that restrict our operations, including by limiting our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain financial commitments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\n\n​\n\nWe have paused dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and may not be able to resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the future if we have insufficient cash or available “surplus” as defined under Delaware law to make such dividend payments.\n\nOn July 5, 2024, our board of directors paused the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock until further notice. However, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock accrue daily, are payable monthly and will continue to accrue from the last date of payment. Our board of directors deemed the foregoing to be in the best interests of the Company and its common stockholders in light of the Company’s current and anticipated financial condition and outlook, and after considering its fiduciary duties to the Company’s common stockholders and other relevant factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the future requires us to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital, and that we have sufficient working capital in order to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business. Our ability to pay dividends may also be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash or “surplus” to resume payment of the cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in a timely manner, or at all. \n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future, except for the dividend we previously paid on our Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders.\n\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we previously paid on shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses, and retain our stock positions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash or stock dividends. Equally, each of our subsidiaries and partner companies is governed by its own board of directors with individual governance and decision-making regimes and mandates to oversee such entities in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we alone cannot determine the acts that could maximize value to you of such partner companies and subsidiaries in which we maintain ownership positions, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for holders of our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock and other securities to fund our operations, and our future ability to obtain additional capital through stock sales or other securities offerings may be more costly than in the past, or may not be available to us at all.\n\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock to fund our operations. For example, we raised an aggregate of approximately $30.2 million in gross proceeds in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and $6.5 million in gross proceeds in fiscal 2024 to date through the sale of shares of our common stock and other securities in offerings made under a Form S-3 “shelf” registration statement. Using a shelf registration statement to conduct an equity offering to raise capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. We are no longer eligible to file any new shelf registration statements due to non-payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock since July 5, 2024 and, if we do not resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, pay all accumulated dividends and otherwise remain compliant with the other conditions for use of a Form S-3 registration statement by the time we file our next Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will lose the ability to use our currently effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3. Accordingly, we may then only be able to conduct additional offerings of our securities under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement. We would expect either of these alternatives to be a more expensive method of raising additional capital and more dilutive to our stockholders relative to using a shelf registration statement.\n\n​\n\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation \n\nFuture revenue based on sales of our dermatology products, Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Targadox, Exelderm and Luxamend, may be lower than expected or lower than in previous periods.\n\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products through our partner company Journey. Any setback that may occur with respect to such products could significantly impair our financial condition, cash flows and/or operating results and/or reduce the value of our Securities. Setbacks for such products could include, but are not limited to, issues related to: supply chain, shipping; distribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product quality; marketing; government regulation, including but not limited to pricing or reimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with existing or new products, including third-party generic competition; product acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical professionals, and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls. Also, a significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition; the introduction of new competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. \n\n​\n\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity. \n\n​\n\nJourney’s products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result.\n\n​\n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nA significant portion of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating income. Three of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi, and Emrosi, for which we recently received FDA approval, currently have patent protection. Four of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. \n\n​\n\nAccutane currently competes in the Isotretinoin market with five other therapeutically equivalent A/B rated products. Targadox currently competes with one therapeutically equivalent A/B rated generic product. Exelderm may face A/B rated generic competition in the future.\n\n​\n\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version by third-party payors, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Any reduction in sales of our products, or the prices we receive for our products as a result of generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\n​\n\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of Journey’s field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on our existing revenue stream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop and for which we receive marketing authorization, will depend on our ability to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any such products. \n\n​\n\nJourney’s field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions to our relationship with such field sales force or the professional employer organization that employs our field sales force, could materially adversely affect our product sales. \n\n​\n\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the establishment of a contract field sales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any such product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\n​\n\nIf our products are not included in managed care organizations’ formularies or coverage by other organizations, our products’ utilization and market shares may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nIn the United States, continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment of our currently marketed products or those which we may acquire or develop in the future.\n\n​\n\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies are based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our products. If our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\n73\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nReimbursement for our products and product candidates may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\n\nWe have obtained approval for some products, and intend to seek approval for other product candidates, to commercialize in both the United States and in countries and territories outside the United States. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign countries, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those countries relating to such products. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures.\n\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which pharmaceuticals they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination regarding whether a product is:\n\n●| a covered benefit under its health plan;  \n---|---  \n●| safe, effective and medically necessary;  \n---|---  \n●| appropriate for the specific patient;  \n---|---  \n●| cost-effective; and  \n---|---  \n●| experimental or investigational.  \n---|---  \n  \nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require that we provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Additionally, while we may seek approval of our product candidates in combination with each other, there can be no guarantee that we will obtain coverage and reimbursement for any of our products together, or that such reimbursement will incentivize the use of our products in combination with each other as opposed to in combination with other agents which may be priced more favorably to the medical community.\n\n​\n\nLegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare systems of the United States and certain foreign countries could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Several federal agencies including FDA, CMS, DEA and HHS, in addition to state and local governments, regulate drug product development and marketing. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products by revising the payment methodology for many products reimbursed by Medicare, resulting in lower rates of reimbursement for many types of drugs, and added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program that involves commercial plans negotiating drug prices for their members. In addition, this law provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this law and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Therefore, any limitations in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in reductions in payments from private payors.\n\nSince 2003, there have been several other legislative and regulatory changes to the coverage and reimbursement landscape for pharmaceuticals. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” was enacted and made significant changes to the United States’ healthcare system. The ACA and any revisions or replacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn the United States there is significant interest in containing healthcare costs and increasing the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. Congress has continually explored legislation intended to address the cost of prescription drugs. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.\n\nWhile we cannot predict what additional proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly change the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates.\n\nState legislatures are similarly active in proposing and passing legislation and regulations aimed at controlling pharmaceutical and biological prices and drug cost transparency. \n\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and prescription drugs may adversely affect:\n\n●| the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;  \n---|---  \n●| the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and  \n---|---  \n●| the availability of capital.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payment that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\n\n​\n\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidate, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\n\n​\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n\nWe have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. We have also entered into several arrangements under which we have agreed to contingent dispositions of subsidiaries, partner companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\n\n​\n\nWe have entered into and consummated several partnerships and/or contingent sales of our assets and subsidiaries, including an equity investment and contingent acquisition agreement between Caelum and AstraZeneca (the acquisition component of which has consummated) and a development funding and contingent asset purchase between Cyprium and Sentynl (the acquisition component of which has not yet consummated). Each of these arrangements has been time-consuming and has diverted management’s attention. As a result of these consummated/contingent sales, as with other similar transactions that we may complete, we may experience a reduction in the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets, our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. \n\nIn addition, in connection with any transaction involving a (contingent or non-contingent) sale of one of our subsidiaries, partner companies or their assets, we may surrender our ability to realize long-term value from such asset or company, in the form of foregone product sales, royalties, milestone payments, sublicensing revenue or otherwise, in exchange for upfront and/or other payments. In the event, for instance, that a product candidate underpinning any such asset or company is granted FDA approval for commercialization following the execution of documentation governing the sale by us of such asset or company, the transferee of such asset or company may realize tremendous value from commercializing such product, which we would have realized for ourselves had we not executed such sale transaction and been able to achieve applicable approvals independently.\n\nShould we seek to enter into collaborations or divestitures with respect to other assets or companies, we may be unable to consummate such arrangements on satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms within our anticipated timelines. In addition, our ability to identify, enter into and/or consummate collaborations and/or divestitures may be limited by competition we face from other companies in pursuing similar transactions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. \n\n​\n\nAny collaboration or divestiture we pursue, whether we are able to complete it or not, may be complex, time consuming and expensive, may divert from management’s attention, may have a negative impact on our customer relationships, cause us to incur costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted collaboration or divestiture during the transaction process and also to incur costs of closing and disposing the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities. In addition, if such transactions are not completed for any reason, the market price of our Common Stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of our Securities. \n\n​\n\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of the obligations, actions or inactions of certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies. We have also entered into, and may again enter into, certain arrangements with our subsidiaries, partner companies and/or third parties pursuant to which a substantial number of shares of our capital stock may be issued. Depending on the terms of such arrangements, we may be contractually obligated to pay substantial amounts to third parties, or issue a substantially dilutive number of shares of our capital stock, based on the actions or inactions of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies, regulatory agencies or other third parties.\n\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as indemnitor of potential losses or liabilities that may be experienced by one or more of our subsidiaries, partner companies and/or their partners or investors. If we become obligated to pay all or a portion of such indemnification amounts, our business and the market value of our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or debt securities may be materially adversely affected. \n\nAdditionally, we have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to act as guarantor in connection with equity or debt raises by our partner companies, pursuant to which we may become obligated either to pay what could be a significant amount of cash or issue what could be a significant number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock if certain events occur or do not occur, which could lead to a depletion of resources or dilution to our Common Stock, or both. \n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and product candidates, and if we are unable to do so, or to integrate acquired products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\n\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| exposure to unknown liabilities;  \n---|---  \n●| disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;  \n---|---  \n●| difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the current economic environment;  \n---|---  \n●| incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;  \n---|---  \n●| higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;  \n---|---  \n●| increased amortization expenses;  \n---|---  \n●| difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;  \n---|---  \n●| impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and  \n---|---  \n●| inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger biopharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us and/or may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles at our partner companies, subsidiaries, related parties and/or other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, which could result in conflicts of interests relating to ongoing and future relationships and transactions with these parties.\n\nWe share directors and/or officers with certain of our subsidiaries, partner companies, related parties and other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in the future, including with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and procedures to identify and mitigate such conflicts, and that any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such policies or procedures were negotiated at arm’s length in conformity with fiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflict of interest, may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such potential or perceived conflicts could expose us to lost profits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\n\nCertain of our executives, directors and principal stockholders, whose interests may be adverse to those of our other stockholders, can control our direction and policies.\n\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and stockholders own nearly or more than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock and, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own a significant percentage of our capital stock. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our \n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nassets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock by:\n\n●| delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;  \n---|---  \n●| impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or  \n---|---  \n●| discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we acquire, enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in, companies in the future, our financial condition, operating results and the value of our Securities may be adversely affected, thereby diluting stockholder value, disrupting our business and/or diminishing the value of our holdings in our partner companies.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain significant ownership stakes in other companies. Acquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;  \n---|---  \n●| diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;  \n---|---  \n●| successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;  \n---|---  \n●| the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;  \n---|---  \n●| the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;  \n---|---  \n●| with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and  \n---|---  \n●| potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other transaction opportunities, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, we might incur higher costs than anticipated, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\n\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our business activities.\n\nAny terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including military conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy. This includes Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and the Hamas and Hezbollah extremist groups, recent attacks by armed groups on cargo ships in the Red Sea, and tensions across the Taiwan Strait. For instance, the United States or other countries may impose sanctions that restrict doing business in the effected countries and increased military conflict may affect third-party vendors and cause delays.\n\nThis risk may be magnified in the case of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s invasion and the ensuing response by Ukraine may disrupt our partner companies’ ability to conduct clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, and potentially other neighboring countries. Although the impact of Russia’s military action is highly unpredictable, certain clinical trial sites may be affected, including those of our partner company Checkpoint in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia. Those clinical trial sites may suspend or terminate trials, and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to relocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation in clinical trials. For instance, Checkpoint had to terminate their Phase 3 NSCLC trial in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of such conflicts. Alternative sites to fully and timely compensate for clinical trial activities in these areas may not be available, and we may need to find other countries to conduct these clinical trials. Clinical trial interruptions may delay our plans for clinical development and approvals for our product candidates, which could increase costs and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. \n\n78\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\n\nWe rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on such third parties and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates and products, if approved. Further, we rely solely on third parties to manufacture Journey’s commercialized products. Such dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our businesses. \n\nWe depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to applicable specifications and FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies and authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMPs or comparable regulations, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable compliance, and commercial product could be unfit for sale, or if distributed, could be recalled from the market. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, or distribution of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, pass any regulatory agency inspection or otherwise perform under our agreements with them could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, several of our currently commercialized products, sold through our partner company Journey, are produced by a single manufacturer, and, although we closely monitor inventory prophylactically, disruptions to such supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to meet product demand and therefore diminish revenues. Finally, in light of partner company Mustang’s recent reduction in force in April 2024, we may increase our reliance at Mustang on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of one or more product candidates for which our collaborators or we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms, and even if we are able to establish such agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance entails additional risks.\n\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the raw materials and equipment necessary to produce product candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those products. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials since such agreements are entered into by our third-party manufacturers and their qualified suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of raw material components related to an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\n\n​\n\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to engage in our own commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if they received marketing approval, and would likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials, as well as our planned dependence on third party manufacturers for any products that may be approved, may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition to the manufacturing and supply functions they provide, third-party manufacturers also play a key role in our efforts to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, by interacting with, providing important information to, and hosting inspections by, applicable regulatory authorities. If a given contract development and manufacturing organization upon whom we rely in such a capacity is unwilling or unable to perform these activities on our behalf, the successful development and/or approval of the applicable product candidate could be delayed significantly.\n\nIn addition, because of the sometimes-limited number of third parties who specialize in the development, manufacture and/or supply of our clinical and preclinical materials, we are often compelled to accept contractual terms that we deem less than desirable, including without limitation as pertains representations and warranties, supply disruptions/failures, covenants and liability/indemnification. Especially as pertains liability and indemnification provisions, because of the frequent disparities in negotiating leverage, we are often compelled to agree to low caps on counterparty liability and/or indemnification language that could result in outsized liability to us in situations where we have zero or relatively little culpability. \n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of products and product candidates.\n\nTo date, we have engaged primarily in intellectual property acquisitions, and evaluative and R&D activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales (except through Journey). We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $694.9 million. We may need to rely on third parties for activities critical to the product candidate development process, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| identifying and evaluating product candidates;  \n---|---  \n●| negotiating, drafting and entering into licensing and other arrangements with product development partners; and  \n---|---  \n●| continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe have also not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our development-stage product candidates, should any of them be approved for marketing. If we were to have any such product candidates approved, the successful commercialization of such products would be dependent on us performing or contracting with third parties for performance, of a variety of critical functions, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| advising and participating in regulatory approval processes;  \n---|---  \n●| formulating and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and  \n---|---  \n●| conducting sales and marketing activities.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of, product candidates, both at the Fortress level and via our subsidiaries and partner companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to develop and commercialize potential product candidates, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities.\n\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed-upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\n\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations and site management organizations to conduct most of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, site management organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. These CROs, investigators, and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines or fails to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash and/or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, or the FDA’s willingness to accept such data, may be jeopardized.\n\n80\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities or potential liability. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with GLPs as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our clinical research organizations fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept such data, or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP in strict conformity to cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. \n\nWe also are required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\n\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional contract research organizations or site management organizations involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research organization or site management organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract research organizations or site management organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.\n\nWe rely on clinical and pre-clinical data and results obtained from and by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\n\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we generally intend on developing product candidates with previously-validated mechanisms of action and seek to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical and pre-clinical data and other results produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, not acceptable by regulatory authorities or not applicable to our product candidates or acquired products, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our current or future product candidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\n\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and/or incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\n\nWe anticipate substantial reliance on strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our existing product candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\n\nIf we enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will, in part, depend on the performance of research collaborators. We may not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.\n\n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaboration proposals based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property positions. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues that might follow are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products. \n\nSuch collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on, and such collaborations could be more attractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\n\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n\n●| significant time and effort from our management team;  \n---|---  \n●| coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and  \n---|---  \n●| effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe contractual provisions we may be forced to agree upon in services, manufacturing, supply and other agreements may be inordinately one-sided, vis-à-vis current or historical standard market terms (especially as pertains contractual liability and indemnification paradigms), and as a result we may be subject to liabilities that are not attributable to our own actions or the actions of our personnel. \n\n​\n\nThere is a finite number of service providers who can perform the services or produce the materials or product candidates that we need, and we therefore often have a limited number of options in choosing such service providers. The standard market terms in many of the agreements into which we customarily enter with such service providers are subject to evolution over time, often-times in favor of our counterparties. Also, some such agreements are “adhesion contracts” under which our contractual counterparties refuse to entertain any modifications to their template documentation. One area where service providers often have and exert leverage over us is the negotiation of liability language – specifically in broadly scoped indemnification by us of service providers and/or the application of liability damages “caps” to certain of such service providers’ indemnification obligations. In any circumstance where we’ve been compelled to agree to such language, it is conceivable that we will be liable to third parties for liabilities in excess of such caps that are attributable to the actions, forbearances and/or culpability of such service providers and their indemnitees (and not to those of us and our personnel).\n\n​\n\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining patents or what the scope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\n●| patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive product candidates and their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;  \n---|---  \n●| our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners do, and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our abilities to make, use, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent applications that we may have;  \n---|---  \n●| there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and  \n---|---  \n  \n82\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, _inter partes_ review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. \n\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of issued patents.\n\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and their trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’ proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\n\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or more product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary information and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the US. The patent situation outside the US is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the US, and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than US law does. We might also become involved in derivation proceedings in the event that a third party misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more inventions. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party derived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. \n\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of the US have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection. \n\nSuch subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the US. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\n\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include changes to transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first inventor-to-file” system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a less burdensome, quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. The PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first inventor-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\n\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect our business.\n\n84\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we or our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the US. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or any of our licensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party’s intellectual property rights, we may have to, among other things:\n\n●| obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;  \n---|---  \n●| abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial funds, time and resources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;  \n---|---  \n●| pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;  \n---|---  \n●| pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or  \n---|---  \n●| defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\n\nCompetitors may infringe our or our licensors’ patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging invalidity of our or our licensors’ patents or that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the PTO to institute _inter partes_ review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor’s is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors’ patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could likewise put pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\n\n85\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe in-license from third parties a majority of the intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize products and product candidates. As such, any dispute with the licensors or non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\n\nThe patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights underpinning the vast majority of our existing product candidates were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of such license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product, and our ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\n\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our partners, on the one hand, and the respective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\n\nThe types of disputes that may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;  \n---|---  \n●| the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the licensors’ right title and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the rights and obligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense under such license agreement;  \n---|---  \n●| the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what activities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;  \n---|---  \n●| whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;  \n---|---  \n●| the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the subject of such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the calculation of royalty, milestone, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the extent to which rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;  \n---|---  \n●| disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent expenses;  \n---|---  \n●| intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to licensed intellectual property) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and  \n---|---  \n●| the priority of invention of patented technology.  \n---|---  \n  \n86\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\n\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval but do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates, if approved, generate from sales will be limited.\n\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, by third-party payors, including government payors, generally would also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| the timing of market introduction of such products as well as competitive products;  \n---|---  \n●| the clinical indications for which the product is approved;  \n---|---  \n●| acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;  \n---|---  \n●| the potential and perceived advantages of such products over alternative treatments;  \n---|---  \n●| the safety of such products in a broader patient group (i.e., based on actual use);  \n---|---  \n●| the availability, cost and benefits of treatment, in relation to alternative treatments;  \n---|---  \n●| the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for such products;  \n---|---  \n●| the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;  \n---|---  \n●| relative convenience and ease of administration;  \n---|---  \n●| the prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;  \n---|---  \n●| the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and  \n---|---  \n●| unfavorable publicity relating to the product.  \n---|---  \n  \n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\n\n​\n\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.\n\nWe may not be able to obtain the desired labeling claims or scheduling classifications necessary or desirable for the promotion of our marketed products (or our product candidates if approved). We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval while our products are on the market, the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority in another jurisdiction may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be impacted or withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.\n\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one or more of our product candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and may have to limit their commercialization, if approved.\n\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate or product we develop, license, or acquire allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate or product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\n●| withdrawal of clinical trial participants;  \n---|---  \n●| suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;  \n---|---  \n●| decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop, license or acquire;  \n---|---  \n●| initiation of investigations by regulators;  \n---|---  \n●| impairment of our business reputation;  \n---|---  \n●| costs of related litigation;  \n---|---  \n●| substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;  \n---|---  \n●| loss of revenues;  \n---|---  \n●| reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and  \n---|---  \n●| the ability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. When needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\n\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\n\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them are approved.\n\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the authorized manufacturing facilities, processes and equipment, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing drug or biological products, as well as review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company presentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. \n\nWe also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of drug products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\n●| restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;  \n---|---  \n●| restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;  \n---|---  \n●| requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| warning letters, untitled letters, or Form 483s;  \n---|---  \n●| recalls or other withdrawal of the products from the market;  \n---|---  \n●| refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;  \n---|---  \n●| fines;  \n---|---  \n●| suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;  \n---|---  \n●| refusal to permit the import or export of products;  \n---|---  \n●| product seizure or detentions;  \n---|---  \n●| injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and  \n---|---  \n●| adverse publicity.  \n---|---  \n  \n89\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may be subject to the actions listed above, including losing marketing approval for product candidates when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\n\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until the relevant governmental authority has completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory review process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates in the U.S. will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the PTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we could lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\n\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;  \n---|---  \n●| federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;  \n---|---  \n●| HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;  \n---|---  \n  \n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to “covered recipients,” which include physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals) and applicable manufacturers. Applicable group purchasing organizations also are required to report annually to CMS the ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act added to the definition of covered recipient practitioners including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives effective in 2022; and  \n---|---  \n●| analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  \n---|---  \n  \nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our businesses.\n\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which could adversely affect our financial results, including without limitation the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding minority or non-control investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\n\nRecent U.S. Supreme Court decisions could create uncertainty in the life sciences space that could negatively impact our business.\n\nThree decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2024 may lead to an increase in litigation against regulatory agencies that could create uncertainty and thus negatively impact our business. The first decision overturned established precedent that required courts to defer to regulatory agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. The second decision overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings. The third decision extended the statute of limitations within which entities may challenge agency actions. These cases may result in increased litigation by industry against regulatory agencies and impact how such agencies choose to pursue enforcement and compliance actions. However, the specific, lasting effects of these decisions, which may vary within different judicial districts and circuits, is unknown. We also cannot predict the extent to which FDA and SEC regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and changes.\n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nGeneral and Other Risks\n\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.\n\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary business information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality, availability and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\n\n​\n\nWe are in the process of implementing our internal security and business continuity measures and developing our information technology infrastructure. Our internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, third-party software, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware and other malicious code, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\n\n​\n\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, our partner company Journey was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that affected its accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The details of the incident and its origin were investigated with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts working at the direction of legal counsel. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not appear to have compromised any personally identifiable information or protected health information. The federal government has been able to seize a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets associated with the breach. Once the cryptocurrency has been converted back into U.S. dollars, Journey expects to receive a notification letter to initiate the return of the cash. This process could take as long as six months or more to complete. Fortress and Journey may incur additional expenses and losses as a result of this cybersecurity incident, including those related to investigation fees and remediation costs. \n\n​\n\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\n\n​\n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal information, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary business information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more effectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. We may face increased costs and find it necessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach.\n\n​\n\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\n\n​\n\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.\n\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific, and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we continue to implement growth strategies and acquire and invest in companies with varied businesses. During our operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy, the demands on our key employees will expand, and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel, or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions, could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our partners. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, and are not the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may occur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability to continue operations.\n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal sanctions.\n\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other clients.\n\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or the employees or consultants that are implicated.\n\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\n\nThe stock prices of our securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, acquisition of potential new product candidates and companies and/or in-licensing through multiple partners/affiliates;  \n---|---  \n●| sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n●| issuance of debt or other securities;  \n---|---  \n●| our delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;  \n---|---  \n●| announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;  \n---|---  \n  \n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| developments concerning our licensors and/or product manufacturers;  \n---|---  \n●| litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;  \n---|---  \n●| conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;  \n---|---  \n●| governmental regulation and legislation;  \n---|---  \n●| unstable regional political and economic conditions;  \n---|---  \n●| variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and  \n---|---  \n●| change in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations.  \n---|---  \n  \nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\nSales or other issuances of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\n\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an effective registration statement. In addition, pursuant to our current shelf registration statements on Form S-3, from time to time we may issue and sell shares of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or our Series A Preferred Stock could cause a drop in the trading price of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\n\nWe will need to continue to expend capital on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or products could place a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train, and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our business.\n\nA catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or cause us to lose key data, which could cause us to curtail or cease operations.\n\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health epidemics and pandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our businesses could be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects. \n\nAny of the aforementioned circumstances, may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to provide services in-person and/or in a timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger effectiveness of “force majeure” clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve developmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the enforceability of developmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\n\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage- point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use all of its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\n\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n\nWe, and/or third parties on our behalf, may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\n\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n\n​\n\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business or the business of our partners.\n\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\n\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nIf the timing of FDA’s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be delayed, which could result in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. Also, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our Securities.\n\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\n\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of SOX. These efforts to comply with Section 404 and related regulations have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our control systems in the future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\n\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock or other Securities.\n\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers and/or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\n●| the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and  \n---|---  \n●| the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\n\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your ownership of our Securities through an acquisition.\n\n97\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange.\n\nWe have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of the Nasdaq, including rules requiring that the minimum trading price of our Common Stock not close below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If we again are unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\n\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. For example, the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\n\n​\n\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the rate of return that we realize on the investment securities that we hold.\n\n​\n\nWe customarily invest a significant portion of our cash in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) accounts, which bear interest income to us that fluctuates according to adjustments in the target federal funds rate effected by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”). The FOMC recently lowered the target federal funds rate and is anticipated by some to effect further decreases over the coming weeks and months, actions which have decreased, and could further decrease, the amount of interest income that we generate on our CDARS and on other short-term cash equivalent investment securities that we may hold.\n\n​\n\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds \n\nNone.\n\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\n\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should be lifted.\n\n​\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total undeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\nItem 4.

Exhibits 99\nSIGNATURES 101\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. The risks described below are a summary of the\nprincipal risks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, the risk factors\ndescribed in Item 1A, and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As used below and\nthroughout this filing (including in the risk factors described in Item 1A), the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress Biotech, Inc. individually,\nto one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development\n● Many of our product candidates are in early development stages and are subject to time and cost intensive regulation and clinical testing, which\nmay result in the identification of safety or efficacy concerns. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully developed or\ncommercialized.\n● Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’ commercial opportunity\nand profitability.\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\n● We have a history of operating losses and expect such losses to continue in the future.\n● We have funded our operations in part through the assumption of debt, and the applicable lending agreements may restrict our operations. Further,\nthe occurrence of any default event under an applicable loan document could adversely affect our business.\n● Our research and development (“R&D”) programs will require additional capital, which we may be unable to raise as needed and which may\nimpede our R&D programs, commercialization efforts, or planned acquisitions.\n● Our board of directors has paused payments of dividends on our preferred stock, and there can be no assurance that monthly dividend payments\nwill be resumed in a timely manner, or at all.\n● If we raise additional capital by issuing equity, equity-linked securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities, our\nexisting stockholders will be diluted.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey”)\n● Our operating income derives primarily from the sale of our partner company Journey’s dermatology products, particularly Qbrexza, Accutane,\nAmzeeq and Zilxi. Any issues relating to the manufacture, sale, utilization, or reimbursement of Journey’s products (including products liability\nclaims) could significantly impact our operating results.\n● A significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party\ngeneric competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which\ncould have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. Three of Journey’s marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, as well as\nEmrosi, a modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea licensed from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, for which we recently obtained\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval, currently have patent protection. Four of Journey’s marketed products, Accutane,\nTargadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. With respect to Journey\nproducts that are covered by valid claims of issued patents, such patents may be subject to invalidation, which would harm our operating income.\n● Continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for\ncommercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors. Third-party\npayors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and\nefficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of current and newly approved therapeutics.\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n● We have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size\nand scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.\n3\nTable of Contents\n● We and our subsidiaries and partner companies have also entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, arrangements under which we and/or\nthey have agreed to contingent dispositions of such companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the\nvalue of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. The\nconsummation of any such arrangements with respect to certain product candidates may also result in our eligibility to receive a lower portion of\nsales (if any) of resulting approved products than if we had developed and commercialized such products ourselves.\n● Our growth and success depend on our acquiring or in-licensing products or product candidates and integrating such products into our businesses.\n● We act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of certain obligations of our subsidiaries, partner companies and\npartners, which could require us to pay substantial amounts based on the actions or omissions of said entities.\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\n● We rely heavily on third parties for several aspects of our operations, including manufacturing and developing product candidates, conducting\nclinical trials, and producing commercial product supply. Such reliance on third parties reduces our ability to control every aspect of the drug\ndevelopment process and may hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n● If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not\nsufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technologies and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize our technologies and products may be impaired.\n● We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or to\nenforce our or our licensors’ patents.\n● Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Pertaining to Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation\n● Generic drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products.\n● In connection with these applications, generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through\nlitigation and/or with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). Such challenges may subject us to costly and time-consuming\nlitigation and/or PTO proceedings.\n● As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or PTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic competitor of our\nproducts, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of product sales in a short period of\ntime, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\n● If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such products are likely to\nbe limited.\n● We may not obtain the desired product labels or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications desirable to\nsuccessfully promote our products.\n● Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical trials, the results\nof which could cause such products to later be withdrawn from the market.\n● Any successful products liability claim related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur substantial liability and\nlimit the commercialization of such products.\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n● We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or executive action may\nhave on our operations.\n4\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Other Risks\n● We have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), and if we again are unable to\nmeet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if\nwe are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market\nprice of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term\nvalue for shareholders through product revenue, equity holding and dividend and royalty revenue streams. Fortress works in concert with its extensive\nnetwork of key opinion leaders to identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for potential acquisition. The Company has executed\nsuch arrangements in partnership with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope\nNational Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital,\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, AstraZeneca plc and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress leverages its\nbusiness, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary companies then assess a broad\nrange of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and development, including joint ventures, partnerships,\nout-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four partner companies are publicly-traded, and three subsidiaries have\nconsummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including AstraZeneca plc as successor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”).\nOur subsidiaries and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and product candidates\nare: Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic”, a subsidiary of Avenue), Cellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”),\nCheckpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc. (“Helocyte”), Journey Medical\nCorporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO, “Mustang”) and Oncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”).\nAs used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner\ncompanies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context. Generally, “subsidiary” refers to a private Fortress subsidiary, “partner company” refers\nto a public Fortress subsidiary, and “partner” refers to an entity with whom one of the foregoing parties has a significant business relationship, such as an\nexclusive license or an ongoing product-related payment obligation. The context in which any such term is used throughout this document, however, may\ndictate a different construal from the foregoing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, the Company’s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sale of subsidiaries/partner\ncompanies, and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants. The Company has incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating\nactivities since inception and expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the next several years as it continues to fully develop and prepare regulatory\nfilings and obtain regulatory approvals for its existing and new product candidates. Current cash and cash equivalents of $25.6 million for Fortress and\nprivate subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress (“Parent Entity”) are considered sufficient to fund the Parent Entity’s operations for at least the next 12\nmonths. However, the Company will need to raise additional funding through strategic relationships, public or private equity or debt financings, sale of\npartner companies, grants or other arrangements to develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for the existing and new product\ncandidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for the potential products, sales and\nmarketing capabilities. If such funding is not available or not available on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company’s current development plans and\nplans for expansion of its general and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. Fortress also has the ability, subject to limitations imposed by Rule\n144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and other applicable laws and regulations, to raise money from the sale of common stock of the public companies in\nwhich it has ownership positions.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.\nAccordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,\nthe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for\nthe fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s\nannual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statement results\nare not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future period.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year for each of Avenue,\nCheckpoint, Mustang and Journey. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the\n“2023 Form 10-K”), from which the Company derived the balance sheet data at December 31, 2023, as well as Checkpoint’s Form 10-K, filed with the\nSEC on March 22, 2024, Mustang’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, Avenue’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, and\nJourney’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024.\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control\nbut does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary,\nbut retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents\nnon-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are\neliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as\ncalculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s significant\nestimates include, but are not limited to provisions for coupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, specialty pharmacy discounts, managed care rebates, product\nreturns, inventory realization, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock\noptions and warrants, stock-based compensation, common stock issued to acquire licenses, accrued expenses and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty\ninherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company records cash held in trust or pledged to secure certain debt obligations as restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of restricted cash representing pledges to secure debt obligations and letters of credit in\nconnection with certain office leases, and an undertaking posted by Cyprium to secure potential damages in an injunctive proceeding.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

The amendment in the ASU is intended to improve reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update are effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures in\nan entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n3. Asset Purchase Agreements\nMustang\nAgreements with uBriGene\nOn May 18, 2023, Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to which\nMustang agreed to sell its leasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Facility”), and associated assets relating\nto the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to uBriGene (the “Transaction”). Mustang and uBriGene subsequently\nentered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2023 (“Amendment No. 1”), and Amendment No. 2 to the\nOriginal Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 28, 2023 (“Amendment No. 2,” and together with the Original Asset Purchase Agreement and\nAmendment No. 1, the “Prior Asset Purchase Agreement”).\nOn July 28, 2023, pursuant to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang completed the sale of all of its assets that primarily relate to the manufacturing\nand production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (such operations, the “Transferred Operations” and such assets, the “Transferred Assets”) to\nuBriGene for upfront consideration of $6 million cash (the “Base Amount”). The Transferred Assets included all of Mustang’s assets, except for Mustang’s\nlease and related leasehold improvements of the Facility and contracts that are primarily used in the Transferred Operations. Mustang recorded a gain of\n$1.4 million in connection with the sale of the Transferred Assets and recorded approximately $0.3 million of the base consideration as deferred income,\nthat was to be recognized upon the transfer of the lease.\nIn connection with the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene submitted a voluntary joint notice to the U.S. Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the United States (“CFIUS”). Following CFIUS’s review and subsequent investigation of the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase\nAgreement, on May 13, 2024, Mustang, together with uBriGene and CFIUS, executed a National Security Agreement (the “NSA”), pursuant to which\nMustang and uBriGene agreed to abandon the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection\ntherewith. The NSA obligated uBriGene and Mustang to terminate agreements between the two parties, including the Manufacturing Services Agreement,\nQuality Services Agreement, and Subcontracting CDMO Agreement. In addition, uBriGene must sell, or otherwise dispose of, the equipment assets\npurchased within 180 days after the execution of the NSA.\nJune 2024 Repurchase of Assets\nOn June 27, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to\nwhich Mustang agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to repurchase the Transferred Assets, primarily lab equipment and supplies\n(collectively, the “Repurchased Assets”). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene also terminated existing\nmanufacturing and services agreements.\nAs consideration for the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang has agreed to pay to uBriGene a total purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1.4 million,\nconsisting of (i) an upfront payment of $0.1 million due within five (5) business days of the Effective Date and a (ii) subsequent amount of $1.3 million\ndue on the date that is twelve (12) months after the closing date (the “Deferred Amount”). In the event that as of the original (or any extended) date on\nwhich the Deferred Amount is payable, Mustang has, as of the date of the public reporting of its then-most recent quarterly audited or unaudited financial\nstatements, net assets below $20 million, then Mustang may, upon written notice to uBriGene, elect to delay its payment obligation of the Deferred Amount\nby an additional six (6) months, with no limit on the number of such extensions available to Mustang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mustang has not\npaid the Deferred Amount in full as of the date that is twelve (12) months after closing of the Repurchase Agreement, any amounts that remain outstanding\nwill accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum beginning on the date that is twelve (12) months after closing and until the Deferred Amount is paid in full.\nAdditionally, in connection with the termination of the agreements described above under the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang agreed to forgive a net\nreceivable from uBriGene of approximately $3.3 million, comprised of outstanding receivables of $6.9 million and payables of $3.6 million, resulting in\ntotal purchase consideration in the Repurchase Transactions of approximately $4.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, the $1.3 million Purchase Price was\nrecorded in Accrued Expenses - Other (see Note 10). As of September 30, 2024, the disposal group continues to be held for sale.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMustang allocated the total purchase consideration of $4.7 million to the Repurchased Assets on a relative fair value basis. Mustang used a third-party to\nperform a valuation of the repurchased equipment, which resulted in a fair value less costs to sell of approximately $2.2 million. The remaining purchase\nconsideration of $2.5 million was allocated to the supplies repurchased. The supplies repurchased with no alternative future use were recognized as\nresearch and development expense in an amount of $2.2 million. Repurchased supplies with an alternative future use of $0.3 million were also recognized\nin research and development expense, as Mustang does not have plans to resume operations in the facility, and it intends to dispose of the supplies in a\nsingle transaction with the equipment. Mustang concluded that the disposal group, which includes the repurchased equipment assets and associated\nsupplies with an aggregate value of approximately $2.2 million, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the date of acquisition.\nUrica\nOn July 15, 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”), royalty agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”), and related agreements\n(collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2022 and\nseeded by life sciences institutional investors. Under the Transaction Documents, Urica sold the rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in\ndevelopment for the treatment of gout, dotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to\nUrica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity. Urica’s equity position cannot be reduced below 15% of Crystalys’ fully-\ndiluted equity capitalization until it raises $150 million in equity securities.\nThe Transaction Documents also grant Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, as well as the\nright to receive $0.6 million cash reimbursement for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad. Urica has the right to\nappoint one director to the board of directors of Crystalys, as well as an additional board observer. Crystalys is obliged to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to develop and commercialize dotinurad.\nThe APA also gives Urica the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the sold assets for a repurchase price not to exceed $6.4 million plus accrued\ninterest; the repurchase option expires upon the consummation by Crystalys of a qualified financing of at least $120 million occurring within the earlier to\noccur of (i) twelve months after receipt by Crystalys of minutes from an anticipated FDA meeting; or (ii) July 15, 2026. Urica recorded a liability for the\n$0.6 million received, which will be accreted up to the repurchase price over the term of the repurchase option, and will not recognize an asset for its\nownership interest received in Crystalys until the expiration of the repurchase option. Accordingly, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Urica\nrecorded accretion of $0.3 million of the repurchase option price, booked to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nAvenue\nInvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“InvaGen”) Share Repurchase\nUnder the Share Repurchase Agreement between Avenue and InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“InvaGen”) under which Avenue repurchased all of\nInvaGen’s shares in Avenue, Avenue agreed to pay InvaGen an additional amount as a contingent fee, payable in the form of seven and a half percent\n(7.5%) of the net proceeds of future financings, until $4.0 million in the aggregate is paid to InvaGen. In connection with equity financings in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, Avenue made payments totaling $0.7 million to InvaGen.\n4.

Fortress’ depreciation expense is\nrecorded in both research and development expense and general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mustang concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain leasehold\nimprovements and the related right of use asset. Mustang assessed the carrying value of the asset group consisting of the leasehold improvements and\nright-of-use asset in accordance with ASC 360, given the significant changes to Mustang’s operations, operating cash and the repurchase of equipment. The\nassessment of the recoverability of the asset group concluded that there was impairment on the carrying value of the asset group of approximately $2.6\nmillion, which was allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of the assets. Approximately $2.2 million of the impairment loss was\nallocated to leasehold improvements, with the remaining $0.4 million allocated to the right-of-use asset.\n6.

The Company borrowed $35.0\nmillion under the New Oaktree Agreement on the Closing Date (the “2024 Oaktree Note”) and is eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million at the\nlenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. The 2024 Oaktree Note replaces the 2020 Oaktree Note (as defined below) in which\nthe remaining $50.0 million balance was repaid in full.\nUnder the terms of the New Oaktree Agreement, the loans have a 30-month interest-only period with a maturity date of July 25, 2027, and bear interest at\nan annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 7.625% (subject to a 2.50% SOFR floor and a 5.75% SOFR cap). For\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, the interest rate applicable to the 2024 Oaktree Note was 12.91%. The Company is required to make quarterly\ninterest-only payments until the maturity date, except fifty percent of the then-outstanding principal balance of the loans is due on March 31, 2027, with the\nremaining principal amount due on the maturity date.\nThe Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the amounts due under the New Oaktree Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment fee.\nSubject to prior written notice by the Company, to repay any amounts due prior to the maturity date, the Company must pay the sum of (A) the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (B) any accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (C) any applicable\nYield Protection Premium (as defined in the New Oaktree Agreement) and (D) if applicable, other unpaid amounts then due and owing pursuant to the New\nOaktree Agreement and the other loan documents (such aggregate amount, the “Prepayment Price”); provided that each partial prepayment of the principal\namount of the Loans shall be in an aggregate amount of at least $5.0 million and integral multiples of $1.0 million in excess thereof.

The lenders may elect to receive warrants to purchase\ncommon stock of the Company as an alternative to cash prepayments in some situations where a mandatory prepayment would otherwise be required. No\nmandatory prepayments were required in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among\nother things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other\ndistributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that\nthe Company maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (“the\n“Liquidity Requirement”), and (ii) that product net sales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month\nbasis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain\nexclusions. Due to the approval of Emrosi, the minimum net sales amount will increase by $7.5 million each quarter, beginning in the third quarter of 2025,\nprovided that the minimum net sales amount will in no event exceed $80.0 million. Both the Minimum Net Sales Test and the Liquidity Requirement will\nbe reduced to $0 while the outstanding principal balance is less than or equal to $10.0 million. The Liquidity Requirement decreases to $5.0 million while\nthe outstanding principal balance is between $10.0 million and $25.0 million. Failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in\nan event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test.\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains events of default that are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure\nperiods. In addition, the Company is also required to (i) raise common equity, or receive in monetizations or distributions, by the end of each calendar year\nprior to the maturity date, in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $20 million or 50% of an amount set forth in an annual budget delivered to the\nlenders and (ii) maintain a specified minimum equity stake in Journey. The capital raise and minimum stake covenants and financial covenants will not\napply if the outstanding principal balance of the loan is less than or equal to $10 million. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable,\nthe Agent will have the right upon notice to accelerate all amounts outstanding under the New Oaktree Agreement, in addition to other remedies available\nto the lenders as secured creditors of the Company.\nIn connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted a security interest in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the lenders, in\nsubstantially all of the Company’s assets, subject to customary exceptions, as collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the New Oaktree\nAgreement.\nAlso in connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted warrants to the lenders to purchase up to 506,390 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock at a purchase price of $2.0735 per share (the “Warrants”). The Warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price,\nincluding for share splits, share dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The exercise price of the Warrants will also be adjusted if, while the\nWarrants are outstanding, the Company engages in any transaction involving the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock or equivalent securities at an\neffective price per share less than the exercise price of the Warrant then in effect (such lower price, the “Base Share Price”). In such case, the exercise price\nof the Warrants will be reduced to equal the Base Share Price. The Warrants are exercisable from July 25, 2024 and will expire on July 25, 2031 and may\nbe net exercised for no cash payment at the holder’s election. The Company filed a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of Company\ncommon stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (see Note 13).\nThe Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the New Oaktree Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\n23\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n2020 Oaktree Note\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company’s $50.0 million outstanding balance of the senior secured credit agreement with Oaktree (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement”\nand the debt thereunder, the “2020 Oaktree Note”) was terminated upon receipt by Oaktree of a payoff amount of $51.4 million from the Company\ncomprised of principal, interest and the applicable final payment amount. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.6\nmillion, representing unamortized debt issuance costs and inclusive of a $1.0 million prepayment fee. The payoff of the 2020 Oaktree Note was treated as\na debt extinguishment, as the 2024 Oaktree Note originated from a fund group different from the Prior Oaktree Agreement.\nThe Company had entered the Prior Oaktree Agreement in August 2020. The Prior Oaktree Agreement contained customary representations and warranties\nand customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as certain financial covenants, including, among other things, (i) maintenance of minimum\nliquidity and (ii) a minimum revenue test that required Journey’s annual revenue to be equal to or to exceed annual revenue projections set forth in the\nPrior Oaktree Agreement. Failure by the Company or Journey, as applicable, to comply with the Prior Oaktree Agreement covenants would result in an\nevent of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company.\nThe Company was required to make quarterly interest-only payments until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2020 Oaktree Note, August 27,\n2025, at which point the outstanding principal amount would have been due. The Company could have voluntarily prepaid the 2020 Oaktree Note at any\ntime subject to a prepayment fee. The Company was required to make mandatory prepayments of the 2020 Oaktree Note under various circumstances as\ndefined in the Prior Oaktree Agreement.\nSWK Term Loan\nOn December 27, 2023 (the “SWK Closing Date”), Journey entered into a Credit Agreement with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”). The Credit Agreement\nprovides for a term loan facility (the “Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the SWK Closing Date, Journey drew\n$15 million. On June 26, 2024, Journey drew the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility. Loans under the Credit Facility (the “Term Loans”)\nmature on December 27, 2027. The Term Loans accrue interest which is payable quarterly in arrears. The Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum\nequal to the three-month term SOFR (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets quarterly. Interest payments began in February\n2024 and are paid quarterly.\nOn July 9, 2024, Journey entered into an amendment (the “SWK Amendment”) to the Credit Facility. The SWK Amendment increased the total amount\navailable under the Credit Facility from $20.0 million to $25.0 million. The $5.0 million available under the SWK Amendment is contractually required to\nbe drawn upon FDA approval of Journey’s DFD-29 product candidate, Emrosi, subject to Journey receiving such approval on or before June 30, 2025. The\nFDA approved Emrosi on November 4, 2024 (see Note 19).\nBeginning in February 2026, Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5% of\nthe principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date. If the total revenue of Journey, measured on a\ntrailing twelve-month basis, is greater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, the principal repayment start date is extended from February 2026 to\nFebruary 2027, at which point Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 15% of\nthe principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date.\nJourney may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in whole or in part. Prepayment of the Term Loans is subject to\npayment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2% of the Term Loans prepaid plus the amount of interest that would have been due through the first\nanniversary of the SWK Closing Date if the Term Loans are prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, (ii) 1% of the Term Loans\nprepaid if the Term Loans are prepaid on or after the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date but prior to the second anniversary of the SWK Closing\nDate, or (iii) 0% if prepaid thereafter.\n24\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nUpon repayment in full of the Term Loans, Journey will pay an exit fee equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. Additionally,\nJourney paid an origination fee of $0.2 million on the SWK Closing Date and incurred issuance costs of $0.2 million, both of which have been recorded as\na debt discount. Journey is accreting the carrying value of the SWK Term Loan to the original principal balance plus the exit fee over the term of the loan\nusing the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount is accounted for as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The\neffective interest rate on the SWK Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 was 14.9%.\nThe SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all\nassets of Journey. As of September 30, 2024, Journey was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK Credit Facility.\nUrica 8% Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Offering\nIn December 2022 and February 2023, Urica closed private offerings of its 8% Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Stock (the “Urica Preferred\nStock”), at a price of $25.00 per share (“Subscription Price”) pursuant to which it sold a total of 135,494 shares of Urica Preferred Stock for gross proceeds\nof $3.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million (the “Urica Offering”). A\nnon-cash contingent warrant value of $0.1 million was also recorded in debt discount (see Note 6).\nDividends on the Urica Preferred Stock were payable monthly by Fortress in shares of Fortress common stock based upon a 7.5% discount to the average\nclosing price over the 10-day period preceding the dividend payment date. Dividends were recorded as interest expense. For the three month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of nil and $0.1 million associated with the Urica dividends and for the nine month periods\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, associated with the Urica dividends.\nThe shares mandatorily converted into Urica common stock upon either: (i) a qualified financing pursuant to which Urica raises at least $20 million in\naggregate gross proceeds; or (ii) a sale of Urica. Additionally, in the event that neither such a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica had occurred prior to\nJune 27, 2024, then each holder of Urica Preferred Stock was eligible to receive, at Fortress’ election, one of: (x) a cash payment equal to the product of the\nSubscription Price and the number of shares of Urica Preferred Stock held by such holder; (y) a number of shares of Fortress common stock equal to the\nFortress Share Exchange Amount (as defined in the applicable instrument); or (z) a combination of the foregoing. On June 27, 2024, as neither a qualified\nfinancing nor a sale of Urica occurred, Fortress elected to exchange the outstanding shares of Urica Preferred Stock, which was recorded as a liability, into\n2,028,345 shares of Fortress common stock.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes contractual interest, and fees include amortization of the debt discount and amortization of fees associated with loan transaction\ncosts, amortized over the life of the loan.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n12. Net Loss per Common Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributed to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributed to Fortress, less the Series A\nPreferred dividends and adjusted for subsidiary deemed dividends, by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the\nperiod, not including unvested restricted stock, and without consideration for Common Stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as the\nbasic loss per share due to net losses in all periods.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0\nmillion and $6.0 million, respectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0 million and $6.0 million,\nrespectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted and basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the\nCompany were identical since potential common shares were excluded from the calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive. nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the following potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of net loss per common\nshare:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nWarrants to purchase Common Stock 14,499,535 127,296\nOptions to purchase Common Stock 558,896 160,233\nUnvested Restricted Stock 1,628,082 1,338,750\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units 166,160 106,708\nTotal 16,852,673 1,732,987\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\n9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Dividends\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the\nCompany’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). In accordance with the terms of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared.\nThe pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision\nregarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should\nbe lifted.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total\nundeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on\nSeptember 30, 2024. Dividends in arrears that have not been declared by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets but are reflected in the net loss attributable to common shareholders (see Note 12).\nStock-based Compensation\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had the following equity compensation plans: the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended\n(the “2013 Plan”), the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) and the Fortress Biotech, Inc.

UTRF\nprimarily alleged that Caelum unauthorizedly used non-patent trade secrets owned by UTRF in the development of Caelum’s 11-1F4 monoclonal antibody,\nknown as CAEL-101. Under the agreement pursuant to which Alexion acquired Caelum (as amended, the “DOSPA”), Fortress had certain indemnification\nobligations of Caelum pertaining to the UTRF litigation and maintained a consent right over any potential settlements of the UTRF litigation by Caelum.\nOn September 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a stipulation with the court pursuant to which UTRF’s claims were dismissed without prejudice;\non October 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a definitive settlement agreement (the “UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which\nUTRF’s claims were dismissed with prejudice and Caelum agreed to make an upfront payment and additional potential milestone-based payments to\nUTRF.

Neither the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement\nnor the DOSPA Amendment implicates any out-of-pocket payment by Fortress or any other seller under the DOSPA.

Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to US federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or\nrefundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax\ncredit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nincome in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is\nmore likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return with subsidiaries for which the Company has an 80% or greater ownership interest. Subsidiaries for\nwhich the Company does not have an 80% or more ownership are not included in the Company’s consolidated income tax group and file their own separate\nincome tax return. As a result, certain corporate entities included in these financial statements are not able to combine or offset their taxable income or\nlosses with other entities’ tax attributes.\nIncome tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate, and includes\ninterest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company expects a net deferred tax asset with a full valuation allowance and 0% estimated annual\neffective tax rate for 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and a refund of\napproximately $24,000, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and\n$0.1 million, respectively.\n19. Subsequent Events\nJourney\nOn November 4, 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40mg) for the\ntreatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates initial\nsupply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met\nall co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically\nsignificant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment\ntreatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.\nThe approval of Emrosi by the FDA triggered Journey’s requirement to draw on the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility with SWK. The FDA\napproval also triggered a $15.0 million milestone payment obligation to DRL that is due 30 days after the FDA approval.\nCheckpoint\nOn November 12, 2024, Checkpoint received approximately $9.2 million from the exercise of existing Series B warrants for the issuance of 3,256,269\nshares of common stock from a May 2023 registered direct offering with an exercise price of $2.821 per share.\nMustang Warrant Inducement and Private Placement\nIn October 2024, Mustang entered into a definitive agreement for the exercise of certain existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of\nits common stock having an exercise price of $0.237 per share, originally issued in May 2024. The issuance or resale of the shares of common stock\nissuable upon exercise of the existing warrants are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by Mustang on Form S-1 (File No. 333-\n278006). The gross proceeds to Mustang from the exercise of the existing warrants are expected to be approximately $4 million, prior to deducting\nplacement agent fees and offering expenses payable by Mustang.\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the existing warrants for cash, Mustang issued two new series of unregistered warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 33,755,276 shares of common stock. The new warrants will have an exercise price of $0.27 per share and will be exercisable commencing on\nthe effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the new warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). One of\nthe new warrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of five years from the Stockholder Approval, and the other new series of\nwarrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of twelve months from the Stockholder Approval.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $42.5 million and $44.4 million, respectively,\nof net revenue is related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products.\nLate Stage Product Candidates\nCosibelimab (anti-PD-L1 antibody)\n● Cosibelimab’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and has a\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of December 28, 2024.\n● In September 2024, our partner company, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab, its investigational anti-PD-\nL1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) who are not candidates\nfor curative surgery or radiation in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC, during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”)\nCongress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher\nobjective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.\n● In July 2024, Checkpoint, announced the FDA had accepted for review its resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab,. The resubmission has been\naccepted as a complete response to the complete response letter received in December 2023, and the FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of\nDecember 28, 2024.\n● Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s\nImmuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer\nT cells.\n● Cosibelimab was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Checkpoint.\nEmrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg, also known as DFD-29, for the treatment of rosacea)\n● In November 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg) for the\ntreatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates\ninitial supply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.\n● The approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical\ntrials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi\ndemonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for\nInvestigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.\n● In October 2024, data assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics “(PK”) of oral DFD-29 (versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules\n(Oracea®) in healthy subjects were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. DFD-29 40mg showed higher dermal\nconcentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, which may translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients\nwith rosacea.\n● In March 2024, the FDA accepted the NDA for DFD-29 and set a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024.\n● Emrosi (DFD-29) was developed for the treatment of rosacea at our partner company, Journey, in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories\nLtd.\n45\nTable of Contents\nTriplex (cytomegalovirus vaccine)\n● Triplex, a vaccine for control of cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial for adults co-infected with HIV\nand CMV that is now fully enrolled with topline data anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The study aims to show that vaccination with\nTriplex can safely elicit a CMV-specific immune response and reduce asymptomatic CMV replication in a population of people with HIV on\nsuppressive antiretroviral therapy. The study will also evaluate whether this intervention might reduce chronic inflammation and immune\nactivation, as compared to placebo, and thus, potentially reduce related mortality and morbidity.\n● In May 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex in patients\nundergoing liver transplantation. The trial is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases (“NIH/NIAID”) that could provide over $20 million in non-dilutive funding and will be conducted in up to 20 nationally recognized\ntransplant centers in the United States.\n● Triplex is currently the subject of multiple ongoing clinical trials, including: a Phase 2 evaluation for CMV control in recipients of liver transplant\n(NCT06075745); a Phase 1/2 trial for CMV control in pediatric recipients of HCT (NCT03354728); a Phase 2 trial for safety and immunogenicity\nin adults living with HIV and CMV (NCT05099965); a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of stem cell transplant in which the stem cell\ndonor is vaccinated with Triplex (NCT06059391) and a Phase 1 trial of Triplex in combination with a bi-specific CMV/CD19 Chimeric Antigen\nReceptor T Cell for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT05432635).\n● In 2023, Helocyte additionally entered into an option agreement with City of Hope for exclusive worldwide rights to a novel bispecific CMV/HIV\nCAR T cell therapy (optionally for use in combination with Triplex), which is currently the subject of a Phase 1 trial in adults living with HIV-1\n(see NCT06252402).\n● Triplex was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our subsidiary, Helocyte.\nCAEL-101 (Light chain fibril-reactive monoclonal antibody for AL Amyloidosis)\n● On October 5, 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress for an upfront payment of\napproximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of which approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress. The agreement also\nprovides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders totaling up to $295 million, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and\ncommercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive 42.4% of all potential milestone payments, which together with the upfront payment, would\ntotal up to approximately $182 million.\n● There are two ongoing global Phase 3 studies of CAEL-101 for Mayo Stage IIIa and May Stage IIIb AL amyloidosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov\nidentifiers: NCT04512235 and NCT04504825).\n● CAEL-101 (anselamimab) was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Caelum (founded by Fortress) until its acquisition by AstraZeneca in\nOctober 2021.\nCUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease)\n● In December 2023, our subsidiary, Cyprium, completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl, a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl is obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop\nand commercialize CUTX-101, including the funding of the same. Additionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in\naggregate development and sales milestones under the Agreement and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 ranging from 3% to 12.5% on tiered\nannual net sales. Cyprium will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at the New Drug Application\n(“NDA”) approval for CUTX-101.\n● The rolling NDA for CUTX-101 was completed by Sentynl in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n● CUTX-101 was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Cyprium until the asset transfer in December 2023.\nEarly Stage Product Candidates\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T-cell therapy)\n● In March 2024, we announced our expansion into autoimmune diseases with MB-106, a personalized CD20-targeted, 3rd-generation autologous\nCAR T-cell therapy. Planning for a proof-of concept Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating MB-106 in autoimmune diseases is\nunderway.\n● In June 2024, we announced updated data for MB-106 showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile in patients with Waldenstrom\nmacroglobulinemia (“WM”), a rare form of blood cancer. There was an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 90% in the cohort with durable\nresponses observed, including three complete responses (“CR”), two very good partial responses (“VGPR”), and four partial responses, and one\npatient remains in complete remission at 31 months.\n● MB-106 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.\n46\nTable of Contents\nDotinurad (urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout)\n● In July 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement, and related agreements (collectively, the “Transaction\nDocuments”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation founded in 2023 and seeded by leading life\nsciences institutional investors. Urica transferred rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout,\ndotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock\nequal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity including certain anti-dilution provisions through the raise of $150 million in equity securities. The\nTransaction Documents also granted Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, and\nreceive nominal cash reimbursement payments for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad.\n● Dotinurad was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral therapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad was efficacious and well-tolerated\nin more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58 weeks in Phase 3 clinical trials.\n● Dotinurad was sourced by Fortress and was in development at Urica until dotinurad was acquired by Crystalys in July 2024.\nMB-109 (IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T Cells (MB-101) + HSV-1 oncolytic virus (MB-108))\n● In November 2024, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1\n(“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma.\n● In March 2024, data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating MB-101 IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T-cells in high-grade glioma were published in Nature\nMedicine. MB-101 was well tolerated and 50% of patients achieved stable disease or better, with two partial responses and two complete\nresponses in high grade glioma patients. The two patients who achieved complete response both had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T-cells pre-\ntherapy (i.e., “hot” tumors), and their responses lasted 7.5 and 66+ months, respectively. In the cohort with dual intratumoral (ICT) /\nintraventricular (ICV) delivery and an optimized manufacturing process there was a ~70% improvement in median overall survival (10.2 months)\ncompared to the expected survival rate of six months in this patient population.\n● MB-101, MB-108, and MB-109 are currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.\nAJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer)\n● In May 2024, we announced that last patient completed dosing in a Phase 1b/2a study, which is evaluating AJ201 in the U.S. for the treatment of\nspinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy’s Disease. Kennedy’s Disease is a debilitating rare genetic neuromuscular disease\nprimarily affecting men. Topline data for the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 in SBMA are expected around year-end 2024.\n● AJ201 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Avenue.\nGeneral Corporate\n● In July 2024, Checkpoint raised gross proceeds of $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at the-the-market under Nasdaq rules.\n● In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable\nPerpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest\nof the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. The pausing of these\ndividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the\nmonthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should\nbe lifted.\n● Also in July 2024, Journey Medical entered into an amendment of its existing credit facility with SWK, increasing the amount of the facility from\n$20 million to $25 million.\n● Additionally in July 2024, Fortress announced the reduction of total debt outstanding and the entry into a new $50 million term loan with Oaktree\nCapital Management with a maturity in 2027. The Company borrowed $35.0 million under the agreement on the closing date and is eligible to\ndraw up to an additional $15.0 million at the lenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. In connection with the new\nterm loan, Fortress repaid the prior $50 million term loan with Oaktree.\n● In September 2024, Fortress raised gross proceeds of $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements.\n● In October 2024, Mustang raised $4 million in a warrant exercise and concurrent private placement.\n● In November 2024, Checkpoint raised $9.2 million in a warrant exercise.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared\nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the\nappropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities. The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and related\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under\nthe circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on\nMarch 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies from\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) the\nmarket value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently\ncompleted fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than\n$250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held\nby non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we chose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial\nstatements in the 2023 Form 10-K, have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and certain other matters.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but\ndoes not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but\nretains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-\ncontrolling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are\neliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as\ncalculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s ownership of the issued and outstanding common and preferred shares in certain consolidated Fortress\nsubsidiaries as of the period presented:\nSeptember 30,\nPartner Company/Subsidiary 2024\nAvenue1 4.2%\nCellvation 79.2%\nCheckpoint1 9.7%\nCyprium 75.0%\nHelocyte 83.0%\nJourney1 47.6%\nMustang1 7.4%\nOncogenuity 73.5%\nUrica 68.4%\nNote 1: Denotes entities that are publicly-traded.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue\nProduct revenue, net $ 14,629 $ 15,279 $ (650) (4)%\nCollaboration revenue — 182 (182) (100)%\nRevenue – related party — 31 (31) (100)%\nOther revenue — 19,260 (19,260) (100)%\nNet revenue 14,629 34,752 (20,123) (58)%\nOperating expenses\nCost of goods sold – product revenue 5,285 6,429 (1,144) (18)%\nResearch and development 9,446 20,288 (10,842) (53)%\nResearch and development – licenses acquired — 60 (60) (100)%\nSelling, general and administrative 21,993 21,733 260 1%\nTotal operating expenses 36,724 48,510 (11,786) (24)%\nLoss from operations (22,095) (13,758) (8,337) 61%\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income 589 547 42 8%\nInterest expense and financing fee (6,209) (2,534) (3,675) 145%\nGain on common stock warrant liabilities 19 4,542 (4,523) (100)%\nOther income 1,071 620 451 73%\nTotal other income (expense) (4,530) 3,175 (7,705) (243)%\nLoss before income tax expense (26,625) (10,583) (16,042) 152%\nIncome tax expense 69 141 (72) (51)%\nNet Loss (26,694) (10,724) (15,970) 149%\nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling interest 13,827 5,679 8,148 143%\nNet loss attributable to Fortress $ (12,867) $ (5,045) $ (7,822) 155%\n49\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue\nProduct revenue, net $ 14,629 $ 15,279 $ (650) (4)%\nCollaboration revenue — 182 (182) (100)%\nRevenue – related party — 31 (31) (100)%\nOther revenue — 19,260 (19,260) (100)%\nNet revenue $ 14,629 $ 34,752 $ (20,123) (58)%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 we generated $14.6 million of net revenue related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $34.8 million of net revenue, of which $15.3 million relates to the sale of Journey’s branded\nand generic products, $0.2 million relates to Cyprium’s collaboration revenue with Sentynl, and other revenue of approximately $19.3 million, which\nincludes Journey’s receipt of royalties from its exclusive out-licensing partner for Qbrexza in Japan, Maruho, as well as a $19 million non-refundable\nupfront payment from Maruho related to a license granted by Journey to Maruho for the development and commercialization of Qbrexza in additional\nterritories in Asia. Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from Maruho.\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the net decrease in revenue of $20.1 million, or 58%, is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million up-front\npayment received in the third quarter of 2023 related to Qbrexza territory licensing. Journey’s $0.7 million, or 4%, decrease in product revenue is due\nprimarily to a $0.6 million decrease in net product revenue from legacy products. Qbrexza net product revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, to $7.6\nmillion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $5.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, with the increase\nprimarily driven by additional volume, due to Journey’s continued marketing efforts and the recent expansion of access and coverage platforms related to\nQbrexza. This revenue increase was offset by a decrease in Accutane revenue of $0.9 million, or 18%, and a combined decrease in Amzeeq and Zilxi of\n$0.9 million, or 30%. Accutane’s decrease is attributed to recent market competition, and Amzeeq and Zilxi revenue is down due to a slight decrease in unit\nsales volume and an increase in coupon rebates as a result of the expansion of Journey’s patient coverage options under its overall market access program\ndriving average selling prices lower as compared to the prior year quarter.\nCollaboration revenue related to Cyprium’s agreement with Sentynl was fully recognized as of December 31, 2023 due to Sentynl’s assumption of control\nof the CUTX-101 development program in December 2023.\nCost of Goods Sold\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nCost of goods sold – product revenue $ 5,285 $ 6,429 $ (1,144) (18)%\nWe incurred $5.3 million and $6.4 million of costs of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18% quarter-over-quarter, with the decrease mainly due to\n$0.6 million in inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease of $0.2 million in product royalties from the same period in 2023,\nresulting from lower sales of Accutane and the contractual expiration of the Exelderm product royalty in November 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-\nbased compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third\nparty contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and\nmanufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents, laboratory costs and other supplies.\n50\nTable of Contents\nFor the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were approximately $9.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively.\nThe table below provides a summary of research and development by entity, for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nResearch & development\nFortress $ 452 $ 515 $ (63) (12)%\nSubsidiaries/Partner Companies:\nAvenue 2,264 831 1,433 172%\nCheckpoint 6,366 5,495 871 16%\nJMC 842 2,229 (1,387) (62)%\nMustang (6) 9,424 (9,430) (100)%\nOther1 (472) 1,794 (2,266) (126)%\nTotal research & development expense $ 9,446 $ 20,288 $ (10,842) (53)%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\nThe decrease in research and development spending at Mustang of $9.4 million is primarily attributed to decreased expenses of $1.6 million for personnel\nrelated costs, primarily driven by the reduction in workforce, a decrease of $1.5 million of expense incurred for uBriGene services, a $1.5 million decrease\nin vector costs, a $2.5 million decrease in lab supplies, a $1.0 million decrease in program related expenses and a $0.9 million decrease in consulting\nexpenses. The decrease in Other of $2.3 million is due to a decrease in clinical costs at Urica of $1.8 million related to the Phase 1b trial and the sale of the\nasset to Crystalys, and a decrease in research and development costs of $1.0 million at Cyprium due to the asset transfer of CUTX-101 to Sentynl in 2023,\noffset by an increase of $0.4 million in license costs at both Helocyte and Cellvation. Journey’s decrease of $1.4 million is primarily driven by lower\nclinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. Avenue’s increase in research and development expense of $1.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nis primarily attributable to an increase in clinical development costs related to AJ201. Checkpoint’s increased research and development expense of $0.9\nmillion is due to increased commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $1.1 million due to manufacturing costs incurred to build inventory to\nsupport a potential product launch, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates.\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development expense for\nthe periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nStock-based compensation - research & development\nFortress $ 444 $ 401 $ 43 11%\nSubsidiaries/Partner Companies:\nAvenue 89 144 (55) (38)%\nCheckpoint 543 303 240 79%\nJMC 150 24 126 525%\nMustang (10) (18) 8 (44)%\nOther1 — 1 (1) (100)%\nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development 1,216 855 361 42%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n51\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our\ncommercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in\nresearch and development expenses.

Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from\nMaruho.\nThe net decrease in revenue of $22.0 million or 34% is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million payment received from Maruho related to territory\nlicensing for Qbrexza in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue from Journey’s legacy products decreased by $1.9 million, or 41%, to\n$2.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $4.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the\ncontinued price erosion of Targadox from generic competition.\nCost of Goods Sold\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nCost of goods sold – product revenue $ 18,642 $ 20,645 $ (2,003) (10)%\nCosts of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.6\nmillion and $20.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold of $2.0 million, or 10%, is mainly due to product royalties that were lower by\n$1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to the contractual expiration of Journey’s Exelderm product royalty in November 2023, the\ncontractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty in the second quarter of 2023, and the discontinuation of Ximino in September of 2023. In addition, the\ndiscontinuation of Ximino has resulted in lower PDUFA fees of $0.8 million and lower non-cash license amortization of $0.5 million. These decreases\nwere offset by an increase in product costs of $0.5 million, as a result of product mix, mainly driven by the higher Accutane net product revenue.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-\nbased compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third\nparty contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and\nmanufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents, laboratory costs and other supplies.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were approximately $47.1 million and $87.7 million,\nrespectively.

Checkpoint’s reduced research and development expense of $15.9 million\nis due to reduced commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $9.5 million related to manufacturing costs incurred in the prior period to build\ninventory to support a potential product launch of cosibelimab, reduced regulatory expenses of $3.5 million as prior period costs included $3.2 million for\nthe PDUFA fee for the BLA filing of cosibelimab in the first quarter of 2023, and a $2.1 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates. Journey’s\nincreased research and development costs of $3.6 million are due to the $4.1 million filing fee payment made to the FDA in January 2024 for the DFD-29\nNDA submission in addition to the $3.0 million contractual milestone payment made to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. triggered by the FDA’s acceptance\nof the DFD-29 NDA in March 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses incurred by Journey as the clinical program was\nconcluded.\nNoncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $2.9\nmillion and $2.3 million, respectively.\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nStock-based compensation - research & development\nFortress $ 1,319 $ 1,200 $ 119 10%\nPartner Companies:\nAvenue 179 150 29 19%\nCheckpoint 1,629 880 748 85%\nJMC 466 88 377 426%\nMustang (650) — (650) 100%\nOther1 — 1 (1) (100)%\nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development $ 2,943 2,319 $ 624 27%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\nWe expect research and development costs to remain lower in 2024 due to portfolio optimization and assets completing pivotal trials in 2023 and entering\nregistration and approval stages.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our\ncommercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in\nresearch and development expenses.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs at Mustang is attributable to\ncontinued cost reduction efforts and optimization relating to personnel, consulting, and infrastructure. The decrease in Other is led by reduced professional\nfees and legal spending at Urica and Cyprium. The increase of $1.3 million at Checkpoint is attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of\n$0.6 million due to new employee grants, and an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million.\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense for\nthe periods presented.\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nStock-based compensation - Selling, general and administrative\nFortress $ 6,280 $ 6,787 $ (507) (7)%\nPartner Companies:\nAvenue 535 449 86 19%\nCheckpoint 1,862 1,345 517 38%\nJMC 4,254 1,989 2,265 114%\nMustang 150 380 (230) (61)%\nOther1 407 56 350 621%\nTotal stock-based compensation expense - selling, general and administrative $ 13,488 11,006 $ 2,482 23%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly lower for 2024.\nAsset Impairment\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred impairment charges of $2.6 million attributable to Mustang’s assessment of the recoverability\nof the asset group consisting of its leasehold improvements and the associated right-of-use asset. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Journey\nrecorded a loss on the impairment of intangible assets of $3.1 million related to the impairment of the Ximino intangible asset, due to lower net product\nrevenue and gross profit levels for the Ximino products.\nOther Expense\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nOther expense\nInterest income $ 2,157 $ 2,296 $ (139) (6)%\nInterest expense and financing fee (10,933) (13,255) 2,322 (18)%\nGain (loss) on common stock warrant liabilities (578) 10,708 (11,286) (105)%\nOther income (expense) 1,334 (2,049) 3,383 (165)%\nTotal other expense $ (8,020) (2,300) $ (5,720) 249%\nTotal other expense increased $5.7 million, or 249%, from expense of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to expense of $8.0\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of $11.3 million in the gain on common stock warrant liabilities,\noffset by the $2.3 million decrease in interest expense and financing fees due to debt paid off by JMC and Mustang in 2023, as well as the $3.4 million\nincrease in other income due in part to Journey’s $1.1 million gain on the extinguishment of short-term debt related to installment payments for the license\nof Ximino. Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of a $4.1 million loss on the deconsolidation of Aevitas, offset by\nMustang’s gain on the sale of assets to uBriGene of $1.4 million, and grant income of $0.7 million.\n56\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe will require additional financing to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for our existing and new product\ncandidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for our potential products, and sales\nand marketing capabilities. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities.

We believe that our current cash\nand cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material\nadverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. We may seek funds through equity or debt financings, joint\nventure or similar development collaborations, the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, royalty financings, or through other sources of financing; the\nrising interest rate environment may cause the Company to pay more interest on its various debt instruments, which could lead to higher operating\nexpenses.\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nComponents of cash flows from publicly-traded partner companies comprise:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n($ in thousands) Fortress1 Avenue Checkpoint JMC Mustang Total\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (14,333) $ (8,262) $ (23,924) $ (11,352) $ (9,413) $ (67,284)\nInvesting activities — — — — — —\nFinancing activities (643) 9,076 23,699 6,374 6,329 44,835\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash $ (14,976) $ 814 $ (225) $ (4,978) $ (3,084) $ (22,449)\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\n($ in thousands) Fortress1 Avenue Checkpoint JMC Mustang Total\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (24,943) $ (7,127) $ (40,757) $ 21,760 $ (42,223) $ (93,290)\nInvesting activities 44 (3,000) — (5,000) 5,916 (2,040)\nFinancing activities 9,131 3,580 30,461 (24,014) (30,037) (10,879)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (15,768) $ (6,547) $ (10,296) $ (7,254) $ (66,344) $ (106,209)\nNote 1: Includes Fortress, non-public subsidiaries and elimination entries.\nCash flows on a consolidated basis are as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (67,284) $ (93,290) $ 26,006\nInvesting activities — (2,040) 2,040\nFinancing activities 44,835 (10,879) 55,714\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (22,449) $ (106,209) $ 83,760\n57\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $26.0 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the decrease of $30.6 million in net loss, the $11.1 million decrease in the expense associated with\nsubsidiaries/partner companies’ warrant liabilities, and the $8.0 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by\nthe $3.1 million change in the expense for research and development – licenses acquired, $4.1 million change in the expense for loss from deconsolidation\nand dissolution of subsidiaries, and $3.1 million for Journey’s asset impairment loss in the prior period.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is a\ndecrease of $2.0 million, due to JMC’s $5.0 million used in investing activities for the deferred cash payment made to VYNE related to the acquisition of\nAmzeeq and Zilxi and Avenue’s $3.0 million cash payment towards the purchase of the AnnJi license, each in the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\noffset by Mustang’s $6.0 million proceeds from the sale of assets to uBriGene in July 2023, and no comparable activities in the period ended September\n30, 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $44.8 million of net cash provided by\nfinancing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $55.7 million. The increase is attributable to the funds used in the prior\nperiod to pay off partner companies’ long-term debt of $50.4 million and JMC’s line of credit of $30.9 million, offset by loan proceeds of $38.7 million,\nproceeds from partner companies’ sale of stock, options and warrants of $37.1 million in the current period.\nWe fund our operations through cash on hand, the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, and from the\nproceeds resulting from the exercise of warrants and stock options.

OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThere are no reportable events or material developments with respect to previously disclosed proceedings for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. To our\nknowledge, except as previously disclosed, there are no legal proceedings pending against us, other than routine actions and administrative proceedings,\nand other actions not deemed material are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In\nthe ordinary course of business, however, the Company may be subject to both insured and uninsured litigation. Suits and claims may be brought against\nthe Company by customers, suppliers, partners and/or third parties (including tort claims for personal injury arising from clinical trials of the Company’s\nproduct candidates and property damage) alleging deficiencies in performance, breach of contract, etc., and seeking resulting alleged damages.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Common Stock, our 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value (the “Series A Preferred\nStock”) or any other type of equity or debt securities we may issue from time to time (together our “Securities”) involves a high degree of risk. You should\nconsider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q including\nthe consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as the risks, uncertainties and other information set forth in the reports and other\nmaterials filed or furnished by our partner companies Avenue, Checkpoint, Journey and Mustang with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our Securities.\nIf any of the following risks or the risks included in the public filings of Avenue, Checkpoint, Journey or Mustang were to materialize, our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nSecurities could decline, and you could lose part of or all of your investment in our Securities. In addition, you should be aware that the below stated risks\nshould be read as being applicable to our subsidiaries and partner companies such that, if any of the negative outcomes associated with any such risk is\nexperienced by one of our subsidiaries or partner companies, the value of Fortress’ holdings in such entity may decline. As used throughout this filing, the\nwords “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group,\nas dictated by context.\n62\nTable of Contents\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development\nMost of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized, and the product\ncandidates that do advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nMost of our existing product candidates remain in the early stages of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures, development,\ntesting and regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval processes can take many years, and it is unlikely\nthat our product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA and/or foreign equivalent regulatory bodies, would be commercially\navailable for several years. Only a small percentage of drugs under development successfully obtain regulatory approval and are successfully\ncommercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot be sure that any of our\nproduct candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. Before we may seek regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will\nbe required to demonstrate, through well-controlled clinical trials, that our product candidates are effective and have a favorable benefit-risk profile for\ntheir target indications. Success in early clinical trials is not necessarily indicative of success in later stage clinical trials, during which product candidates\nmay fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, despite having progressed through initial clinical testing, which may cause significant setbacks.\nFurther, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical\ntrials may never receive regulatory approval.\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates for fewer or more limited indications\nthan we request, may place limitations on our ability to commercialize products at the intended price points, may grant approval contingent on the\nproduct’s performance in costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the\nsuccessful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings, contraindications, or\nprecautions that limit the commercialization of the product. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), or foreign equivalent, may schedule one\nor more of our product candidates under the Controlled Substances Act, or its foreign equivalent, which could impede such product’s commercial viability.\nAny of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\nThe extensive regulation to which our product candidates are subject may be costly and time consuming, cause anticipated or unanticipated delays,\nand/or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for commercialization.\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and\ndistribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by\ncomparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product candidate until the FDA approves such\nproduct candidate’s BLA or NDA. The approval process is uncertain, expensive, often spans many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type,\ncomplexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition to significant and expansive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain\nmarketing approval for product candidates depends on the results of required non-clinical testing, including the characterization of the manufactured\ncomponents of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes.\nThe FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes, testing procedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Further, the\nFDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process and may change approval policies or interpretations of regulations at any time,\nwhich could delay, limit or preclude a product candidate’s approval.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or refuse approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n● disagreement with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use of clinical trial methods and methods of data\nanalysis;\n● an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and/or effective for an indication;\n● the FDA’s rejection of clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially\ndifferent from that of the United States;\n63\nTable of Contents\n● the FDA’s determination that clinical trial results do not meet the statistical significance levels required for approval;\n● a disagreement by the applicable regulator regarding the interpretation of preclinical study or trial data;\n● determination by the FDA that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators\ncontract for clinical supplies or plan to contract for commercial supplies, do not satisfactorily comply with cGMPs; or\n● a change to the FDA’s approval policies or interpretation of regulations rendering our clinical data, product characteristics, or benefit-risk profile\ninsufficient or unfavorable for approval.\nForeign approval procedures vary by country and may, in addition to the aforementioned risks, involve additional product testing, administrative review\nperiods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions\nabout the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining\nregulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals may prevent us from commercializing our product\ncandidates.\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials, or suspensions or terminations of such trials, could result in increased costs and/or delay our ability\nto pursue regulatory approvals.\nThe commencement or resumption of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:\n● obtaining regulatory approval to commence or resume a clinical trial;\n● identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n● reaching and maintaining agreements on acceptable terms with CROs and trial sites, the terms of which may be subject to extensive negotiation\nand modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n● obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n● developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n● adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;\n● the death, disability, departure or other change to the principal investigator or other staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;\n● identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or\n● retaining patients who participate in a clinical trial and replacing those who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient\nefficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the\nfactors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the termination of a given development program or\nthe denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf any of our product candidates causes unacceptable adverse safety events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or\ncommercialize such product, preventing us from generating revenue from such products’ sale. Alternatively, even if a product candidate is approved for\nmarketing, future adverse events could lead to the withdrawal of such product from the market.\n64\nTable of Contents\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and/or delay or prevent our ability to complete development of\nthat product candidate or generate product revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the\nproximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of\nambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements\nand on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring\ncommittee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors,\nincluding, but not necessarily limited to:\n● failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n● inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical\nhold;\n● stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n● unforeseen safety or chemistry, manufacturing and control issues, or other determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\nand\n● lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nRegulatory requirements and guidance may change, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any such change may\nrequire us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs, which may in turn impact a clinical trial’s cost, timing, and likelihood of success. If any clinical trial\nis delayed, suspended, or terminated, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed, and the commercial prospects, if\nany, for the product candidate may suffer. In addition, many of these factors may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product\ncandidate.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved more quickly,\nmarketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidates will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in\nthe development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and\npharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the\nincidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. Any of these developments may render one or more of our product candidates\nobsolete or noncompetitive.\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial opportunity for one\nor more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-\nlicensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n● capital resources;\n● development resources, including personnel and technology;\n● clinical trial experience;\n● regulatory experience;\n● expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and\n● manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may obtain patent\nprotection or other intellectual property or exclusivity rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Our\ncompetitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and/or less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing\nand marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative\narrangements with large and established companies. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient\nregistration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage public\nperception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nIf any of the technologies underpinning our product candidates, including gene therapy, is claimed to be unsafe, such product candidate may not gain the\nacceptance of the public or the medical community. The success of our gene therapy platforms in particular depends upon physicians who specialize in\ntreating the diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments involving our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, treatments with\nwhich they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion\nwould have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates,\nand the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or\napproval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in\ndemand for any such product candidates. Concern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the\ncommercialization of our products.\nThe making, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances are subject to regulation by state, federal and foreign law\nenforcement and other regulatory agencies.\nControlled substances are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and\ndistribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) and regulations of the DEA. IV tramadol,\nunder development by our partner company Avenue, will be subject to these regulations.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse and\nno established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V,\nwith Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such\nsubstances.\nVarious states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are\nseparate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states\nthere must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain\nfederal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain\nseparate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to\nmeet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising\nunder federal law.\nFor any of our products classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to\nobtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and\nforeign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. There is a risk that\nDEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product candidates and the ability to produce and distribute our\nproducts in the volume needed to both meet commercial demand and build inventory to mitigate possible supply disruptions.\n66\nTable of Contents\nRegulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas,\nrecordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development\nand commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered\nestablishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could\ndelay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action.\nThe DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances,\nviolations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our product\ncandidates that are classified as controlled substances, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and\nresults of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nThe FDA limits regulatory approval for our product candidates to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have\nbeen demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases set forth in the approval for which a product is\ndeemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product\nalso requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market\nand sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s label or that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved\nby the regulatory authorities (“off label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA.\nSuch off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances.\nRegulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine or behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory\nauthorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies regarding the promotion of off-label use.\nIf our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions, including\nWarning Letters or Untitled Letters, by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and\nadvertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall, institute fines, or could result in\ndisgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a product candidate satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the\nrequirements for such product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for the product candidate will likely take\nsignificantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be\nsuccessful.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA.\nSection 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted\nby or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would\nallow an NDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of\napproved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that\nwe would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as\nanticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory\napproval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks\nassociated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain more additional funding, which could result in\nsignificant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot\nassure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2)\nregulatory pathway would likely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely\nmaterially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot\nassure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization in a timely manner, or at all.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name\npharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is\nsuccessfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any\nNDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to\nspecial requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These\nrequirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of\nany litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose\nadditional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the\nnew product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the\npetition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster\nproduct development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which\nthe products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor\nthe safety or efficacy of the products.\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\nWe have historically financed a significant portion of our growth and operations in part through the assumption of debt. Should an event of default\noccur under any applicable loan documents, our business would be materially adversely affected. Further, our current credit arrangement with\nOaktree restricts our and certain of our subsidiaries’ and partner companies’ abilities to take certain actions.\nAt September 30, 2024, the total amount of debt outstanding, net of the debt discount, was $52.5 million. If we default on our obligations, the holders of\nour debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest, and/or take possession of any pledged collateral. If an\nevent of default occurs, we may be unable to cure it within the applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may\nnot have sufficient funds available for repayment and we may be unable to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on\nterms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, current or future debt obligations may limit our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs, or to\nengage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Such restrictions may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our\nbusiness and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nOn August 27, 2020, we entered into a $60 million senior secured credit agreement (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the “Oaktree\nNote”) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, “Oaktree”). On July 25, 2024, we, as\nborrower, entered into a $50.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the “New Oaktree Agreement”) with Oaktree. We borrowed $35.0 million under\nthe Agreement on the date of the agreement and are eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million with the lenders’ consent. The New Oaktree\nAgreement replaces the Prior Oaktree Agreement. The New Oaktree Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among\nother things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other\ndistributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that\nwe maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement, and (ii) that product net\nsales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month basis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or\nincreased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain exclusions. Failure by the Company to comply\nwith the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test. The breach of any\nother such provisions (even, potentially, in an immaterial manner) could result in an event of default under the New Oaktree Agreement, the announcement\nand impact of which could have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. The restrictions imposed by such provisions may also inhibit our\nand certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies’ ability to enter into certain transactions or arrangements that management otherwise believes would\nbe in our or such partner companies’ best interests, such as dispositions that would result in cash inflows to Fortress and/or our subsidiaries and partner\ncompanies, or acquisitions or financings that would promote future growth.\n68\nTable of Contents\nWe have a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will be able to\nsustain current revenues or whether we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $86.5 million and $122.7 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $142.3 million and $203.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and\nincur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future, and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and\nclinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth\nstrategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of\nincreased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to\nyear. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n● one or more of our development-stage product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we decide to commercialize such product(s)\nourselves, due to the need to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product without substantial\ndelays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution,\ncash collection and related commercial activities;\n● we are required by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n● there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;\n● we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, depending on the timing of payments we may make or receive under these\narrangements;\n● there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n● we become involved in any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits; and\n● there are any regulatory developments affecting our competitors’ product candidates.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our development stage\nproducts, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such development-stage products. Our ability to generate revenue from such\ndevelopment-stage products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n● obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire in the future;\n● manufacture commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at acceptable cost\nlevels; and\n● develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our product\ncandidates or any future product candidate, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain\nprofitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and\ndevelopment efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. A decline in the value of our company could\nalso cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n69\nTable of Contents\nTo fund our operations and service our debt securities, which may be deemed to include our Series A Preferred Stock, we will be required to generate a\nsignificant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to\nmeet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could\ncause the market value of our Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock to decline.\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments\non our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have\ndone in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will\ndepend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of\nthose capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any\nrefinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our\nbusiness operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable\nterms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market\nvalue of our Securities to decline.\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by Journey and its ability to make such cash available to us, by\ndividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Journey may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in\nrespect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries and partner companies, including Journey, is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances,\nlegal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and partner companies.\nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the capital\nmarkets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We\ncan provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of\nour cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our competitive position and results of\noperations.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or\nmore of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts or planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth strategy.\nOur R&D programs will require substantial additional capital for research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, establishing pilot scale and commercial\nscale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establishing and developing quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, and administrative capabilities\nto support these programs. We expect to fund our R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in\nvarious past, ongoing, and future collaborations, and through additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress the\ntrading prices of our Securities. If additional funds are required to support our operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may\nnot be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred\nR&D expenses of approximately $46.9 million and $92.0 million, respectively, and during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred\nR&D expenses of approximately $101.7 million and $134.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth\nstrategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the\nnext 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue\nand achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs.\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our\npublic float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf\nregistration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the “baby shelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to\nuse the highest closing sales price of our common stock (or the average of the last bid and last ask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days\nof sales under the registration statement to calculate our public float.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAs of the date of the 2023 Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of the filing of the 2023 Form 10-\nK, and until we again have a public float with a value in exceeds of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our\npublic float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our\nForm S-3 shelf registration statements will also decrease.\nOur ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration\nor modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for\nadditional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner or on different terms than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and\npotentially change our growth strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of\noperations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. The terms of our existing debt arrangements, including that with Oaktree, have\nand will continue to inhibit our and our subsidiaries’ abilities to raise capital.\nWe may be unable to generate returns for our investors if our partner companies and subsidiaries, several of which have limited or no operating\nhistory, have no commercialized revenue generating products or, if not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party financing.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial financial and operational commitments in our subsidiaries,\nwhich often have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund\nproduct and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on the ability of one or more of our subsidiaries and/or partner\ncompanies to innovate, in-license, develop or acquire successful biopharmaceutical products and/or acquire companies in increasingly competitive and\nhighly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing to\ncommercialize products or are not acquired in change-of-control transactions that result in cash distributions, as applicable, the value of our businesses and\nour ownership stakes in our partner companies may be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict\nour operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing Common Stock (or other Securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common\nStock), the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have also entered into financing arrangements to raise capital for our subsidiaries\nunder which Common Stock is or may be issuable to investors in lieu of cash, upon certain conditions being met; in the event such issuances take place,\nthey will also be dilutive of the stakes of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings may impose covenants that restrict our operations, including by\nlimiting our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain financial commitments and engage in certain merger,\nconsolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it\nmay be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe have paused dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and may not be able to resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred\nStock in the future if we have insufficient cash or available “surplus” as defined under Delaware law to make such dividend payments.\nOn July 5, 2024, our board of directors paused the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock until further notice. However, dividends on our\nSeries A Preferred Stock accrue daily, are payable monthly and will continue to accrue from the last date of payment. Our board of directors deemed the\nforegoing to be in the best interests of the Company and its common stockholders in light of the Company’s current and anticipated financial condition and\noutlook, and after considering its fiduciary duties to the Company’s common stockholders and other relevant factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on\nour Series A Preferred Stock in the future requires us to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital, and\nthat we have sufficient working capital in order to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business. Our ability to pay dividends\nmay also be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and\nother factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash or “surplus” to resume\npayment of the cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in a timely manner, or at all.\n71\nTable of Contents\nWe have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future, except for the dividend we previously paid on our Series A\nPreferred Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we previously paid on shares of our Series A\nPreferred Stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses, and retain our stock\npositions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash or stock dividends. Equally, each of our\nsubsidiaries and partner companies is governed by its own board of directors with individual governance and decision-making regimes and mandates to\noversee such entities in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we alone cannot determine the acts that could maximize value to you\nof such partner companies and subsidiaries in which we maintain ownership positions, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital\nappreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for holders of our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock and other securities to fund our operations, and our future ability to obtain additional\ncapital through stock sales or other securities offerings may be more costly than in the past, or may not be available to us at all.\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock to fund our operations. For example, we raised an aggregate of approximately $30.2\nmillion in gross proceeds in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and $6.5 million in gross proceeds in fiscal 2024 to date through the sale of shares of our common\nstock and other securities in offerings made under a Form S-3 “shelf” registration statement. Using a shelf registration statement to conduct an equity\noffering to raise capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration\nstatement. We are no longer eligible to file any new shelf registration statements due to non-payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock since\nJuly 5, 2024 and, if we do not resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, pay all accumulated dividends and otherwise remain\ncompliant with the other conditions for use of a Form S-3 registration statement by the time we file our next Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will lose the\nability to use our currently effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3. Accordingly, we may then only be able to conduct additional offerings of\nour securities under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement. We would expect either of these\nalternatives to be a more expensive method of raising additional capital and more dilutive to our stockholders relative to using a shelf registration\nstatement.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation\nFuture revenue based on sales of our dermatology products, Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Targadox, Exelderm and Luxamend, may be lower\nthan expected or lower than in previous periods.\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products through our partner\ncompany Journey. Any setback that may occur with respect to such products could significantly impair our financial condition, cash flows and/or operating\nresults and/or reduce the value of our Securities. Setbacks for such products could include, but are not limited to, issues related to: supply chain, shipping;\ndistribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product quality; marketing; government regulation, including but not limited to pricing or\nreimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with existing or new products, including third-party generic competition;\nproduct acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical professionals, and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls. Also, a\nsignificant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic\ncompetition; the introduction of new competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, could have a significant adverse effect\non our operating income.\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity.\nJourney’s products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We face increased\ncompetition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of our\nproducts. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through\nlitigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings,\nif a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is\notherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result.\n72\nTable of Contents\nA significant portion of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic\ncompetition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on our operating income. Three of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi, and Emrosi, for which we recently received\nFDA approval, currently have patent protection. Four of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent\nprotection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection.\nAccutane currently competes in the Isotretinoin market with five other therapeutically equivalent A/B rated products. Targadox currently competes with\none therapeutically equivalent A/B rated generic product. Exelderm may face A/B rated generic competition in the future.\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in\npreference to the branded version by third-party payors, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it\nnormally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy\nbenefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared\nwith other forms of care. Any reduction in sales of our products, or the prices we receive for our products as a result of generic competition could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to\ndecline.\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of Journey’s field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on our existing\nrevenue stream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop and for which we receive marketing\nauthorization, will depend on our ability to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to\nmarket, distribute and sell any such products.\nJourney’s field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions to our\nrelationship with such field sales force or the professional employer organization that employs our field sales force, could materially adversely affect our\nproduct sales.\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the establishment of a\ncontract field sales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval is expensive and time-consuming and could delay\nany such product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing\ncapabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract\nwith third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable\nterms, or at all.\nIf our products are not included in managed care organizations’ formularies or coverage by other organizations, our products’ utilization and market\nshares may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn the United States, continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our\nproducts for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative\nauthorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity\nand cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the\nreimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an\nappropriate return on our investment of our currently marketed products or those which we may acquire or develop in the future.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care\norganizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies are based on the prices and\ntherapeutic benefits of available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies\nvaries considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of\nparticular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and\nmarket share of our products. If our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not\nprovided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n73\nTable of Contents\nReimbursement for our products and product candidates may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments, which could make it difficult for us\nto sell our products profitably.\nWe have obtained approval for some products, and intend to seek approval for other product candidates, to commercialize in both the United States and in\ncountries and territories outside the United States. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign countries, we will be subject to rules and regulations in\nthose countries relating to such products. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and\nbiologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the\nreceipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend\nsignificantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by\nexisting and future healthcare reform measures.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which pharmaceuticals they\nwill pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party\npayor’s determination regarding whether a product is:\n● a covered benefit under its health plan;\n● safe, effective and medically necessary;\n● appropriate for the specific patient;\n● cost-effective; and\n● experimental or investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that\ncould require that we provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to\nprovide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in\nscope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Additionally, while we may seek approval\nof our product candidates in combination with each other, there can be no guarantee that we will obtain coverage and reimbursement for any of our\nproducts together, or that such reimbursement will incentivize the use of our products in combination with each other as opposed to in combination with\nother agents which may be priced more favorably to the medical community.\nLegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare systems of the United States and certain foreign countries could impact our ability to sell our products\nprofitably. Several federal agencies including FDA, CMS, DEA and HHS, in addition to state and local governments, regulate drug product development\nand marketing. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) changed the way Medicare covers\nand pays for pharmaceutical products by revising the payment methodology for many products reimbursed by Medicare, resulting in lower rates of\nreimbursement for many types of drugs, and added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program that involves commercial plans negotiating drug\nprices for their members. In addition, this law provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost\nreduction initiatives and other provisions of this law and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products.\nWhile the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in\nsetting their own payment rates. Therefore, any limitations in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in reductions in payments from private\npayors.\nSince 2003, there have been several other legislative and regulatory changes to the coverage and reimbursement landscape for pharmaceuticals. In March\n2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the\n“Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” was enacted and made significant changes to the United States’ healthcare system. The ACA and any revisions or\nreplacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIn the United States there is significant interest in containing healthcare costs and increasing the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. Congress has\ncontinually explored legislation intended to address the cost of prescription drugs. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains substantial drug\npricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would\nrequire manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of\nrebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation,\nand requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions\nin the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement\nwe receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet\nknown.\nWhile we cannot predict what additional proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly change the landscape\nin which the pharmaceutical market operates.\nState legislatures are similarly active in proposing and passing legislation and regulations aimed at controlling pharmaceutical and biological prices and\ndrug cost transparency.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and\ncontaining or lowering the cost of healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in\nthe future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain\nor reduce costs of healthcare and prescription drugs may adversely affect:\n● the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n● our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n● our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;\n● the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n● the availability of capital.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and\nadditional downward pressure on the payment that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government\nhealthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other\nhealthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical\nproducts. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be\nchanged, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidate, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the\nU.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product\nlabeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\n75\nTable of Contents\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\nWe have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size and\nscope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. We have also entered\ninto several arrangements under which we have agreed to contingent dispositions of subsidiaries, partner companies and/or their assets. The failure to\nconsummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative\narrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe have entered into and consummated several partnerships and/or contingent sales of our assets and subsidiaries, including an equity investment and\ncontingent acquisition agreement between Caelum and AstraZeneca (the acquisition component of which has consummated) and a development funding\nand contingent asset purchase between Cyprium and Sentynl (the acquisition component of which has not yet consummated). Each of these arrangements\nhas been time-consuming and has diverted management’s attention. As a result of these consummated/contingent sales, as with other similar transactions\nthat we may complete, we may experience a reduction in the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets, our opportunities with\nrespect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.\nIn addition, in connection with any transaction involving a (contingent or non-contingent) sale of one of our subsidiaries, partner companies or their assets,\nwe may surrender our ability to realize long-term value from such asset or company, in the form of foregone product sales, royalties, milestone payments,\nsublicensing revenue or otherwise, in exchange for upfront and/or other payments. In the event, for instance, that a product candidate underpinning any\nsuch asset or company is granted FDA approval for commercialization following the execution of documentation governing the sale by us of such asset or\ncompany, the transferee of such asset or company may realize tremendous value from commercializing such product, which we would have realized for\nourselves had we not executed such sale transaction and been able to achieve applicable approvals independently.\nShould we seek to enter into collaborations or divestitures with respect to other assets or companies, we may be unable to consummate such arrangements\non satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms within our anticipated timelines. In addition, our ability to identify, enter into and/or consummate\ncollaborations and/or divestitures may be limited by competition we face from other companies in pursuing similar transactions in the biotechnology and\npharmaceutical industries.\nAny collaboration or divestiture we pursue, whether we are able to complete it or not, may be complex, time consuming and expensive, may divert from\nmanagement’s attention, may have a negative impact on our customer relationships, cause us to incur costs associated with maintaining the business of the\ntargeted collaboration or divestiture during the transaction process and also to incur costs of closing and disposing the affected business or transferring the\noperations of the business to other facilities. In addition, if such transactions are not completed for any reason, the market price of our Common Stock may\nreflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market\nof us generally and a decline in the market price of our Securities.\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of the obligations, actions or inactions of certain of our subsidiaries and\npartner companies. We have also entered into, and may again enter into, certain arrangements with our subsidiaries, partner companies and/or third\nparties pursuant to which a substantial number of shares of our capital stock may be issued. Depending on the terms of such arrangements, we may be\ncontractually obligated to pay substantial amounts to third parties, or issue a substantially dilutive number of shares of our capital stock, based on the\nactions or inactions of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies, regulatory agencies or other third parties.\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as indemnitor of potential losses or liabilities that may be experienced by one or more of our subsidiaries, partner\ncompanies and/or their partners or investors. If we become obligated to pay all or a portion of such indemnification amounts, our business and the market\nvalue of our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or debt securities may be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to act as guarantor in connection with equity or debt raises by our partner companies,\npursuant to which we may become obligated either to pay what could be a significant amount of cash or issue what could be a significant number of shares\nof Common Stock or Preferred Stock if certain events occur or do not occur, which could lead to a depletion of resources or dilution to our Common Stock,\nor both.\n76\nTable of Contents\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and product candidates, and if we are unable to do so,\nor to integrate acquired products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or\ntechnologies. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● exposure to unknown liabilities;\n● disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n● difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the current economic\nenvironment;\n● incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n● higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n● increased amortization expenses;\n● difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n● impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n● inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them\ninto our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger biopharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish\nnew collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us and/or may have greater\nexpertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that\nare never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nCertain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles at our partner companies, subsidiaries, related parties and/or other entities with which we\ntransact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, which could result in conflicts of interests relating to ongoing and\nfuture relationships and transactions with these parties.\nWe share directors and/or officers with certain of our subsidiaries, partner companies, related parties and other entities with which we transact business or\nin which we hold significant minority ownership positions, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in the future, including with respect to\nthe allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and procedures to identify and mitigate such conflicts, and\nthat any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such policies or procedures were negotiated at arm’s length in conformity with\nfiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflict of interest, may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such\npotential or perceived conflicts could expose us to lost profits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our financial condition, cash flows and/or\nresults of operations.\nCertain of our executives, directors and principal stockholders, whose interests may be adverse to those of our other stockholders, can control our\ndirection and policies.\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and stockholders own nearly or more than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock and, together with their\naffiliates and related persons, beneficially own a significant percentage of our capital stock. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would\nbe able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors\nand any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our\n77\nTable of Contents\nassets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition,\nthis concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock by:\n● delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n● impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n● discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIf we acquire, enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in, companies in the future, our financial condition, operating results and\nthe value of our Securities may be adversely affected, thereby diluting stockholder value, disrupting our business and/or diminishing the value of our\nholdings in our partner companies.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain significant ownership stakes in other companies. Acquisitions of,\njoint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n● diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n● successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;\n● the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;\n● the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;\n● with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and\n● potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other transaction opportunities, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any\nsuch transaction, we might incur higher costs than anticipated, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable\nactivities.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our business activities.\nAny terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including military conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial\nmarkets and economy. This includes Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and the Hamas and Hezbollah extremist\ngroups, recent attacks by armed groups on cargo ships in the Red Sea, and tensions across the Taiwan Strait. For instance, the United States or other\ncountries may impose sanctions that restrict doing business in the effected countries and increased military conflict may affect third-party vendors and\ncause delays.\nThis risk may be magnified in the case of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s invasion and the ensuing response by Ukraine may disrupt our\npartner companies’ ability to conduct clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, and potentially other neighboring countries. Although the\nimpact of Russia’s military action is highly unpredictable, certain clinical trial sites may be affected, including those of our partner company Checkpoint in\nRussia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia. Those clinical trial sites may suspend or terminate trials, and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to\nrelocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation in clinical trials. For instance, Checkpoint had to terminate their Phase 3 NSCLC trial\nin the first quarter of 2023 as a result of such conflicts. Alternative sites to fully and timely compensate for clinical trial activities in these areas may not be\navailable, and we may need to find other countries to conduct these clinical trials. Clinical trial interruptions may delay our plans for clinical development\nand approvals for our product candidates, which could increase costs and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\n78\nTable of Contents\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies, and we expect to continue\nto rely heavily on such third parties and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates and products, if approved.\nFurther, we rely solely on third parties to manufacture Journey’s commercialized products. Such dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely\nimpact our businesses.\nWe depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms\nto applicable specifications and FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our third-\nparty suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies and\nauthorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers\nhave not complied with cGMPs or comparable regulations, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to clinical hold until such time as we\nare able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable compliance, and commercial product could be unfit for sale, or if distributed, could be\nrecalled from the market. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, or distribution of our\nproducts as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, pass any regulatory\nagency inspection or otherwise perform under our agreements with them could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products\nand product candidates. In addition, several of our currently commercialized products, sold through our partner company Journey, are produced by a single\nmanufacturer, and, although we closely monitor inventory prophylactically, disruptions to such supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet product demand and therefore diminish revenues. Finally, in light of partner company Mustang’s recent reduction in force in April 2024, we may\nincrease our reliance at Mustang on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of one or more\nproduct candidates for which our collaborators or we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party\nmanufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms, and even if we are able to establish such agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance entails\nadditional risks.\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the raw materials and equipment necessary to produce product candidates\nfor anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those\nproducts. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we\ncurrently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials since such agreements are entered into by our third-party\nmanufacturers and their qualified suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of raw material components related to an ongoing clinical trial could\nconsiderably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to engage in our own commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if they received marketing\napproval, and would likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply\nclinical trial materials, as well as our planned dependence on third party manufacturers for any products that may be approved, may adversely affect our\nability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition to the manufacturing and supply functions they\nprovide, third-party manufacturers also play a key role in our efforts to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, by interacting with,\nproviding important information to, and hosting inspections by, applicable regulatory authorities. If a given contract development and manufacturing\norganization upon whom we rely in such a capacity is unwilling or unable to perform these activities on our behalf, the successful development and/or\napproval of the applicable product candidate could be delayed significantly.\nIn addition, because of the sometimes-limited number of third parties who specialize in the development, manufacture and/or supply of our clinical and\npreclinical materials, we are often compelled to accept contractual terms that we deem less than desirable, including without limitation as pertains\nrepresentations and warranties, supply disruptions/failures, covenants and liability/indemnification. Especially as pertains liability and indemnification\nprovisions, because of the frequent disparities in negotiating leverage, we are often compelled to agree to low caps on counterparty liability and/or\nindemnification language that could result in outsized liability to us in situations where we have zero or relatively little culpability.\n79\nTable of Contents\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of products and product candidates.\nTo date, we have engaged primarily in intellectual property acquisitions, and evaluative and R&D activities and have not generated any revenues from\nproduct sales (except through Journey). We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of\napproximately $694.9 million. We may need to rely on third parties for activities critical to the product candidate development process, including but not\nnecessarily limited to:\n● identifying and evaluating product candidates;\n● negotiating, drafting and entering into licensing and other arrangements with product development partners; and\n● continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials.\nWe have also not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our development-stage\nproduct candidates, should any of them be approved for marketing. If we were to have any such product candidates approved, the successful\ncommercialization of such products would be dependent on us performing or contracting with third parties for performance, of a variety of critical\nfunctions, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● advising and participating in regulatory approval processes;\n● formulating and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and\n● conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical\ntrials of, product candidates, both at the Fortress level and via our subsidiaries and partner companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our\nstockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to develop and commercialize potential product candidates, as well as for you to assess the\nadvisability of investing in our securities.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed-upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required,\nour clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our\nproduct candidates when expected or at all.\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations and site management organizations to conduct most of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical\ntrials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, site management organizations,\nclinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical\ntrials. These CROs, investigators, and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our trials and the subsequent collection and\nanalysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will\ndevote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines or fails\nto adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of the\nclinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those\npatients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or\nconsultants to us from time to time and receive cash and/or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related\ncompensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, or the FDA’s\nwillingness to accept such data, may be jeopardized.\n80\nTable of Contents\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our\nresponsibilities or potential liability. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are\nconducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in\naccordance with GLPs as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical\ntrials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.\nRegulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our\nclinical research organizations fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA\nor comparable foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept such data, or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our\nmarketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our\nclinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP in strict conformity to\ncGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe also are required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database,\nClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter\ninto arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nSwitching or adding additional contract research organizations or site management organizations involves additional cost and requires management time\nand focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research organization or site management organization commences work. As\na result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships\nwith our contract research organizations or site management organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or\ndelays in the future.\nWe rely on clinical and pre-clinical data and results obtained from and by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we generally intend on developing product candidates with previously-validated mechanisms of action\nand seek to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical and pre-clinical data and other\nresults produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-party data and results we rely upon\nprove to be inaccurate, unreliable, not acceptable by regulatory authorities or not applicable to our product candidates or acquired products, we could make\ninaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our current or future product candidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and/or incur substantial business risk with no assurance\nof financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance on strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our existing product candidates and we may rely even\nmore on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and\ndrug development may be limited.\nIf we enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will, in part, depend on the performance of research\ncollaborators. We may not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates.\nResearch collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the\npreclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other\ndevelopment-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required\nmilestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or\nstop performance of those agreements.\n81\nTable of Contents\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of\ncollaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaboration proposals based upon their assessment of our financial,\nregulatory or intellectual property positions. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful\ndevelopment or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the\nrelated product revenues that might follow are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products.\nSuch collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on, and\nsuch collaborations could be more attractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n● significant time and effort from our management team;\n● coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n● effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nThe contractual provisions we may be forced to agree upon in services, manufacturing, supply and other agreements may be inordinately one-sided,\nvis-à-vis current or historical standard market terms (especially as pertains contractual liability and indemnification paradigms), and as a result we\nmay be subject to liabilities that are not attributable to our own actions or the actions of our personnel.\nThere is a finite number of service providers who can perform the services or produce the materials or product candidates that we need, and we therefore\noften have a limited number of options in choosing such service providers. The standard market terms in many of the agreements into which we\ncustomarily enter with such service providers are subject to evolution over time, often-times in favor of our counterparties. Also, some such agreements are\n“adhesion contracts” under which our contractual counterparties refuse to entertain any modifications to their template documentation. One area where\nservice providers often have and exert leverage over us is the negotiation of liability language – specifically in broadly scoped indemnification by us of\nservice providers and/or the application of liability damages “caps” to certain of such service providers’ indemnification obligations. In any circumstance\nwhere we’ve been compelled to agree to such language, it is conceivable that we will be liable to third parties for liabilities in excess of such caps that are\nattributable to the actions, forbearances and/or culpability of such service providers and their indemnitees (and not to those of us and our personnel).\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize\ntechnology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent\napplication process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining patents or what the\nscope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive product candidates\nand their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;\n● our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners do, and many of which have made significant\ninvestments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our abilities to make,\nuse, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent applications that we may have;\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both\ninside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns;\nand\n82\nTable of Contents\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign\ncompetitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or\notherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the PTO, or\nbecome involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights\nor the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would\nbe unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial,\nproceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our\ntechnologies or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without\ninfringing third-party patent rights.\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from\ncollaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent\nprotection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product\ncandidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making,\nusing and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or\ntechnologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of issued patents.\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and\ntheir trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third parties, and proprietary information\nand invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information\nindependently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’\nproprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a\nparty illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some\ncourts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were\nto be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they\ncommunicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent\napplications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and\ndevelopment output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-\nconsuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the\npatent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain\nor maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or more product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third\nparties may be able to leverage our proprietary information and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the\nmarket and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be\nrequired to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these\npatents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in\nrecent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or\nbiotechnology patents has emerged to date in the US. The patent situation outside the US is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not\nprotect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the US, and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European\npatent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than US law does. We might also become involved in derivation\nproceedings in the event that a third party misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more\ninventions. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party\nderived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope,\nvalidity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which\neffectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent\nlaws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of\nthe US have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino\nacid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their\ndetection.\nSuch subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with\nfew exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the US. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may\nbe allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or\ndefense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-\nSmith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include changes to transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a\n“first inventor-to-file” system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a less\nburdensome, quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. The PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern\nadministration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first\ninventor-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the\noperation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of\nour patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial\ncondition.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from\ncompeting with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by\ndeveloping similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved\nfor commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the\nspecific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of\nexclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing\nproducts that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect our business.\n84\nTable of Contents\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable\noutcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell\nproduct candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications,\nwhich are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the\nsubject matter of our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending\napplications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there\nmay be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we or our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature\noften lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first\nfiling, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in\npatents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In\nthe event that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates\nclaimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the US.\nThe costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a\nmaterial adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or any of our\nlicensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries\ngenerally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party’s intellectual property rights, we may\nhave to, among other things:\n● obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n● abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial funds, time and\nresources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;\n● pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary\ntechnology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;\n● pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or\n● defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of\nfinancial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and\nunsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our or our licensors’ patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which\ncan be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us\nalleging invalidity of our or our licensors’ patents or that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the PTO to institute inter partes\nreview against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement\nproceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor’s is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly\nor refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors’ patents do not cover the technology in question.\nAn adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or\ninterpreted narrowly and could likewise put pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery\nrequired in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure\nduring this type of litigation.\n85\nTable of Contents\nWe in-license from third parties a majority of the intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize products and product candidates. As such,\nany dispute with the licensors or non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the\napplicable product candidates.\nThe patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights underpinning the vast majority of our existing product candidates were in-licensed\nfrom third parties. Under the terms of such license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a\nmaterial breach. The licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product, and our ability to make\nthese payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable\nefforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our partners, on the one hand, and the respective licensing\npartner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a\nfailure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely\naffected.\nThe types of disputes that may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n● the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;\n● the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the licensors’ right\ntitle and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such agreements;\n● the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the rights and\nobligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense under such license agreement;\n● the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what activities or\nachievements satisfy those diligence obligations;\n● whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;\n● the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;\n● the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the\nsubject of such license agreements;\n● the calculation of royalty, milestone, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;\n● the extent to which rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;\n● whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is\nor can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;\n● disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent expenses;\n● intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to licensed intellectual\nproperty) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and\n● the priority of invention of patented technology.\n86\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in\nsuch agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which\nwould make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract\ninterpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or\nincrease what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair\nour ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize\nthe affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval but do not achieve broad market acceptance among\nphysicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates, if approved, generate from sales\nwill be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the\nmedical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, by third-party payors, including government payors, generally\nwould also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would depend on a number of factors,\nincluding, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n● the timing of market introduction of such products as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n● the potential and perceived advantages of such products over alternative treatments;\n● the safety of such products in a broader patient group (i.e., based on actual use);\n● the availability, cost and benefits of treatment, in relation to alternative treatments;\n● the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n● changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for such products;\n● the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug\ninteractions, or other precautions;\n● changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the\nmarketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n● relative convenience and ease of administration;\n● the prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;\n● the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n● unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\n87\nTable of Contents\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may\nnot generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical\ncommunity and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional\nlimitations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the desired labeling claims or scheduling classifications necessary or desirable for the promotion of our marketed products\n(or our product candidates if approved). We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies\nare not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval while our products are on the market, the FDA or a comparable regulatory\nauthority in another jurisdiction may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be\nexpensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be impacted or withdrawn and\nreformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any\nreformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one or more of our\nproduct candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and may have to limit their commercialization, if approved.\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products\nfor which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate or product\nwe develop, license, or acquire allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any\nsuch product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product\ncandidate or product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care\nproviders or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial\nliabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop, license or acquire;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● impairment of our business reputation;\n● costs of related litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n● loss of revenues;\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n● the ability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates.\n88\nTable of Contents\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us\nor may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and,\nin the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.\nWhen needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of\nour product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for\nmarketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful\nproduct liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could\ndecrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These\nindemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties\nif we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the authorized manufacturing facilities, processes and equipment, post-approval clinical\ndata, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing drug or biological\nproducts, as well as review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing\ninformation and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of\nrecords and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company\npresentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, the approval may be subject to limitations\non the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing\nand surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nWe also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of drug products. Later discovery of previously unknown\nproblems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n● restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;\n● restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n● warning letters, untitled letters, or Form 483s;\n● recalls or other withdrawal of the products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n● fines;\n● suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n● refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n● product seizure or detentions;\n● injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n● adverse publicity.\n89\nTable of Contents\nIf we or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing\nregulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may be subject to the actions listed above,\nincluding losing marketing approval for product candidates when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product\nsales or royalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the\nmarket value of our Securities to decline.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely\nimpact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until the relevant governmental authority has completed a rigorous and\nextensive regulatory review process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates in the U.S. will\nrequire approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the PTO. The FDA typically conducts a review\nof proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product\nbrand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be\nrequired to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we could lose the benefit of our existing\ntrademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product\nbrand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be\nunable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product\ncandidates.\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to\napplicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and\nregulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and\ndiminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly\napplicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False\nClaims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product\ncandidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and\nstate governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws\nand regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or\nproviding remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the\npurchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid;\n● federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and\ncivil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be\npresented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a\nfalse statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the federal Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit\nprogram or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective\nimplementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their\nbusiness associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with\nrespect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n90\nTable of Contents\n● the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is\navailable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to “covered recipients,” which\ninclude physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical\nnurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals) and applicable manufacturers. Applicable group\npurchasing organizations also are required to report annually to CMS the ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their\nimmediate family members. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act added to the definition of covered recipient practitioners including\nphysician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives effective in\n2022; and\n● analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing\narrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers;\nstate and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and\nthe relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare\nproviders; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to\nphysicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health\ninformation in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus\ncomplicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial\ncosts. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or\ncase law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or\nany other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without\nlimitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. If any of the physicians or other healthcare\nproviders or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be\nsubject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also\nmaterially affect our businesses.\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which could adversely affect our financial results,\nincluding without limitation the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding minority or non-control investment interests in a number of entities, we\nmay become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If we do become subject to\nthe Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and\ncompliance costs in the future.\nRecent U.S. Supreme Court decisions could create uncertainty in the life sciences space that could negatively impact our business.\nThree decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2024 may lead to an increase in litigation against regulatory agencies that could create uncertainty\nand thus negatively impact our business. The first decision overturned established precedent that required courts to defer to regulatory agencies’\ninterpretations of ambiguous statutory language. The second decision overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in administrative\nproceedings. The third decision extended the statute of limitations within which entities may challenge agency actions. These cases may result in increased\nlitigation by industry against regulatory agencies and impact how such agencies choose to pursue enforcement and compliance actions. However, the\nspecific, lasting effects of these decisions, which may vary within different judicial districts and circuits, is unknown. We also cannot predict the extent to\nwhich FDA and SEC regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and changes.\n91\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Other Risks\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business,\nwe collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary\nbusiness information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that\npreserves its confidentiality, availability and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have\naccess to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\nWe are in the process of implementing our internal security and business continuity measures and developing our information technology infrastructure.\nOur internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses\nand unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, third-party software,\ndata center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions,\nsystem malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or\nintentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties\n(including the deployment of harmful malware and other malicious code, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to\naffect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could compromise our system\ninfrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data or data that is\nprocessed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our\nbusiness operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, our partner company Journey was the\nvictim of a cybersecurity incident that affected its accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to\nfraudulent accounts. The details of the incident and its origin were investigated with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts working at the\ndirection of legal counsel. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not appear to have compromised any personally\nidentifiable information or protected health information. The federal government has been able to seize a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets\nassociated with the breach. Once the cryptocurrency has been converted back into U.S. dollars, Journey expects to receive a notification letter to initiate the\nreturn of the cash. This process could take as long as six months or more to complete. Fortress and Journey may incur additional expenses and losses as a\nresult of this cybersecurity incident, including those related to investigation fees and remediation costs.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory\napproval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug\ncandidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material\nadverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber\nintrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of\nattempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial\nespionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data,\nwhich could result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may\nnot be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may\nnot be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized\ncrime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\n92\nTable of Contents\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal\ninformation, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary\nbusiness information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more\neffectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action,\nor otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could\nresult in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions\nrelated to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with\nthese measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and\nprevent security incidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may\ncause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party\nexperts and consultants. We may face increased costs and find it necessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or\nperceived security breach.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the\npotential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our\nbusiness operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically\nreasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a\nsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party\nvendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third\nparties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent\nfuture events of this nature from occurring.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific, and technical personnel and consultants, and on our\nability to attract additional personnel as we continue to implement growth strategies and acquire and invest in companies with varied businesses. During\nour operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to\nimplement our growth strategy, the demands on our key employees will expand, and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees. The\ncompetition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel, or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill\ncritical positions, could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our partners. The loss or unavailability\nof the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we\nhave not obtained, do not own, and are not the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may\noccur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability to continue operations.\n93\nTable of Contents\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to\nnoncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and\npartners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could include intentional\nfailures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud\nand abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such\nemployees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the\nhealthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws\nand regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs\nand other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the\ncourse of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions\nwe take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental\ninvestigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted\nagainst us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and\nresults of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target\ncompanies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each\nof our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose\nsuch information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or\nequitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the\nunauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives –\nespecially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former\nemployers or other clients.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates, many of whom\nwere previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biopharmaceutical companies, including\nour competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used,\ndisclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be\nnecessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction\nto management and/or the employees or consultants that are implicated.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nThe stock prices of our securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, acquisition of potential new product candidates and companies and/or in-\nlicensing through multiple partners/affiliates;\n● sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n● issuance of debt or other securities;\n● our delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;\n● announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n94\nTable of Contents\n● developments concerning our licensors and/or product manufacturers;\n● litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n● conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n● governmental regulation and legislation;\n● unstable regional political and economic conditions;\n● variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n● change in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in\nparticular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market prices of our securities, regardless of our\nactual operating performance.\nSales or other issuances of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur, may\nadversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, are available for sale in the public market, either\npursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an effective registration statement. In addition, pursuant to our\ncurrent shelf registration statements on Form S-3, from time to time we may issue and sell shares of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock having\nan aggregate offering price of up to $50 million. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or our Series A Preferred Stock could\ncause a drop in the trading price of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\nWe will need to continue to expend capital on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or products could\nplace a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train, and manage more\nemployees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may\nrequire a disproportionate amount of our management’s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our\nbusiness.\nA catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or cause us to lose key data, which could cause us to curtail or cease\noperations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health epidemics and\npandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our businesses\ncould be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from\ndisasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of\nobtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial\ncondition and prospects.\nAny of the aforementioned circumstances, may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to provide services in-person and/or in a timely\nmanner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger effectiveness of “force majeure” clauses under\nagreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve developmental milestones on certain\ntimeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the enforceability of developmental milestones and\nrelated extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\n95\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage- point\ncumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use all of its pre-\nchange NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes\nin the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs\nand other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could\nharm our business.\nWe, and/or third parties on our behalf, may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to\nhuman health and safety or the environment. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations\ngovern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and\nregulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we\ncannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous\nwaste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines\narising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for\ndamages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of\nhazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental\nliability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current\nor future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may\nresult in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or\notherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business\nor the business of our partners.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability\nto hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the\nagency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development\nactivities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government\nagencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days\nbeginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough\nnonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to\ntimely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the timing of FDA’s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be delayed, which\ncould result in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\n96\nTable of Contents\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote\nsubstantial time to new compliance initiatives. Also, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future,\nour ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and,\nas a result, the value of our Securities.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), as well as rules subsequently\nimplemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring\nestablishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate corporate governance practices. Our management and other\npersonnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations\nmake it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits\nand coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain\nqualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. As a result,\nwe are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of\nthose controls, as required by Section 404 of SOX. These efforts to comply with Section 404 and related regulations have required, and continue to require,\nthe commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial\nreporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our\ncontrol systems in the future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory\nauthorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or\nchanges in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock or other Securities.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers and/or delaying or\npreventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a\npremium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that\nthey may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n● the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n● the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could\ninclude the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill,\nthat would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our\nBoard of Directors.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a\nperiod of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in\na prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of\nour Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your\nownership of our Securities through an acquisition.\n97\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange.\nWe have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of the Nasdaq, including rules requiring that the minimum trading price of our Common\nStock not close below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If we again are unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common\nStock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting\nof our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition\nor results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business\noperations and financial performance. For example, the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal\nto 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations\nthat would be imposed on such corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to newly enacted federal tax\nlegislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the\ndeductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could\nincrease our future U.S. tax expense.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the rate of return that we realize on the investment securities that we hold.\nWe customarily invest a significant portion of our cash in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) accounts, which bear interest\nincome to us that fluctuates according to adjustments in the target federal funds rate effected by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market\nCommittee (“FOMC”). The FOMC recently lowered the target federal funds rate and is anticipated by some to effect further decreases over the coming\nweeks and months, actions which have decreased, and could further decrease, the amount of interest income that we generate on our CDARS and on other\nshort-term cash equivalent investment securities that we may hold.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the\nCompany’s Series A Preferred Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue\nto accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash\ndividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash\nflow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should be lifted.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total\nundeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nItem 4.

If the Parties do not reach an agreement by\nthe conclusion of such 30-day period, then either Seller or Buyer may bring suit to resolve the Parties’ respective\nrights with respect to such Claim, and the applicable Governmental Authority shall determine the final amount of\nany Losses (if any) with respect to such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely deliver an Objection\nNotice, the Claims (and the amount of Losses related thereto) shall be deemed to be accepted by the Indemnifying\nParty. If such Claim is a result of a Third Party making a Claim against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying\nParty shall have the right (but not the obligation to) at its option and expense, assume the complete defense of such\nClaim, provided that (i) the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense of any such Claim at\nits own cost and expense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will conduct the defense of any such Claim with due regard\nfor the business interests and potential related liabilities of the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party\nwill not agree to any settlement that would admit liability on the part of the Indemnified Party or involve relief\nother than payment of money, without the approval of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld,\nconditioned or delayed; provided, that if it is reasonably likely that the Parties may have conflicting interests or if it\nis otherwise not advisable under applicable legal and ethical requirements for the Indemnifying Party’s defense\ncounsel to represent both Parties (as reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party), separate independent\ncounsel shall be retained for each Party at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such\nClaim, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any\nsettlement which does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the\nIndemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof. After notice to the Indemnified Party of the\nIndemnifying Party’s election to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the\nIndemnified Party for such legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection\nwith the defense thereof at the request of the Indemnifying Party. As to those Claims with respect to which the\nIndemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the\nIndemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such defense at the Indemnifying Party’s own cost and expense,\nand will not settle or otherwise dispose of any of the same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party; provided,\nthat, for the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Loss\nincurred in connection with a Claim in which the Indemnified Party controls the defense. The time limits set forth\nin Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 for making claims for indemnification are in lieu of, and the Parties expressly waive,\nany other applicable statute of limitations during which such claims may be brought or asserted. Any notice for\nindemnification made pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) prior to the expiration of the time limit set forth in Section 7.2\nor Section 7.3, as applicable, for the matter against which indemnity is sought shall for purposes of the time limits\nset forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as applicable, constitute a claim or demand brought within such time limit,\nand the obligations of the Indemnifying Party therefor under this Article 7 shall continue as to such matter,\nnotwithstanding the expiration, if any, of such time limit.\n7.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. Except in the case of matters relating to Fraud, all representations\nand warranties contained in this Agreement, any Transaction Document or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this\nAgreement will survive the Closing for a period of 12 months from the Closing\n32\nDate; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the respective representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in\nSection 5.1(a) (Organization), Section 5.1(b)(i) (Due Authorization; No Conflict), Section 5.1(d) (Brokers), Section 5.2(a)\n(Organization), Section 5.2(b)(i) (Due Authorization; No Conflict), Section 5.2(c)(i), (iii), (iv) (Acquired Assets) and Section 5.2(l)\n(Brokers) shall survive the Closing for a period ending upon the date that is 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of\nlimitations for each of the matters set forth therein; provided, further, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the\nrepresentations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 5.2(f) (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing for a period of 18 months\nfrom the Closing Date. Claims arising from, relating to or for Fraud shall survive the Closing indefinitely. The Parties further\nacknowledge that each of the survival periods in this Section 7.2 is the result of arm’s-length negotiation among the Parties and that\nthe Parties intend for such survival periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties.\n7.3 Limitations.\n(a) No Party will be liable to any other Party or any Indemnified Party for indemnification under Section 7.1(a)(i) or\nSection 7.1(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by such Party exceeds $25,000 (the\n“Deductible”), in which event, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible.\n(b) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Seller by Buyer Indemnitees\npursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), shall be an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Upfront Expense Reimbursement\nAmount and (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock of Buyer deemed as Clawback Shares (such sum, the\n“Seller Cap”).\n(c) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Buyer by the Seller\nIndemnitees pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i) shall be an amount equal to the Upfront Expense Reimbursement Amount\n(the “Buyer Cap”).\n(d) No Claim against Buyer and its Affiliates or Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(ii) or\nSection 7.1(b)(ii), as applicable, with respect to a breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement to be\nperformed after the Closing shall be brought or asserted after the date of expiration of the applicable statute(s) of\nlimitations applicable thereto.\n(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of the indemnification obligations of\nSeller under Section 7.1(b), the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 of this Agreement that are\nqualified as to materiality, in all material respects, material adverse effect or any similar qualification shall be\ndeemed to have been made without any such qualification for purposes of determining whether there has been a\nbreach of any representation and warranty and for purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a\nBuyer Indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder arising out of or resulting from such breach of a\nrepresentation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.\n(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 7 to the contrary, in the event of any breach of a representation or warranty\nin this Agreement or any other Transaction Document that results from Fraud by or on behalf of any Person then, (i)\nsuch representation or warranty will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of\nthe transactions contemplated hereby indefinitely, notwithstanding that such survival might otherwise be limited by\nthe applicable survival date, (ii) any limitations on Losses set forth in this Article 7 shall not apply to any Loss that\nBuyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, may suffer, incur, sustain or become subject to, as a\nresult of, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any such breach, and (iii) none of such Losses shall be\nlimited or restricted by the Seller Cap or Buyer Cap, as applicable.\n33\n(g) Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause their respective Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable\nsteps to mitigate Losses to the extent required by Law upon and after becoming aware of any event which would\nreasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses, including without limitation pursuing recoveries against Third\nParties, except that such Indemnified Party shall not be required to commence litigation against any insurer or Third\nParty. The reasonable costs and expenses of mitigation hereunder shall constitute indemnifiable Losses under this\nAgreement.\n(h) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, speculative, loss\nof profits, special, indirect or punitive damages (except for amounts actually paid or payable to a Third Party by an\nIndemnified Party).\n(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by an\nIndemnified Party shall be calculated after giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually received by such\nIndemnified Party with respect to such Losses, less any related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of\npursuing any related insurance claims and related increases in insurance premiums or other chargebacks. If any\ninsurance proceeds are received by any Indemnified Parties with respect to any Losses after Seller or Buyer (as\napplicable) has made a payment to such Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, the Indemnified Parties shall\npromptly pay to Seller or Buyer (as applicable) the sum of the amount of such proceeds up to the amount of the\npayment to the Indemnified Party’s less any of the Indemnified Party’s related costs and expenses of recovering\nsuch insurance proceeds, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any related insurance claims and related\nincreases in insurance premiums or other chargebacks.\n7.4 Timing and Order of Payment.

In the event\nany Buyer Indemnitee shall suffer any Losses for which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article 7,\nsuch Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(b), to recover such Losses (a) first, at\nBuyer’s option, from Seller, in cash in immediately available funds up to the Upfront Expense Reimbursement Amount and (b)\nthereafter, to the extent such Losses exceed the Upfront Expense Reimbursement Amount, in accordance with Section 7.5.\n7.5 Clawback Shares.\n(a) In the event any Buyer Indemnitee shall suffer any Losses that are finally determined pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and\n7.4 for which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article 7, and such Losses exceed the\nUpfront Expense Reimbursement Amount or Buyer determines to not recover from the Upfront Expense\nReimbursement Amount, then Seller shall surrender and forfeit the number of Clawback Shares equal in value\n(determined in accordance with Section 7.5(b)) to the Losses suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such\nClaim (less any applicable recovery by Buyer from the Upfront Expense Reimbursement Amount in accordance\nwith Section 7.4) (each such instance, a “Share Clawback”). In the event of a Share Clawback, the number of\nshares constituting Clawback Shares for purposes of such Share Clawback shall be surrendered and forfeited by\nSeller to Buyer or its designee, and Buyer shall have the right to affirmatively cancel such Clawback Shares with no\nfurther action required by Seller, for no consideration (it being acknowledged and agreed that such Clawback\nShares are being delivered in satisfaction of Seller’s obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees). For the\navoidance of doubt,\n34\nfollowing a Share Clawback, the number of shares constituting Clawback Shares shall be reduced by the number of\nshares surrendered and forfeited pursuant to such Share Clawback.\n(b) For purposes of determining the number of Clawback Shares to be surrendered and forfeited pursuant to a Share\nClawback, each Clawback Share shall be ascribed a value per share equal to the then-current independent valuation\nof the Common Stock of Buyer on the date on which the applicable indemnification Claim (and Losses related\nthereto) is finally determined pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and 7.4.\n(c) On the Clawback Expiration Date, subject to Section 7.5(f) in respect of any Pending Claim, any remaining shares\nof Common Stock of Buyer constituting Clawback Shares shall no longer constitute Clawback Shares and shall no\nlonger be subject to this Section 7.5.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if no Share Clawback occurs prior to the Clawback Expiration\nDate, subject to Section 7.5(f) in respect of any Pending Claim, the Clawback Shares shall remain the sole property\nof the Seller.\n(e) Until the Clawback Expiration Date, Seller agrees that it will hold and will not, directly or indirectly, without the\nBuyer’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), sell, transfer\nor otherwise dispose of any Clawback Shares, or otherwise make any short sale of, grant any option for the\npurchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale of the\nClawback Shares (any such transaction, a “Transfer”); provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) Seller\nfrom Transferring any Clawback Shares to Buyer or its Affiliates; (ii) the disposition or other Transfer of Clawback\nShares pursuant to (A) any merger, consolidation or similar transaction to which Buyer is a constituent corporation\nor (B) a bona fide tender offer or exchange offer made to all of the holders of Common Stock of Buyer by a Third\nParty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 7.5(f) in respect of any Pending Claim, the transfer\nrestrictions and the Share Clawback right shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect on the\nClawback Expiration Date.\n(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Claim pursuant to this Article 7 shall have been properly\nasserted by any Buyer Indemnitee in accordance with Section 7.1 and prior to the Clawback Expiration Date, and\nsuch Claim(s) remains pending as of the Clawback Expiration Date (any such Claim(s), a “Pending Claim”), then\nSeller agrees that a number of Clawback Shares equal in value (in accordance with Section 7.5(b)) to Buyer’s\nBoard of Directors good faith determination of the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim shall remain subject to\nShare Clawback until the resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim in accordance with\nSection 7.1(c) and 7.4.\n(g) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Article 7 are an integral part of the\ntransactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and that, without these\nagreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. In particular,\neach Party acknowledges and agrees that the Share Clawback is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable mechanism to\ncompensate the Buyer Indemnitees in the event such Buyer Indemnitees have suffered Losses in excess of the\nUpfront Expense Reimbursement Amount prior to the Clawback Expiration Date.\n(h) In the event Buyer undergoes any share split, combination, reclassification, bonus issue of shares or similar\ncapitalization change with respect to shares of Common Stock of Buyer prior to the Clawback Expiration Date,\nappropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the shares of Common Stock of Buyer comprising the\nClawback Shares.\n35\n7.6 Sole Remedy. Except in the case of matters relating to Fraud, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive\nremedy of any Indemnified Party for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating\nto this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby is set forth in this Article 7; provided, however, that notwithstanding\nthe foregoing: (a) the Parties shall be entitled to enforce the right to specific performance as set forth in Section 9.9, and (b) the\nparties to the Transaction Documents shall be entitled to enforce the terms of each of the Transaction Documents (as applicable),\nand for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.6 shall not apply to the Transaction Documents other than this Agreement.\n8.

For avoidance of doubt,\nit would be commercially reasonable for Crystalys to terminate the Fuji License Agreement if it is not developing,\nmanufacturing or commercializing the Purchased Product.\n11\n(c) In the event that Crystalys licenses or sublicenses the Purchase Product, Crystalys shall cause the license with such licensee\nor sub-licensee to include a net sales or similar concept provision that is calculated substantially in accordance with Net\nSales.\n5.2 Royalty.\n(a) Royalty Payments. From and after the First Commercial Sale Date, within seventy-five (75) days after the end of each\nFiscal Quarter during the Royalty Term, on a Purchased Product-by-Purchased Product and country-by-country basis,\nCrystalys shall pay to Urica, without any setoff or offset (subject, in each case, to Section 5.7 (Certain Tax Matters)), the\nRoyalty Payment due from the Net Sales of all Purchased Products in all countries in the Territory for that Fiscal Quarter. All\nsuch amounts will be deposited by Crystalys into a deposit account (the “Specified Account”) that is subject to a “springing\ncontrol” deposit account control agreement (“DACA”).\n(b) Reports. Within seventy-five (75) days after the end of each Fiscal Quarter during the Term, Crystalys shall provide Urica\nwith a report for the Fiscal Quarter setting forth the Net Sales of the Purchased Product in the applicable Fiscal Quarter on a\nPurchased Product-by-Purchased Product and country-by-country basis, along with Crystalys’s calculation of the Royalty\nPayments due to Urica during such Fiscal Quarter (the “Quarterly Report”). Crystalys shall keep accurate records in\nsufficient detail to enable to determination of any payment payable under this Agreement. The Quarterly Report shall\ninclude, at minimum, the same level of detail and information as provided to Fuji pursuant to the Fuji License Agreement.\n(c) Currency. All Royalty Payments shall be paid in U.S. Dollars via electronic funds transfer or wire transfer of immediately\navailable funds to such bank account as the other party shall designate in writing prior to the date of such payment. For sales\noutside of the United States, the rate of exchange to be used in computing the monthly amount of currency equivalent in U.S.\nDollars will be made at the monthly rate of exchange utilized by Crystalys in its worldwide accounting system. If, due to\nprohibitions imposed by national or international authorities, payments cannot be made as provided in this Section 5.2\n(Royalty), the Parties shall consult with each other to determine a prompt and acceptable solution.\n(d) Late Payment. A late fee of one percent (1%) over the Prime Rate (calculated on a per annum basis) will accrue on all\nunpaid amounts with respect to any Royalty Payment from the date such obligation was due.

During the Royalty Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Urica shall have the right, upon prior\nwritten notice to Crystalys, not more than once in any Fiscal Year, to audit the books and records of Crystalys through an\nindependent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by Urica and reasonably acceptable\nto Crystalys. The independent certified public accountant shall execute a confidentiality agreement, in a form reasonably\nacceptable to Crystalys, with respect to all information provided by Crystalys. Crystalys shall grant the independent ceritifed\npublic accountant access during normal business hours to the books and records of Crystalys concerning the Purchased\nProducts as may be reasonably necessary for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the reports required to be\nfurnished by Crystalys pursuant to Sections 5.2(b); provided, however, that verification shall not include records for more\nthan the preceding three (3) years. The records and results of the auditors shall be deemed Confidential Information of\nCrystalys and Urica. A copy of the independent certified public accountant’s report shall be delivered to Crystalys\nsimultaneously with its delivery to Urica. If the independent certified public accountant’s report correctly shows any\nunderpayment of royalties by\n12\nCrystalys, Crystalys shall remit to Urica within thirty (30) days after Crystalys’ receipt of such report: (i) the amount of the\nunderpayment; (ii) interest on the underpayment that shall be calculated pursuant to Section 5.2(d); and (iii) the reasonable\nfees and expenses of the independent certified public accountant performing the audit if and only if the underpayment\nexceeds the greater of five percent (5%) or Fifty Thousand U.S. dollars ($50,000) of the total Royalty Payment owed for the\nFiscal Year then being reviewed. Otherwise, Urica’s accountant fees and expenses will be borne by Urica. If the independent\ncertified public accountant’s report correctly shows any overpayment of royalties by Crystalys, Urica shall remit to Crystalys\nwithin thirty (30) days after Urica’ receipt of such report the amount of the overpayment. In the event that an independent\ncertified public accountant appointed by Fuji delivers a report to Crystalys showing any underpayment of royalties by\nCrystalys to Fuji pursuant to Section 9-4 of the Fuji License Agreement, Crystalys shall promptly, but within five (5)\nBusiness Days of receiving a copy of such report, provide written notice to Urica that Crystalys is in receipt of such report,\nand following receipt of such notice, Urica may invoke its audit rights pursuant to this Section 5.2(e). Notwithstanding\nanything in this Agreement to the contrary, Crystalys shall keep, or cause to be kept, records of the sales of the Purchased\nProducts under this Agreement for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of each Fiscal Year. Upon reasonable\nrequest by Urica, Crystalys shall supply Urica with those records, which may be submitted to an applicable tax authority, and\nCrystalys shall give Urica commercially reasonable assistance in relation thereto.\n5.3 Change of Control and Divestitures. In the event of (a) a Change of Control of Crystalys, or (b) a sale, assignment,\nexclusively license, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition by Crystalys to another Person of all or any part of the Collateral\n(including, without limitation, the Acquired Assets (as defined in the APA) that are primarily related to the Compound or the Purchased\nProduct) (such Collateral or portion thereof, the “Transferred Assets”, such Change of Control or other transaction, a “Divestiture” and the\nparty receiving such Transferred Assets or the acquiror(s) in such Change of Control, the “Transferee”), Crystalys shall (i) provide Urica at\nleast thirty (30) days prior written notice of each and every proposed Divestiture, (ii) prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation\nof each and every Divestiture, cause each applicable Transferee to acknowledge and expressly agree in writing with, inter alios, Urica (in\nforms substantially similar to this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agreement) to assume the same obligations that\nCrystalys, its Affiliates and its permitted successors and assigns have under this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security\nAgreement, including (without limitation) those obligations with respect to the payment of the Royalty Payments pursuant to Section 5.2,\nand such obligations under this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agreement shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such\nTransferee, and (iii) prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of each and every Divestiture, cause all secured creditors of each\napplicable Transferee that would have a Lien on any of the Transferred Assets to expressly agree in writing with, inter alios, Urica (in form\nsubstantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement) to assume the same obligations of a Permitted Senior Lender under the Intercreditor\nAgreement, which obligations shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such secured creditor(s). For the avoidance of doubt, after any such\nDivestiture conducted in compliance with the foregoing in this Section 5.3, Crystalys shall no longer be liable to Urica for the Royalty\nPayments and its other obligations under this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agreement.\n5.4 Disclosures. Neither Party shall, and each Party hereto shall cause its respective Representatives, Affiliates and Affiliates’\nRepresentatives not to, issue a press release or other public announcement or otherwise make any public disclosure with respect to this\nAgreement, or the subject matter hereof, without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law, the UCC or stock exchange rule (in which case the party hereto required\nto make the press release or other public announcement or disclosure shall allow the other party hereto reasonable time to comment on, and,\nif applicable, reasonably request the disclosing party to seek to the extent available confidential\n13\ntreatment in respect of portions of, such press release or other public announcement or disclosure in advance of such issuance).\n5.5 Efforts to Consummate Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Crystalys and Urica\nshall use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all\nthings reasonably necessary under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Security\nAgreement. Each of Urica and Crystalys agrees to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and\nto take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated\nby this Agreement and the Security Agreement.\n5.6 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, Crystalys and Urica agree to execute and deliver such other documents,\ncertificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary in order to give effect to the\ntransactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Security Agreement.\n5.7 Certain Tax Matters.\n(a) The Parties agree that for tax purposes, the Royalty Payments from Crystalys to Urica pursuant to Section 5.2 (Royalty) shall\nbe treated under current law as deferred contingent consideration for the sale of the Acquired Assets by Urica to Crystalys\neligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or\nlocal law, as appropriate. Each Party agrees not to take any position that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section\n5.7(a) on any tax return or in any audit or other tax-related administrative or judicial proceeding unless the other Party has\nconsented in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such actions or as otherwise\nrequired by a change in Law after the Effective Date or a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the\nCode. If there is an inquiry by any Governmental Authority of a Party related to the treatment described in this Section\n5.7(a), the Parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate with each other in responding to such inquiry in a reasonable manner\nwhich is consistent with this Section 5.7(a).\n(b) Crystalys shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any payment to Urica or any Affiliate of Urica pursuant to this\nAgreement such amounts as Crystalys is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code, or any applicable Law,\nwith respect to the making of such payment; provided, that Crystalys shall notify Urica at least five (5) Business Days prior\nto deducting and withholding from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, which notice shall include\nthe authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, and shall use commercially\nreasonable efforts to cooperate with Urica to reduce or eliminate any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that such\namounts are so deducted or withheld and, if applicable, paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, and subject to\nSection 5.7(d), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect\nof whom such deduction or withholding was made.\n(c) Subject to Section 5.7(d), each Party shall be responsible for all taxes imposed on such Party relating to the transactions and\nany amounts paid to such Party in connection with this Agreement. The Parties agree that all amounts payable under Section\n5.2 (Royalty) are exclusive of all applicable federal, national, state and local sales and use taxes, value added taxes, goods\nand services taxes, excise taxes or similar taxes imposed with respect to such payments (such taxes, “Indirect Taxes”),\nwhich shall be the responsibility of Crystalys. For the avoidance of doubt, such Indirect Taxes shall not include any income\ntaxes. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in accordance with applicable Law to minimize any Indirect Taxes incurred in\nconnection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n14\n(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any Party, Transferee or licensee or sub-licensee of\nsuch Party takes any Tax Action without the other Party’s prior written consent and, as a result thereof, the amount of taxes\nrequired to be deducted or withheld in respect of a payment to the other Party (the “Non-Acting Party” and such taxes,\n“Withholding Taxes”) is greater than the amount of Withholding Taxes that would have been required to be withheld absent\nsuch Tax Action, then the amount payable to the Non-Acting Party shall be adjusted to take into account such additional\nWithholding Taxes as necessary so that, after making all required withholdings, the Non-Acting Party receives an amount\nequal to the sum it would have received had no such Tax Action been taken. The obligation to adjust payments pursuant to\nthe preceding sentence shall not apply, however, to the extent such increased Withholding Tax would not have been imposed\nbut for a Tax Action taken by the Non-Acting Party pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n6.

For such forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our resubmission of our Biologics License Application\n(“BLA”) for cosibelimab, our belief that the BLA resubmission addresses all the issues in the complete response letter (“CRL”), our belief about the comprehensive nature of\nour BLA resubmission and expectations regarding a decision by the FDA on our BLA, our reaching alignment with the FDA on our cosibelimab BLA resubmission strategy, our\nability to work with our third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) and the FDA to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL and execute on a pathway\nforward for the potential marketing approval of cosibelimab, the adequacy of the responses to the inspection issues submitted to FDA by our third-party CMO, our projections\nof regulatory review timelines, the commercial potential of cosibelimab, if approved, the potential differentiation of cosibelimab, including a potentially favorable safety profile\nas compared to the currently available anti-PD-1 therapies and the two-fold mechanism of action of cosibelimab translating into potential enhanced efficacy, our growth\nstrategy, products and product development programs and any other statements that are not descriptions of fact. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s\ncurrent expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. Factors that\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with the regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the\ntimeline of FDA review of the resubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory solution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at\nall during the review process for the BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information sufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our\nability and our third party CMO to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL; any facility inspection or re-inspection regarding our third party CMO or otherwise; whether\nthe FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA resubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a partnering\nrelationship for commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved, on acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with\napplicable regulations; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from\nthe topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will be observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and\nanalyzed; the risk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an\napplication for approval of cosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results from the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory\napproval of cosibelimab to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to our\nchemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic\nagreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-\nparty suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the\nmilestones we project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones.
