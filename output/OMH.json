our[Telegram](https://t.me/ohmyhomesg) channel and follow our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ohmyhomesg) page for the latest property updates.**\n\nAt CNA’s Leadership Summit 2023 – Trust Matters, Ohmyhome CEO Rhonda Wong joined the panel ‘Building Trust With Your Customers’ alongside fellow panellists Paul Burton, General Manager, IBM Asia Pacific, and Christopher Ong, Managing Director, DHL Express Singapore, to explore how business leaders can build, restore, and retain trust with customers in an ever-polarising world.\n\nTrust is essential for any business to succeed, but more so in the property industry. As Rhonda shared with CNA’s Elizabeth Neo in [this interview](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/power-knowledge-equity-extremely-important-driving-customer-trust-ohmyhome-ceo-3660566) before her panel, Ohmyhome has consistently had the privilege of engaging with customers who, while initially cautious about the property transaction process, have come to place their trust in our property agents and the Ohmyhome team. This transformation is often a result of our commitment to delivering exceptional service and positive experiences, which has helped us build strong, lasting relationships with our valued clients.\n\n![](https://ohmyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ohmyhome-CEO-Rhonda-Wong-on-Building-Trust-With-Customers-Through-Knowledge-Equity.png)_Ohmyhome was built on the foundation of placing customers first_.\n\n## Cultivating Trust: Our Journey to Becoming the Most Comprehensive Property Solution for Everyone\n\nOhmyhome was built on the foundation of placing customers first and winning their trust by providing access to transparent and accurate information that they need throughout their housing journey.\n\nHaving grown up in a migrant family in Singapore, Rhonda and co-founder Race Wong have an intimate understanding of the importance of housing as a lifelong asset and the [utmost level of service that property agents need to provide](https://ohmyhome.com/en-sg/blog/how-ohmyhome-recruits-the-best-property-agents-in-singapore/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"utmost level of service that property agents need to provide\"). “That’s why we firmly believe in the power of knowledge equity,” Rhonda shared. \n\nWith our next-generation [Home Ownership Management & e-Valuation tool](https://ohmyhome.com/en-sg/homer/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"Home Ownership Management & e-Valuation tool\"), or Homer AI, we provide customers with real-time information on their home valuation, the most recent transactions in their area, as well as their cash proceeds (for sellers) and affordability (for buyers), so that consumers can have access to the most accurate information at their fingertips, round the clock, allowing them to make the best decisions for one of the most important assets in their life. \n\nAs the saying goes, “Knowledge is power, but knowledge shared is trust multiplied.”\n\n## Leverage the power of technology \n\nEarly this year, the property industry was caught in a [resurgence of rental scams by property agent impersonators](https://ohmyhome.com/en-sg/blog/how-to-spot-property-agent-impersonation-scams/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"resurgence of rental scams by property agent impersonators\") asking customers for rental deposits from non-bona fide listings. This has caused thousands of victims to lose close to $4 million. \n\n![](https://ohmyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Singpass-verification-featured-image-600-×-600-px-2-1024x536.png)![](https://ohmyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Infographics_Singpass-1024x553.png)\n\nAs a property technology platform with thousands of users, we immediately put in place safety measures to ensure these scams don’t spread on the Ohmyhome app. We quickly implemented a [digital identity verification system via Singpass](https://ohmyhome.com/en-sg/blog/ohmyhome-first-property-platform-solution-in-singapore-to-pioneer-property-ownership-verification-with-singpass/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"digital identity verification system via Singpass\") for homeowners to verify that the property they are listing belongs to them.\n\nAs a result, all property listings on Ohmyhome today are 100% verified, with no duplicates. So property transactors [looking to buy or rent a home](https://ohmyhome.com/download-app/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"looking to buy or rent a home\") can be confident they are talking to the real owner of the property they’re interested in. \n\n## We can deliver and we deliver well\n\nThe aforementioned values and the measures we took have propelled us to be the most highly rated property transaction platform in the region, with a 4.9-star average rating on both Google and Facebook, according to over 8,000 happy customers.\n\n![](https://ohmyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RIK_5438-1024x683.jpg)_The CNA Leadership Summit 2023 – Trust Matters on ‘Building Trust With Your Customers’ with (From left) Paul Burton, General Manager, IBM Asia Pacific, Christopher Ong, Managing Director, DHL Express Singapore, Rhonda Wong, Founder & CEO of Ohmyhome._\n\nAlso on the panel with Rhonda were Paul Burton, GM of IBM APAC, who highlighted the importance of transparent and fair AI solutions to build trust, and Christopher Ong, MD of DHL Singapore, who reiterated DHL’s commitment to reliability, which is key to establishing trust with customers.\n\nThe CNA Leadership Summit was also graced by inspiring individuals from various industries:\n\nEdwin Tong, Singapore’s Minister for Culture, highlighted the Ethnic Integration Policy’s role in promoting racial harmony in Singapore by ensuring a balanced population mix and addressing housing issues – something Ohmyhome’s agents have been helping with as well.\n\nLee Hui Li, Microsoft Singapore’s Managing Director, emphasized the importance of organizational culture to drive trust, where employees act as brand ambassadors promoting empathy and doing good to make a genuine difference. \n\nAs the CEO of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre, Tony Soh stressed the significance of starting from purpose: and aligning it with vision, mission, and strategy to foster trust within the organization.\n\nPearlyn Phau, Group CEO of Singlife, emphasised that leaders must lead by example to build trust and encourage collaboration. \n\nNicholas Lee, CEO of Ez Link, underlined the necessity of open and honest communication: creating a safe space for innovation, and the higher cost of lacking trust compared to investing in trust-building. \n\nYou can watch the replay of CNA’s Leadership Summit 2023 – Trust Matters on[ this website](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-leadership-summit-trust-matters).\n\nWe hope that by bringing attention to these key approaches by all the top businesses in Singapore, and even the government, other organisations will join the conversation on trust and continuously take steps to be trustworthy in all aspects of the word — not just in the products or services provided, but in that real, “sticky way”, as moderator Jill Neubroner said on the second panel, that customers can hold on to in times of crises. \n\nFind out more about Ohmyhome’s services [here](https://ohmyhome.com/en-sg/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=rhonda_leadership_summit_recap \"here\").

There are many roles that we play, and we have to be comfortable and aware of the path that we have chosen. Time is the most precious commodity that equalises everyone, no one has more or less each day.\n\nTherefore, how we choose to spend time has to be intentional. I check my calendar regularly, especially before the start of the week or day. When that decision is made, staying focused is key, whether at work, with children or in any other roles, so that we are fully present during the times we have chosen to be present.\n\nI miss my kids too but to be quite honest, when I am fully focused at work, I don't actually have the time to think of my kids. When work is meaningful, exciting and often full of challenges, it consumes me during those hours. But once it's time for kids, they have me 100 per cent. Same for my parents, husband and anyone I choose to spend time with.\"\n\n## Rachel Lim, co-founder of clothing line Love, Bonito\n\n![Rachel Lim, co-founder of Love, Bonito with her son.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5OfAfq3wWdsuYPfg_7sL6g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0NDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ee2b2900-f096-11ed-bfdf-983d88514dc1)\n\nRachel Lim, co-founder of Love, Bonito with her son.

(PHOTO: Perky Lash) · Perky Lash\n\n\"I think it is really important to learn to draw the line between your personal life and work. We need to really stop working when we are back at home to fulfil other roles as a wife and mother.\n\nStory continues\n\nI used to say this a lot to my kids, \"Mummy is working, please wait a while\" in the early days of my business. One day, my kids were playing – they love to act and imitate the adults – and they said \"Mummy always say, \"wait, wait, wait\".\n\nThat struck me at that moment, and I realised how guilty I felt to keep rejecting them. It could be just something that happened in school that they wanted to share with me or spend time together, but I did not fulfil that.\n\nNow, I make sure that I am off work by 9pm when the shop closes, then rush home to accompany them for bedtime at 10pm. We will read storybooks and share what happened during the day. This is our we-time together, and I treasure it a lot.\n\nThrough my years of building my career, I have also learnt to trust and delegate tasks to my team. This way, it helps reduce stress so I can focus on doing what I do best and manage my workload more effectively. With a happier mood, I can enjoy my time with my family and children better.\"\n\n## Viveka Kalidasan, founder of semiconductor startup accelerator Let-Lab Singapore\n\n![Viveka Kalidasan, founder of Let-Lab Singapore.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a7I6SyQB6uTUXH9epD3MHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTcwNTtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/13c4a6e0-f09d-11ed-b0ff-a6fcc089f5ef)\n\nViveka Kalidasan, founder of Let-Lab Singapore. (PHOTO: Let-Lab Singapore) · Let-Lab Singapore\n\n\"I believe in work-life balance. When people talk about prioritising, I talk about meticulous planning. Building a startup accelerator from scratch, through pregnancy and maternity, in a hyper male-dominated industry 4.0 manufacturing space, as a solo woman, was a challenge I took on with utmost pleasure.\n\nI plan my day very well, to cater to my baby's needs and my job's needs. I have a family that supports me through thick and thin. I ensure the ecosystem supports me. If there is no support, I create it, so as to deliver my best. Passion and planning are what I vouch for.\"\n\n## Pamela Lim, co-founder of hair spa TwoHerbs\n\n![Pamela Lim, co-founder of TwoHerbs, with her husband and children.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hMni8BbxIRGWFp3vhMCCfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/60ea4be0-f09e-11ed-bdda-0597fdc0004a)\n\nPamela Lim, co-founder of TwoHerbs, with her husband and children. (PHOTO: TwoHerbs) · Two Herbs\n\n\"There is no perfect formula to balance work and family, especially with schooling children. We can only try to be in equilibrium every day.\n\nOne thing that I do is that I cut off work and (the use of the) phone totally to give my kids 100 per cent attention – even for a short 30 minutes to a couple of hours – every day.\n\nThat's when I really look at their faces, talk to them, listen to them and really do what they are doing. I will make my presence felt during these precious moments.\"\n\n**Follow us on**[**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/YahooSingapore/)**,**[**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/yahoosg/)**,**[**TikTok**](https://www.tiktok.com/@yahoosea)**and**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/YahooSG/)**.**\n\n[![Yahoo Singapore Telegram](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tp94Qzcoc_H.eAX0olCLWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/b57b8800-116e-11ed-b76b-fc29cd7fd6ec)](http://t.me/YahooSingapore?ncid=other_sgtelegram_sv1j4gq38dc)\n\nYahoo Singapore Telegram \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-SG)\n\nand \n\n[Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-SG)\n\n[Privacy dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-SG)\n\n## Recommended stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"
