(“Inspired” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: INSE), a leading B2B provider of gaming content, technology, hardware and services, today reported financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified business model and our ability to successfully execute across our business segments,” said Lorne Weil, Executive Chairman of Inspired. “Interactive continues to be a standout performer with revenue growing 40% year-over-year and EBITDA increasing 47%, driven by strong growth across key markets including the UK, North America, and mainland Europe. The segment's EBITDA margin expanded to 67.6%, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our digital business model. We're particularly encouraged by the substantial progress we’ve made in our Hybrid Dealer rollout strategy, successfully launching our MGM Bonus City game with BetMGM in Michigan and achieving a significant milestone with the commitment to our revolutionary Hybrid Dealer Roulette game in Canada by Loto-Québec. Moreover, our strategic partnership with FanDuel to integrate our Hybrid Dealer suite and develop content that is proprietary to FanDuel represents another major step forward in our North American expansion strategy.\n\n“In our Gaming segment, we’re seeing positive momentum from our operational initiatives, with EBITDA increasing 29% year-over-year despite more modest revenue growth, due to an improvement in our revenue mix for the quarter. We continue to execute on the opportunities before us in our Gaming segment, as exemplified by our major contract with Mecca Bingo to supply 170 state-of-the-art gaming machines through a five-year agreement. This follows our previously announced William Hill partnership, where we're proceeding with plans to deploy 5,000 new Vantage cabinets, the installation of which has begun and will be complete by the end of the first quarter, setting a foundation for growth in 2025 as these next-gen terminals have proven to drive consistent double-digit growth.\n\n“While Virtual Sports faced continued headwinds from a key customer, we’re seeing encouraging trends in the broader business with high single-digit revenue growth in the rest of the customer base driven by online performance. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain confident in the long-term growth trajectory of this high-margin business. The business continues to generate industry-leading margins of nearly 79% as we invest in strategic growth initiatives, particularly in Brazil, where we’re dedicating resources to capitalize on this significant market opportunity. We’re particularly excited about our new licensing agreement with the National Hockey League, which enhances our growing portfolio of major sports partnerships alongside the NFL and NBA. This agreement allows us to develop innovative interactive Virtual Sports games featuring NHL branding, further strengthening our offering in the North American and European markets.\n\n“In our Leisure segment, we delivered 5% revenue growth and a meaningful improvement in EBITDA margin to 30.6%. Our holiday park business showed steady growth with new site additions contributing to performance.\n\n“Lastly, we are thrilled to welcome James Richardson to the Inspired Entertainment team. James’s extensive background in financial management and his proven track record of driving growth and operational excellence make him an ideal fit for our company as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives and deliver value to our shareholders.\n\n“Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities: expanding our digital businesses, optimizing our land-based operations, and investing in new market opportunities. The strong performance of Interactive, improving profitability in Gaming, and our ongoing investments in Virtual Sports content and new markets give us confidence in our ability to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a licensing agreement with the National Hockey League (“NHL”) granting Inspired rights to develop interactive, fixed odds Virtual Sports games, featuring the NHL logo and NHL Club jerseys and names.\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced revolutionary Hybrid Dealer Roulette game in Canada with Loto-Québec that is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a long-term extension of its Virtual Sports partnership with OPAP, Greece’s leading gaming company, and will upgrade 4,000 Video Lottery Terminals (“VLTs”).\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a strategic partnership with FanDuel to integrate Inspired’s innovative Hybrid Dealer suite of content and develop a bespoke game tailored specifically for FanDuel’s audience.\n\n**Summary of Third Quarter 2024 Segment Financial Results**** _(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Reported Variance**| **Currency Movement 2024****2**| **Functional Currency Variance**  \n**(In $ millions)**| **2024**| **2023**| **%**| **$**| **%**  \n**_Total Revenue_**  \nGaming (excl.

We use these financial measures to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We believe that these measures are also commonly used in our industry to measure performance. For these reasons, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide expanded insight into our business, in addition to standard U.S. GAAP financial measures. There are no uniform rules for defining and using non-GAAP financial measures, and as a result the measures we use may not be comparable to measures used by other companies, even if they have similar labels. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP financial statements.\n\nWe define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\n\n**_EBITDA_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense, and other additional exclusions and adjustments (see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table)_._ Such additional excluded amounts include stock-based compensation U.S. GAAP charges where the associated liability is expected to be settled in stock, and changes in the value of earnout liabilities and income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where trading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the normal course of business, including (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2) merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a particularly useful performance measure, because it focuses on certain operating drivers of the business, including sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can provide a more complete understanding of our operating results and the trends to which we are subject, and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss, because it does not take into account certain aspects of our operating performance (for example, it excludes non-recurring gains and losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of underlying business activities)_._ Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the use by other companies of similarly termed measures. Management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several measures for evaluating our operating performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which affect depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income tax benefit (expense), are evaluated separately by management.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding the effects of certain exclusions and adjustments. Such excluded amounts include income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where trading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the normal course of business, including (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2) merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business. These items have been adjusted to reflect the tax impact from excluding them from net income (loss).\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income per diluted share_** is computed by dividing the Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including the effects of any potentially dilutive securities, including RSUs, using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method, unless the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n\n**_Functional Currency at Constant rate._** Currency impacts shown have been calculated as the current-period average GBP:USD rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior year quarter, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency, multiplied by the prior year quarter average GBP: USD rate, as a proxy for functional currency at constant rate movement.\n\n**_Currency Movement_** represents the difference between the results in our reporting currency (USD) and the results on a functional currency at constant rate basis.\n\nReconciliations from net income (loss), as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, to Adjusted EBITDA are shown below.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** Inspired management will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET / 1:00 p.m. UK on Friday, November 8, 2024 to discuss the financial results and general business trends.\n\n**_Telephone:_** The dial-in number to access the call live is 1-800-715-9871 (US) or 1-646-307-1963 (International).

(“Inspired” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: INSE), a leading B2B provider of gaming content, technology, hardware and services, today reported financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified business model and our ability to successfully execute across our business segments,” said Lorne Weil, Executive Chairman of Inspired. “Interactive continues to be a standout performer with revenue growing 40% year-over-year and EBITDA increasing 47%, driven by strong growth across key markets including the UK, North America, and mainland Europe. The segment's EBITDA margin expanded to 67.6%, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our digital business model. We're particularly encouraged by the substantial progress we’ve made in our Hybrid Dealer rollout strategy, successfully launching our MGM Bonus City game with BetMGM in Michigan and achieving a significant milestone with the commitment to our revolutionary Hybrid Dealer Roulette game in Canada by Loto-Québec. Moreover, our strategic partnership with FanDuel to integrate our Hybrid Dealer suite and develop content that is proprietary to FanDuel represents another major step forward in our North American expansion strategy.\n\n“In our Gaming segment, we’re seeing positive momentum from our operational initiatives, with EBITDA increasing 29% year-over-year despite more modest revenue growth, due to an improvement in our revenue mix for the quarter. We continue to execute on the opportunities before us in our Gaming segment, as exemplified by our major contract with Mecca Bingo to supply 170 state-of-the-art gaming machines through a five-year agreement. This follows our previously announced William Hill partnership, where we're proceeding with plans to deploy 5,000 new Vantage cabinets, the installation of which has begun and will be complete by the end of the first quarter, setting a foundation for growth in 2025 as these next-gen terminals have proven to drive consistent double-digit growth.\n\n“While Virtual Sports faced continued headwinds from a key customer, we’re seeing encouraging trends in the broader business with high single-digit revenue growth in the rest of the customer base driven by online performance. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain confident in the long-term growth trajectory of this high-margin business. The business continues to generate industry-leading margins of nearly 79% as we invest in strategic growth initiatives, particularly in Brazil, where we’re dedicating resources to capitalize on this significant market opportunity. We’re particularly excited about our new licensing agreement with the National Hockey League, which enhances our growing portfolio of major sports partnerships alongside the NFL and NBA. This agreement allows us to develop innovative interactive Virtual Sports games featuring NHL branding, further strengthening our offering in the North American and European markets.\n\n“In our Leisure segment, we delivered 5% revenue growth and a meaningful improvement in EBITDA margin to 30.6%. Our holiday park business showed steady growth with new site additions contributing to performance.\n\n“Lastly, we are thrilled to welcome James Richardson to the Inspired Entertainment team. James’s extensive background in financial management and his proven track record of driving growth and operational excellence make him an ideal fit for our company as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives and deliver value to our shareholders.\n\n“Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities: expanding our digital businesses, optimizing our land-based operations, and investing in new market opportunities. The strong performance of Interactive, improving profitability in Gaming, and our ongoing investments in Virtual Sports content and new markets give us confidence in our ability to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a licensing agreement with the National Hockey League (“NHL”) granting Inspired rights to develop interactive, fixed odds Virtual Sports games, featuring the NHL logo and NHL Club jerseys and names.\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced revolutionary Hybrid Dealer Roulette game in Canada with Loto-Québec that is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a long-term extension of its Virtual Sports partnership with OPAP, Greece’s leading gaming company, and will upgrade 4,000 Video Lottery Terminals (“VLTs”).\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end, announced a strategic partnership with FanDuel to integrate Inspired’s innovative Hybrid Dealer suite of content and develop a bespoke game tailored specifically for FanDuel’s audience.\n\n**Summary of Third Quarter 2024 Segment Financial Results**** _(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Reported Variance**| **Currency Movement 2024****2**| **Functional Currency Variance**  \n**(In $ millions)**| **2024**| **2023**| **%**| **$**| **%**  \n**_Total Revenue_**  \nGaming (excl.

We use these financial measures to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We believe that these measures are also commonly used in our industry to measure performance. For these reasons, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide expanded insight into our business, in addition to standard U.S. GAAP financial measures. There are no uniform rules for defining and using non-GAAP financial measures, and as a result the measures we use may not be comparable to measures used by other companies, even if they have similar labels. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP financial statements.\n\nWe define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\n\n**_EBITDA_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense, and other additional exclusions and adjustments (see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table)_._ Such additional excluded amounts include stock-based compensation U.S. GAAP charges where the associated liability is expected to be settled in stock, and changes in the value of earnout liabilities and income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where trading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the normal course of business, including (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2) merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a particularly useful performance measure, because it focuses on certain operating drivers of the business, including sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can provide a more complete understanding of our operating results and the trends to which we are subject, and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss, because it does not take into account certain aspects of our operating performance (for example, it excludes non-recurring gains and losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of underlying business activities)_._ Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the use by other companies of similarly termed measures. Management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several measures for evaluating our operating performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which affect depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income tax benefit (expense), are evaluated separately by management.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income_** is defined as net income (loss) excluding the effects of certain exclusions and adjustments. Such excluded amounts include income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where trading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the normal course of business, including (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2) merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business. These items have been adjusted to reflect the tax impact from excluding them from net income (loss).\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income per diluted share_** is computed by dividing the Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including the effects of any potentially dilutive securities, including RSUs, using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method, unless the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n\n**_Functional Currency at Constant rate._** Currency impacts shown have been calculated as the current-period average GBP:USD rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior year quarter, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency, multiplied by the prior year quarter average GBP: USD rate, as a proxy for functional currency at constant rate movement.\n\n**_Currency Movement_** represents the difference between the results in our reporting currency (USD) and the results on a functional currency at constant rate basis.\n\nReconciliations from net income (loss), as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, to Adjusted EBITDA are shown below.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** Inspired management will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET / 1:00 p.m. UK on Friday, November 8, 2024 to discuss the financial results and general business trends.\n\n**_Telephone:_** The dial-in number to access the call live is 1-800-715-9871 (US) or 1-646-307-1963 (International).

Actual\nresults, performance, liquidity, financial condition, prospects and opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, our forward-looking statements.

The Company recorded a net loss of $0.3 million and net income of $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nNet (loss) income includes non-cash stock-based compensation of $5.7 million and $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nHistorically, the Company has generally had positive cash flows from operating activities and has relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations and the incurrence\nof debt and/or the refinancing of existing debt to fund its obligations. Cash flows provided by operations amounted to $24.8 million and $43.0 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nManagement currently believes that the Company’s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, ability to control and defer capital projects and\namounts available from the Company’s external borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Company’s net cash requirements through November 2025.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed\nor omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a\ncomprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management’s opinion, however, that the accompanying unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results\nand cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The financial information as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements presented in\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. The financial information for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 is derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim or annual periods.\n6\n2. Allowance for Credit Losses\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nBeginning balance $ (1.1) $ (1.4)\nAdditional allowance for credit losses — (0.2)\nRecoveries — 0.2\nWrite offs — 0.4\nForeign currency translation adjustments (0.1) (0.1)\nEnding balance $ (1.2) $ (1.1)\n3.

Our finished goods inventory primarily consists of gaming terminals which are ready for sale.\n4. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nPrepaid expenses and other assets $ 23.0 $ 15.6\nUnbilled accounts receivable 27.1 24.0\nTotal prepaid expenses and other assets $ 50.1 $ 39.6\n5. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nAccounts payable $ 30.9 $ 41.9\nInterest payable 8.9 —\nPayroll and related costs 4.1 5.5\nCost of sales including inventory 5.4 6.4\nOther 11.1 7.0\n$ 60.4 $ 60.8\n6. Contract Related Disclosures\nThe following table summarizes contract related balances:\nUnbilled Right to Customer\nAccounts Accounts recover Deferred Prepayments\nReceivable Receivable asset Income and Deposits\n(in millions)\nAt September 30, 2024 $ 45.1 $ 27.1 $ 0.7 $ (17.6) $ (3.1)\nAt December 31, 2023 $ 42.8 $ 24.0 $ 0.6 $ (12.7) $ (2.9)\nRevenue recognized that was included in the deferred income balance at the beginning of the periods amounted to $2.1 million and $3.9 million, as restated, for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, there was no significant amounts of revenue recognized as a result of changes in contract transaction price\nrelated to performance obligations that were satisfied in the respective prior periods.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nAt September 30, 2024, the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts expected to be greater than one year, or performance obligations for\nwhich we do not have a right to consideration from the customer in the amount that corresponds to the value to the customer for our performance completed to date, variable\nconsideration which is not accounted for in accordance with the sales-based or usage-based royalties guidance, or contracts which are not wholly unperformed, was approximately\n$96.2 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize as revenue approximately 12% through December 31, 2024, approximately 60% through December 31, 2026, and the remaining\n28% through December 31, 2030.\n7\n7. Long term Debt\nSenior Secured Notes\nLong-term debt consists of £235.0 million ($315.2 million) of Senior Secured Notes and $2.8 million of capitalized debt fees which are being amortized over the length of the\nSenior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.875% and are fully repayable on June 1, 2026.\nUnder our debt facilities in place as of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to covenant testing on our senior secured notes (the “Senior Secured Notes”). We are, however,\nsubject to covenant testing at the level of Inspired Entertainment Inc., the ultimate holding company, on our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “RCF Agreement”) which\nrequired the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio of 6.0x on March 31, 2022, stepping down to 5.75x on March 31, 2023 and 5.50x from\nMarch 31, 2024 and thereafter (the “RCF Financial Covenant”). The RCF Financial Covenant is calculated as the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro\nforma EBITDA (defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense) for the 12-month period preceding the relevant\nquarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the Initial Facility (as defined in the RCF Agreement) being drawn on the relevant test date. The RCF\nFinancial Covenant does not include a minimum interest coverage ratio or other financial covenants. Covenant testing at September 30, 2024 showed covenant compliance with a net\nleverage of 3.1x.\nThere were no covenant violations in the period ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants and certain reporting requirements including the requirement to provide the lender, within 60 days after the\nclose of the quarter, unaudited quarterly financial statements with footnote disclosures. In the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company was unable to comply with this\nrequirement due to the requirement to restate previously reported financial statements as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2023. The debt\nagreement allows the Company a 30-day grace period to provide such financial information once they receive any notice of non-compliance. No such notice was received. Concurrent\nwith the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 with the SEC on February 27, 2024, the reporting requirement was met.\n8. Stock-Based Compensation\nA summary of the Company’s Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\nUnvested Outstanding at January 1, 2024 (1) 1,242,175\nGranted (2) 620,934\nForfeited (185,468)\nVested (110,647)\nUnvested Outstanding at September 30, 2024 1,566,994\n(1) The amount shown as “unvested outstanding at January 1, 2024” does not include certain tranches of Adjusted EBITDA RSUs that have performance criteria for annual periods\nlater than 2023 (an aggregate of 312,500 RSUs, including 62,500 subject to 2024 criteria), which were part of sign-on tranches approved for our Executive Chairman and our\nChief Executive Officer during the years 2021 and 2023, as the applicable performance targets were not set by January 1, 2024 (and, accordingly, the accounting grant dates had\nnot yet occurred for the tranches). Such tranches had previously been included in the amounts shown in 2023 as unvested outstanding since the initial approval date for the\ntranches.\n(2) The amount shown as “granted” includes 245,694 performance-based target RSUs for 2024 as to which the number that ultimately vests would range from 0% to 200% of the\ntarget amount of RSUs (a maximum of 491,388 RSUs based on attainment of Adjusted EBITDA targets for 2024). The amount shown also includes a tranche of 62,500 Adjusted\nEBITDA RSUs (subject to performance criteria for 2024) which can be earned at up to 100% of the target amount of RSUs; such tranche was part of a sign-on award of multiple\ntranches approved in 2021 for our Executive Chairman with respect to which the accounting grant date for the 2024 tranche did not occur until the targets were set in February\n2024.\nThe Company issued a total of 355,783 shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the Company’s equity-based plans, which included an\naggregate of 333,161 shares issued in connection with the net settlement of RSUs that vested during the prior year (primarily on December 29, 2023).\n9. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (Income)\nThe accumulated balances for each classification of comprehensive loss (income) are presented below:\nForeign Change in Accumulated\nCurrency Fair Value Unrecognized Other\nTranslation of Hedging Pension Comprehensive\nAdjustments Instrument Benefit Costs (Income)\n(in millions)\nBalance at January 1, 2024 $ (78.3) $ — $ 33.8 $ (44.5)\nChange during the period (1.0) — (0.3) (1.3)\nBalance at March 31, 2024 (79.3) — 33.5 (45.8)\nChange during the period 0.2 — (0.3) (0.1)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 (79.1) — 33.2 (45.9)\nChange during the period 6.3 — (0.3) 6.0\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (72.8) $ — $ 32.9 $ (39.9)\nForeign Change in Accumulated\nCurrency Fair Value Unrecognized Other\nTranslation of Hedging Pension Comprehensive\nAdjustments Instrument Benefit Costs (Income)\n(in millions)\nBalance at January 1, 2023 $ (84.2) $ 0.3 $ 33.1 $ (50.8)\nChange during the period 2.9 (0.2) (0.2) 2.5\nBalance at March 31, 2023 (81.3) 0.1 32.9 (48.3)\nChange during the period 2.7 (0.1) (0.3) 2.3\nBalance at June 30, 2023 (78.6) — 32.6 (46.0)\nChange during the period (3.6) — (0.2) (3.8)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (82.2) $ — $ 32.4 $ (49.8)\n8\nIn connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, and the entry into the RCF Agreement, on May 19, 2021, the Company terminated all of its interest rate swaps.\nAccordingly, hedge accounting is no longer applicable. The amounts previously recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income were amortized into Interest expense over the\nterms of the hedged forecasted interest payments. Losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 amounted to $0.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\n10. Net Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic income/loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income/loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during\nthe period, including stock options and RSUs, unless the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nThe computation of diluted EPS excludes the common stock equivalents of the following potentially dilutive securities because they were contingently issuable shares or because\ntheir inclusion would be anti-dilutive:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRSUs 574,465 805,619 1,566,994 805,619\nThe following tables reconcile the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations. There were no reconciling items for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024:\nIncome (Numerator)\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Shares (Denominator) Per-Share Amount\nBasic EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 3.4 28,496,801 $ 0.12\nEffect of Dilutive Securities\nRSUs — 691,986 $ —\nDiluted EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 3.4 $ 29,188,787 $ 0.12\nIncome (Numerator)\nThree months ended September 30, 2023 (in millions) Shares (Denominator) Per-Share Amount\nBasic EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 3.4 28,104,365 $ 0.12\nEffect of Dilutive Securities\nRSUs — 1,000,902 $ —\nDiluted EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 3.4 $ 29,105,267 $ 0.12\n9\nIncome (Numerator)\nNine months ended September 30, 2023 (in millions) Shares (Denominator) Per-Share Amount\nBasic EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 7.6 28,088,901 $ 0.27\nEffect of Dilutive Securities\nRSUs — 1,060,384 $ (0.01)\nDiluted EPS\nIncome available to common stockholders $ 7.6 $ 29,149,285 $ 0.26\nThe calculation of Basic EPS includes the effects of 1,921,997 and 1,790,728 shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with respect\nto RSU awards that have vested but have not yet been issued.\n11. Other Finance Income (Expense)\nOther finance income (expense) consisted of the following for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions) (in millions)\nPension interest cost $ (0.9) $ (0.8) $ (2.7) $ (2.5)\nExpected return on pension plan assets 1.0 0.9 3.0 2.8\n$ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 0.3\n12. Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.3% and 37.6%, respectively, resulting in a $1.0 million and $2.0 million income tax\nexpense, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 56.8% and 27.6%, respectively, resulting in a $0.4 million income tax\nbenefit and a $2.8 million income tax expense, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate reported in any given year will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors including the level of pre-tax income or loss, the income mix between\njurisdictions, and any discrete items that may occur.\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We intend to continue maintaining a\nfull valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current\nearnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a\nsignificant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease\nto income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of\nprofitability that we are able to actually achieve.\n10\n13. Related Parties\nMacquarie Corporate Holdings Pty Limited (UK Branch) (“Macquarie UK”) (an arranger and lending party under our RCF Agreement) is an affiliate of MIHI LLC, which\nbeneficially owned approximately 11.4% of our common stock as of September 30, 2024. Macquarie UK held $2.2 million of the total $20.1 million of RCF drawn at September 30,\n2024, and $2.1 million of the total $19.1 million of RCF drawn at December 31, 2023. Interest expense payable to Macquarie UK for the RCF for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (including non-utilization fees) amounted to $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (including non-utilization fees) amounted to $0.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Macquarie UK did not hold any of the Company’s senior notes at\nSeptember 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. MIHI LLC is also a party to a stockholders agreement with the Company and other stockholders, dated December 23, 2016, pursuant to\nwhich, subject to certain conditions, MIHI LLC, jointly with Hydra Industries Sponsor LLC, are permitted to designate two directors to be nominated for election as directors of the\nCompany at any annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, until such time as MIHI LLC and Hydra Industries Sponsor LLC in the aggregate hold\nless than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company.\nRichard Weil, the brother of A. Lorne Weil, our Executive Chairman, provides consulting services to the Company relating to our lottery operations in the Dominican Republic\nunder a consultancy agreement dated December 31, 2021, as amended. The aggregate amount incurred by the Company in consulting fees was $37,500 and $37,500 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $112,500 and $97,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively\n14. Leases\nCertain of our arrangements include leases for equipment installed at customer locations. As the lessor, we combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying\nassets in arrangements that involve operating leases. The single combined component is accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers based on the\nconsideration that the non-lease components are the predominant items in the arrangements. If a component cannot be combined, the consideration is allocated between the lease\ncomponent and the non-lease component based on relative standalone selling price. The lease component is accounted for under ASC 842, Leases and the non-lease component is\naccounted for under ASC 606.\nLease income from operating leases is not material for any of the periods presented. Lease income from sales type leases is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions) (in millions)\nInterest receivable $ 0.2 — $ 0.5 —\nProfit recognized at commencement date of sales type leases 0.7 — 2.0 —\n$ 0.9 $ — $ 2.5 $ —\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company entered into a finance lease agreement for machine purchases with CSJ SPV, LLC, of which HG Vora\nOpportunistic Capital Master Fund II LP is the Managing Member for $21.0 million which will be repaid over six years by way of structured quarterly repayments inclusive of\nprincipal and interest.\n15. Commitments and Contingencies\nEmployment Agreements\nWe are party to employment agreements with our executive officers and other employees of the Company and our subsidiaries which contain, among other terms, provisions\nrelating to severance and notice requirements.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in lawsuits and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company believes that, currently, it has\nno such matters that are material, there can be no assurance that existing or new matters arising in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11\n16. Pension Plan\nWe operate a defined contribution plan in the US, and both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK. The defined contribution scheme assets are held\nseparately from those of the Company in independently administered funds.\nDefined Benefit Pension Scheme\nThe defined benefit scheme has been closed to new entrants since April 1, 1999 and closed to future accruals for services rendered to the Company for the entire financial\nstatement periods presented. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme (as at March 31, 2021), which was finalized in June 2022, determined that the statutory funding objective was\nnot met, i.e., there were insufficient assets to cover the scheme’s technical provisions and there was a funding shortfall.\nIn June 2022, a recovery plan was put in place to eliminate the funding shortfall. The plan expects the shortfall to be eliminated by October 31, 2026.\nThe following table presents the components of our net periodic pension cost (benefit):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2023\n(in millions)\nComponents of net periodic pension cost (benefit):\nInterest cost $ 2.7 $ 2.5\nExpected return on plan assets (3.0) (2.8)\nAmortization of net loss 0.8 0.7\nNet periodic cost (benefit) $ 0.5 $ 0.4\n17. Segment Reporting and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates its business along four operating segments, which are segregated on the basis of revenue stream: Gaming, Virtual Sports, Interactive and Leisure. The\nCompany believes this method of segment reporting reflects both the way its business segments are managed and the way the performance of each segment is evaluated.\nThe following tables present revenue, cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense and\ndepreciation and amortization, operating income (loss) and total long-lived asset expenditures for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, by\nbusiness segment. Certain unallocated corporate function costs have not been allocated to the Company’s reportable operating segments because these costs are not allocable and to do\nso would not be practical. Corporate function costs consist primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures relating to\ncorporate/shared functions.\nSegment Information\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nVirtual Corporate\nGaming Sports Interactive Leisure Functions Total\n(in millions)\nRevenue:\nService $ 19.9 $ 11.2 $ 10.2 $ 32.5 $ — $ 73.8\nProduct sales 3.4 — — 0.8 — 4.2\nTotal revenue 23.3 11.2 10.2 33.3 — 78.0\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and\namortization:\nCost of service (4.8) (0.5) (0.5) (14.9) — (20.7)\nCost of product sales (2.3) — — (0.4) — (2.7)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (6.7) (1.9) (2.8) (7.8) (10.4) (29.6)\nStock-based compensation expense (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) (1.3) (1.8)\nDepreciation and amortization (5.0) (1.3) (1.3) (3.1) (0.6) (11.3)\nSegment operating income (loss) 4.4 7.4 5.5 6.9 (12.3) 11.9\nNet operating income $ 11.9\nTotal capital and other long-lived intangible\nasset expenditures for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 1.7 $ 1.9 $ 0.7 $ 2.8 $ 1.3 $ 8.4\n12\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nVirtual Corporate\nGaming Sports Interactive Leisure Functions Total\n(in millions)\nRevenue:\nService $ 18.9 $ 13.4 $ 7.3 $ 31.1 $ — $ 70.7\nProduct sales 26.2 — — 0.6 — 26.8\nTotal revenue 45.1 13.4 7.3 31.7 — 97.5\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and\namortization:\nCost of service (5.5) (0.2) (0.5) (15.2) — (21.4)\nCost of product sales (26.2) — — (0.5) — (26.7)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (5.1) (1.5) (2.1) (7.3) (7.6) (23.6)\nStock-based compensation expense (0.4) (0.2) (0.1) (0.2) (2.4) (3.3)\nDepreciation and amortization (5.1) (0.7) (0.9) (3.0) (0.6) (10.3)\nSegment operating income (loss) 2.8 10.8 3.7 5.5 (10.6) 12.2\nNet operating income $ 12.2\nTotal capital and other long-lived intangible\nasset expenditures for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 $ 12.8 $ 1.6 $ 0.7 $ 1.6 $ 0.1 $ 16.8\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nVirtual Corporate\nGaming Sports Interactive Leisure Functions Total\n(in millions)\nRevenue:\nService $ 56.4 $ 35.3 $ 27.7 $ 77.3 $ — $ 196.7\nProduct sales 18.0 — — 2.0 — 20.0\nTotal revenue 74.4 35.3 27.7 79.3 — 216.7\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and\namortization:\nCost of service (15.7) (1.0) (1.6) (37.3) — (55.6)\nCost of product sales (12.2) — — (0.8) — (13.0)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (19.7) (5.5) (8.7) (23.1) (33.7) (90.7)\nStock-based compensation expense (0.5) (0.3) (0.3) (0.4) (4.2) (5.7)\nDepreciation and amortization (12.7) (4.7) (3.7) (9.1) (1.6) (31.8)\nSegment operating income (loss) 13.6 23.8 13.4 8.6 (39.5) 19.9\nNet operating income $ 19.9\nTotal capital and other long-lived intangible\nasset expenditures for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 5.9 $ 7.9 $ 1.6 $ 10.3 $ 3.0 $ 28.7\n13\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nVirtual Corporate\nGaming Sports Interactive Leisure Functions Total\n(in millions)\nRevenue:\nService $ 58.9 $ 43.3 $ 19.9 $ 73.6 $ — $ 195.7\nProduct sales 44.4 — — 1.7 — 46.1\nTotal revenue 103.3 43.3 19.9 75.3 — 241.8\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and\namortization:\nCost of service (17.9) (1.0) (1.2) (36.8) — (56.9)\nCost of product sales (40.4) — — (1.4) — (41.8)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (15.8) (4.8) (7.3) (21.0) (24.5) (73.4)\nStock-based compensation expense (1.1) (0.6) (0.4) (0.7) (6.5) (9.3)\nDepreciation and amortization (14.2) (2.3) (2.5) (9.1) (1.7) (29.8)\nSegment operating income (loss) 13.9 34.6 8.5 6.3 (32.7) 30.6\nNet operating loss $ 30.6\nTotal capital and other long-lived intangible\nasset expenditures for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 $ 17.3 $ 3.2 $ 2.3 $ 10.6 $ 1.6 $ 35.0\nGeographic Information\nGeographic information for revenue is set forth below:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions) (in millions)\nTotal revenue\nUK $ 60.5 $ 79.8 $ 164.5 $ 190.6\nGreece 5.3 5.2 16.0 16.1\nRest of world 12.2 12.5 36.2 35.1\nTotal $ 78.0 $ 97.5 $ 216.7 $ 241.8\nUK revenue includes revenue from customers headquartered in the UK, but whose revenue is generated globally.\nGeographic information of our non-current assets excluding goodwill is set forth below:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nUK $ 119.3 $ 91.9\nGreece 15.3 15.3\nRest of world 26.7 22.4\nTotal $ 161.3 $ 129.6\nSoftware development costs are included as attributable to the market in which they are utilized.\n18.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto\nincluded elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ materially from the\nhistorical results discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those referenced in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” included in our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe make forward-looking statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For definitions of the term Forward-Looking\nStatements, see the definitions provided in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the forepart of this report.\nSeasonality\nOur results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines can vary quarter on quarter due to both supply and demand factors.\nPlayer activity for our holiday parks is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months and slower during the first and fourth\nquarters of the year.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue in four principal ways: i) on a participation basis, ii) on a fixed rental fee basis, iii) through product sales and iv) through software license fees. Participation\nrevenue generally includes a right to receive a share of our customers’ gaming revenue, typically as a share of net win but sometimes as a share of the handle or “coin in” which\nrepresents the total amount wagered.\nGeographic Range\nGeographically, the majority of our revenue is derived from, and the majority of our non-current assets are attributable to, our UK operations. The remainder of our revenue is derived\nfrom, and non-current assets attributable to, Greece and the rest of the world (including North America).\nFor the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approximately 77% and 76% of our revenue from the UK (including customers headquartered in the UK but\nwhose revenue is generated globally), respectively, 7% (in both periods) from Greece, and the remaining 16% and 17% respectively across the rest of the world. For the three and nine-\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we derived approximately 82% and 79% of our revenue from the UK (including customers headquartered in the UK but whose revenue is\ngenerated globally), respectively, 5% and 7% from Greece, respectively, and the remaining 13% and 14% respectively across the rest of the world. The UK percentage was impacted\nby specific Hardware sales, which generally result in a lower margin (“Low Margin sales”), which contributed UK revenues for the three-month period by 39% and for the nine-month\nperiod by 16%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows: 74% to the UK, 9% to Greece and 17% across the rest of the world. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows: 71% to the UK, 11% to Greece and 18% across the rest of the world.\n15\nForeign Exchange\nOur results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the translation of foreign functional currencies into our reporting currency and the re-measurement\nof foreign currency transactions and balances. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represents the difference between current rates and prior-period rates applied\nto current activity. The geographic region in which the largest portion of our business is operated is the UK and the British pound (“GBP”) is considered to be our functional currency.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Our results are translated from our functional currency of GBP into the reporting currency of USD using average rates for profit and\nloss transactions and applicable spot rates for period-end balances. The effect of translating our functional currency into our reporting currency, as well as translating the results of\nforeign subsidiaries that have a different functional currency into our functional currency, is reported separately in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\nDuring the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approximately 23% and 24% of our revenue from sales to customers outside the UK, respectively (see caveat\nabove), compared to 18% and 21% during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nIn the section “Results of Operations” below, currency impacts shown have been calculated as the current-period average GBP:USD rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior\nyear period, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the\ndifference in our functional currency, multiplied by the prior-period average GBP:USD rate. This is not a U.S. GAAP measure but is one which management believes gives a clearer\nindication of results. In the tables below, variances in particular line items from period to period exclude currency translation movements, and currency translation impacts are shown\nindependently.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain financial measures that are not compliant with U.S. GAAP (“Non-GAAP financial measures”), including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, to analyze our operating\nperformance. In this discussion and analysis, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures, define and explain these measures and provide reconciliations to the most comparable\nU.S. GAAP measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nResults of Operations\nOur results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between our functional currency (GBP) and our reporting currency (USD). During the periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the average GBP:USD rates for the three-month period were 1.30 and 1.27, respectively, and for the nine-month period were 1.28 and\n1.25, respectively.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations has been organized in the following manner:\n● a discussion and analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023; and\n● a discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each of the Company’s segments (Gaming, Virtual Sports, Interactive and Leisure) for the three and nine-month\nperiods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, including key performance indicator (“KPI”) analysis.\nIn the discussion and analysis below, certain data may vary from the amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements due to rounding.\nFor all reported variances, refer to the overall company and segment tables shown below. All variances discussed in the overall company and segment results are on a functional\ncurrency (at constant rate) basis, which excludes the impact of any changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nKey Events for the Quarter\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 in the Gaming segment, OPAP in Greece ordered 4,000 new VLT’s, expected delivery in country is for 2,400 in H1 2025,\nwith the final balance of 1,600 in Q4 2025.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 we joined the Scientific Games Content Hub Partner Program, the global lottery industry’s premier content delivery\nplatform, enabling Inspired to distribute to Scientific Games iLottery customers around the world.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the Interactive segment went live with seventeen new operators. The total number of customers at the end of the period\nincreased by twelve overall due to the closure of several smaller-scale customers.\nKey agreements made in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 include a contract with Mecca Bingo for the provision of gaming machines, including the installation of\n150 terminals with expected deployment in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a five-year machine supply agreement with Carlton Bingo, both in the Leisure segment.\n16\nOverall Company Results\nThree and Nine-Months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Three and Nine-Months ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Three-Month For the Nine-Month\nPeriod ended Variance Period ended Variance\nSeptember September September September\n(In millions) 30, 30, 2024 vs 2023 30, 30, 2024 vs 2023\nVariance Total Variance Total\nVariance on a Functional Total Variance on a Functional Total\nAttributable Functional Currency Reported Attributable Functional Currency Reported\nto Currency currency Variance Variance to Currency currency Variance Variance\n2024 2023 Movement basis % % 2024 2023 Movement basis % %\nRevenue:\nService $ 73.8 $ 70.7 $ $1.9 $ 1.2 2% 4% $ 196.7 $ 195.7 $ 5.0 $ (4.0) (2)% 1%\nProduct 4.2 26.8 0.1 (22.7 (85)% (84)% 20.0 46.1 0.1 (26.2) (57)% (57)%\nTotal\nrevenue 78.0 97.5 2.0 (21.5) (22)% (20)% 216.7 241.8 5.1 (30.2) (12)% (10)%\nCost of Sales,\nexcluding\ndepreciation\nand\namortization\nCost of\nService (20.7) (21.4) (0.8) 1.5 (7)% (3)% (55.6) (56.9) (1.4) 2.7 (5)% (2)%\nCost of\nProduct (2.7) (26.7) (0.2) 24.2 (91)% (90)% (13.0) (41.8) (0.1) 28.9 (69)% (69)%\nSelling,\ngeneral and\nadministrative\nexpenses (29.6) (23.6) (0.5) (5.5) 23% 25% (90.7) (73.4) (2.2) (15.1) 21% 24%\nStock-based\ncompensation (1.8) (3.3) (0.1) 1.6 (48)% (45)% (5.7) (9.3) (0.2) 3.8 (41)% (39)%\nDepreciation\nand\namortization (11.3) (10.3) (0.3) (0.7) 7% 10% (31.8) (29.8) (0.8) (1.2) 4% 7%\nNet\noperating\nIncome 11.9 12.2 0.1 (0.4) (3)% (2)% 19.9 30.6 0.4 (11.1) (36)% (35)%\nOther\nincome\n(expense)\nInterest\nexpense, net (7.6) (6.9) (0.4) (0.3) 4% 10% (20.9) (20.5) (0.9) 0.5 (2)% 2%\nOther finance\nincome\n(expense) 0.1 0.1 - - N/A N/A 0.3 0.3 - - N/A N/A\nTotal other\nincome\n(expense),\nnet (7.5) (6.8) (0.4) (0.3) 4% 10% (20.6) (20.2) (0.9) 0.5 (2)% 2%\nNet\nIncome\n(loss)\nfrom\ncontinuing\noperations\nbefore\nincome\ntaxes 4.4 5.4 (0.3) (0.7) (13)% (19)% (0.7) 10.4 (0.5) (10.6) (102)% (107)%\nIncome tax\nexpense (1.0) (2.0) (0.3) 1.3 (65)% (50)% 0.4 (2.8) (0.1) 3.3 (118)% (114)%\nNet\nIncome\n(Loss) $ 3.4 $ 3.4 $ (0.6) $ 0.6 18% 0% $ (0.3) $ 7.6 $ (0.6) $ (7.3) (96)% (104)%\nExchange\nRate - $ to £ 1.30 1.27 1.28 1.25\nSee “Segments Results” below for a more detailed explanation of the significant changes in our components of revenue within the individual segment results of operations.\n17\nRevenue (for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023)\nConsolidated Reported Revenue by Segment\n● There were no Low Margin-related sales for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 Low Margin-related\nsales were $22.7 million and $27.1 million, respectively.\nFor the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, revenue on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis decreased by $21.5 million and $30.2 million compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Gaming revenue declined by $22.4 million predominantly due to a decrease in product sales of $22.8 million, of which $22.7\nmillion were Low Margin sales. Gaming service revenue grew by $0.4 million predominately due to growth in North America and a customer bonus included the UK. Virtual Sports\nrevenue declined by $2.5 million, with $2.2 million of the reduction from Online. Interactive revenue grew by $2.7 million with growth driven in the UK and North American markets.\nLeisure revenue grew by $0.7 million, predominately driven by growth in the Holiday Parks and Motorway Service Area sectors.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Gaming revenue declined by $30.6 million predominantly due to a decrease in product sales of $26.5 million, of which $27.1\nmillion were Low Margin sales. Gaming service revenue declined by $4.1 million, predominately due to declines in the UK, mainland Europe and Greece. Virtual Sports declined by\n$9.0 million, with $8.7 million of the reduction coming from Online. Interactive revenue grew by $7.2 million, which was driven by growth in the UK, mainland Europe and North\nAmerica. Leisure grew by $2.2 million, predominantly driven by growth in the Holiday Parks and Pubs sectors.\n18\nCost of Sales, excluding depreciation and amortization\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $25.7 million and $31.6 million, respectively, or 53%\nand 32% respectively. The decreases were driven by $24.2 million and $28.9 million decreases in cost of product, respectively, predominately driven by the decrease in low margin\nproduct sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $5.5 million and $15.1 million, respectively, or 23% and\n21%, respectively.\nThe increase during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in exceptional items of $4.0 million predominantly due to the costs of the\nrestatement of our prior financial statements and the costs of group restructuring, along with increases in IT costs of $0.7 million and storage and distribution costs of $0.5 million\nThe increase during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by the $10.6 million costs of the restatement of our prior financial statements, an increase\nin non-staff costs of $4.6 million, predominantly driven by increases in storage and distribution, IT and facility costs\nStock-based compensation\nDuring the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded expenses of $1.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively, compared to expenses of $3.3 million and\n$9.3 million for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023. All expenses were related to outstanding awards but the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, included $0.4\nmillion related to award units that were fully vested on the date of grant and therefore were expensed immediately and also included $0.7 million related to the costs of the restatement\nof our prior financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by $0.7 million driven mainly by an increase in Virtual Sports of $0.5 million for\nincreased software development\nDepreciation and amortization for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1.2 million driven by increases in Virtuals of $2.2 million and Interactive of $1.4\nmillion for increased software development and intangible assets, offset by reductions in Gaming of $1.8 million and Leisure of $0.2 million as machine assets unwind.\n19\nNet operating income / Net income / (Loss)\nDuring the three and nine-month period ended September 30,2024, net operating income was $11.9 million and $19.9 million, respectively, representing declines of $0.4 million and\n$11.1 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily driven by the increase in SG&A and\ndepreciation and amortization, partially offset by increase in gross margin and reduction in stock-based compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the\ndecrease was primarily driven by the increase in SG&A and expenses partially offset by the increase in gross margin and reduction in stock-based compensation.\nFor the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, net income / (loss) was $3.4 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, compared to net income of $3.4 million and $7.6\nmillion, respectively, in the prior year periods.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by the decrease in net operating\nincome and increase in interest expense.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in net operating income, partially offset by decreases in interest expense and\nincome tax expense.\nDeferred Tax\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation\nallowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and\nanticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next six months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a\nconclusion that a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax\nassets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on\nthe basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nSegment Results (for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023)\nGaming\nWe generate revenue from our Gaming segment through delivery of our gaming terminals preloaded with proprietary gaming software, server-based content, as well as services such as\nterminal repairs, maintenance, software upgrades and upgrades on a when and if available basis and content development. We receive rental fees for machines, typically in conjunction\nwith long-term contracts, on both a participation and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our\noperator customers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and any relevant regulatory levies) from gaming terminals placed in our customers’ facilities. Typically, we\nrecognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract.\nRevenue growth for our Gaming business is principally driven by changes in (i) the number of operator customers we have, (ii) the number of Gaming machines in operation, (iii) the\nnet win performance of the machines and (iv) the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.\n20\nGaming, Key Performance Indicators\nFor the Three-Month For the Nine-Month\nPeriod ended Variance Period ended Variance\nSeptember 30, September 30, 2024 vs 2023 September 30, September 30, 2024 vs 2023\nGaming 2024 2023 % 2024 2023 %\nEnd of period installed base (# of\nterminals) (2) 34,875 34,096 779 2.3% 34,875 34,096 779 2.3%\nTotal Gaming - Average installed\nbase (# of terminals) (2) 34,897 34,216 681 2.0% 34,853 34,570 283 0.8%\nParticipation - Average installed\nbase (# of terminals) (2) 29,937 30,137 (200) (0.1)% 29,896 30,484 (588) (1.9)%\nFixed Rental - Average installed\nbase (# of terminals) 4,960 4,080 880 21.6% 4,957 4,086 871 21.3%\nService Only - Average installed\nbase (# of terminals) 4,942 10,208 (5,266) (51.6)% 6,032 12,422 (6,390) (51.4)%\nCustomer Gross Win per unit per\nday (1) (2) £ 95.2 £ 91.9 £ 3.3 3.6% £ 96.7 £ 94.8 £ 1.9 2.0%\nCustomer Net Win per unit per day\n(1) (2) £ 70.0 £ 67.2 £ 2.8 4.2% £ 71.0 £ 69.2 £ 1.8 2.6%\nInspired Blended Participation Rate 5.3% 5.7% (0.4%) (7.0)% 5.4% 5.7% (0.3)% (5.3)%\nInspired Fixed Rental Revenue per\nGaming Machine per week £ 39.2 £ 53.8 £ (14.6) (27.1)% £ 40.1 £ 50.6 £ (10.5) (20.8)%\nInspired Service Rental Revenue per\nGaming Machine per week £ 5.0 £ 4.9 £ 0.1 2.0% £ 5.1 £ 5.1 £ - 0%\nGaming Long term license\namortization (£’m) £ 0.5 £ 0.6 £ (0.1) (16.7)% £ 1.6 £ 2.1 £ (0.5) (23.8)%\nNumber of Machine sales 303 5,000 (4,697) (93.9)% 1,597 7,211 (5,614) (77.9)%\nAverage selling price per terminal £ 7,370 £ 4,056 £ (3,314) (81.7)% £ 7,846 £ 4,764 £ 3,082 64.7%\n(1) Includes all SBG terminals in which the Company takes a participation revenue share across all territories.\n(2) Includes circa 2,500 of lottery terminals where the share is on handle instead of net win.\nIn the table above:\n“End of Period Installed Base” is equal to the number of deployed Gaming terminals at the end of each period that have been placed on a participation or fixed rental basis.\nGaming participation revenue, which comprises the majority of Gaming Service revenue, is directly related to the participation terminal installed base. This is the medium by which\nour customers generate revenue and distribute a revenue share to the Company. To the extent all other KPIs and certain other factors remain constant, the larger the installed base, the\nhigher the Company’s revenue would be for a given period. Management gives careful consideration to this KPI in terms of driving growth across the segment. This does not include\nService Only terminals.\n21\nRevenue is derived from the performance of the installed base as described by the Gross and Net Win KPIs.\nIf the End of Period Installed Base is materially different from the Average Installed Base (described below), we believe this gives an indication as to potential future performance.\nWe believe the End of Period Installed Base is particularly useful for assessing new customers or markets, to indicate the progress being made with respect to entering new territories\nor jurisdictions.\n“Total Gaming - Average Installed Base” is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals during the period consisting of both participation terminals and fixed rental\nterminals. Therefore, it is more closely aligned to revenue in the period. We believe this measure is particularly useful for assessing existing customers or markets to provide\ncomparisons of historical size and performance. This does not include Service Only terminals.\n“Participation - Average Installed Base” is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a participation basis.\n“Fixed Rental - Average Installed Base” is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a fixed rental basis.\n“Service Only - Average Installed Base” is the average number of terminals that generated revenue on a service only basis.\n“Customer Gross Win per unit per day” is a KPI used by our management to (i) assess impact on the Company’s revenue, (ii) determine changes in the performance of the overall\nmarket and (iii) evaluate the impacts of regulatory change and our new content releases on our customers. Customer Gross Win per unit per day is the average per unit cash generated\nacross all Gaming terminals in which the Company takes a participation revenue share across all territories in the period, defined as the difference between the amounts staked less\nwinnings to players divided by the Average Installed Base in the period, then divided by the number of days in the period.\nGaming revenue accrued in the period is derived from Customer Gross Win accrued in the period after deducting gaming taxes (defined as a regulatory levy paid by the Customer\nto government bodies) and applying the Company’s contractual revenue share percentage.\nOur management believes Customer Gross Win measures are meaningful because they represent a view of customer operating performance that is unaffected by our revenue share\npercentage and allow management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between customers and (3) identify strategies to improve\noperating performance in the different markets in which we operate.\n“Customer Net Win per unit per day” is Customer Gross Win per unit per day after giving effect to the deduction of gaming taxes.\n“Inspired Blended Participation Rate” is the Company’s average revenue share percentage across all participation terminals where revenue is earned on a participation basis,\nweighted by Customer Net Win per unit per day.\n“Inspired Fixed Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week” is the Company’s average fixed rental amount across all fixed rental terminals where revenue is generated on a\nfixed fee basis, per unit per week.\n“Inspired Service Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week” is the Company’s average service rental amount across all service only rental terminals where revenue is\ngenerated on a service only fixed fee basis, per unit per week.\n“Gaming Long term license amortization” is the upfront license fee per terminal which is typically spread over the life of the terminal.\n22\nOur overall Gaming revenue from terminals placed on a participation basis can therefore be calculated as the product of the Participation - Average Installed Base, the Customer\nNet Win per unit per day, the number of days in the period, and the Inspired Blended Participation Rate, which is equal to “Participation Revenue”.\n“Number of Machine sales” is the number of terminals sold during the period.\n“Average selling price per terminal” is the total revenue in GBP of the Gaming terminals sold divided by the “number of Machine sales”.\nGaming, Recurring Revenue\nSet forth below is a breakdown of our Gaming recurring revenue.

This was driven by decreases in\nProduct revenue of $22.8 million and $26.5 million, respectively. Gaming service revenue increased by $0.4 million and decreased by $4.1 million, respectively.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the increase in Gaming Service revenue was driven by higher revenue from North America of $0.7 million due to increased\ngame pack subscriptions and UK LBO of $0.5 million as the current year period included a customer bonus not included in the prior year period.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Service revenue was driven by decreases of $2.1 million in the UK market inclusive of shop closures in\nUK LBO and $ 1.1 million in the Greek market, primarily due to the reduction in Gross Win per day and expiry of historical amortized license revenues.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by lower UK Product sales of $22.8 million, of which $22.7\nmillion were Low Margin sales.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by lower UK Product sales of $26.5 million, of which $27.1\nmillion were Low Margin sales.\n25\nGaming Operating Income\nNet income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1.6 million and decreased by $0.8 million respectively.\nThe three-month ended September 30, 2024 increase was primarily due to higher gross margin (as the $22.4 million revenue decrease was offset by a $24.9 million decrease in total\ncost of sales mainly driven by the decrease in Low Margin sales in the current period).\nThe decrease during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million due to unwind of machine assets\nand stock-based compensation of $0.6 million, offset by an increase in SG&A costs of $3.5 million driven by increased staff cost, reduced overhead recoveries along with the cost of\ngroup restructuring not incurred in the prior year period.\nVirtual Sports\nWe generate revenue from our Virtual Sports segment through the on-premise solution and hosting of our products. We primarily receive fees on a participation basis. Our participation\ncontracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and other\npromotional costs and any relevant regulatory levies) from Virtual Sports content placed on our customers’ websites or in our customers’ facilities. Typically, we recognize revenue\nfrom these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract.\nRevenue growth for our Virtual Sports segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the net win performance of the games and the net win percentage that we\nreceive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.\nVirtual Sports, Key Performance Indicators\nFor the Three-Month For the Nine-Month\nPeriod ended Variance Period ended Variance\nSeptember September September September\n30, 30, 2024 vs 2023 30, 30, 2024 vs 2023\n2024 2023 % 2024 2023 %\nVirtuals\nNo. of Live Customers at the end of the period 57 58 (1) (1.7)% 57 58 (1) (1.7)%\nAverage No. of Live Customers 56 58 (2) (3.4)% 56 58 (2) (3.4)%\nTotal Revenue (£’m) £ 8.6 £ 10.6 £ (2.0) (18.9)% £ 27.7 £ 34.9 £ (7.2) (20.6)%\nTotal Revenue £’m - Retail £ 2.3 £ 2.4 £ (0.1) (4.2)% £ 7.1 £ 7.6 £ (0.5) (6.6)%\nTotal Revenue £’m - Online Virtuals £ 6.3 £ 8.2 £ (1.9) (23.2)% £ 20.6 £ 27.3 £ (6.7) (24.5)%\nIn the table above:\n“No. of Live Customers at the end of the period” and “Average No. of Live Customers” represent the number of customers from which there is Virtual Sports revenue at the end of\nthe period and the average number of customers from which there is Virtual Sports revenue during the period, respectively.\n“Total Revenue (£m)” represents total revenue for the Virtual Sports segment, including recurring and upfront service revenue.

This increase was primarily driven by the\nincrease in gross margin, partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses, driven by increased IT costs, lower labor capitalization and higher depreciation and amortization.\n30\nLeisure\nWe typically generate revenue from our Leisure segment through the supply of our gaming and amusement machines. We receive rental fees for machines, typically on a long-term\ncontract basis, on both a participation and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are usually structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator\ncustomers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays, any relevant regulatory levies and minimum fixed incomes where applicable) from machines placed in our customers’\nfacilities. We generally recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract.\nRevenue growth for our Leisure segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the number of machines in operation, the net win performance of the machines and\nthe net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.\nLeisure, Key Performance Indicators\nFor the Three-Month For the Nine-Month\nPeriod ended Variance Period ended Variance\nSeptember September September September\n30, 30, 2024 vs 2023 30, 30, 2024 vs 2023\n2024 2023 % 2024 2023 %\nLeisure\nEnd of period installed base Gaming machines (#\nof terminals) 10,021 10,739 (718) (6.7)% 10,021 10,739 (718) (6.7)%\nAverage installed base Gaming machines (# of\nterminals) 10,131 10,757 (626) (5.8)% 10,469 10,763 (294) (2.7)%\nEnd of period installed base Other (# of\nterminals) 3,796 4,303 (507) (11.8)% 3,796 4,303 (507) (11.8)%\nAverage installed base Other (# of terminals) 3,813 4,327 (514) (11.9)% 3,969 4,409 (440) (10.0)%\nPub Digital Gaming Machines - Average\ninstalled base (# of terminals) 6,129 6,239 (110) (1.8)% 6,230 6,128 102 1.7%\nPub Analogue Gaming Machines - Average\ninstalled base (# of terminals) 111 318 (207) (65.1)% 134 413 (279) (67.6)%\nMSA and Bingo Gaming Machines - Average\ninstalled base (# of terminals)(1) 2,865 3,037 (172) (5.7)% 2,978 3,046 (68) (2.2)%\nInspired Leisure Revenue per Gaming Machine\nper week £ 74.5 £ 67.8 £ 6.7 9.9% £ 71.4 £ 67.2 £ 4.2 6.3%\nInspired Pub Digital Revenue per Gaming\nMachine per week £ 74.4 £ 68.9 £ 5.5 8.0% £ 73.7 £ 69.9 £ 3.8 5.4%\nInspired Pub Analogue Revenue per Gaming\nMachine per week £ 30.7 £ 31.9 £ (1.2) (3.8)% £ 31.6 £ 35.7 £ (4.1) (11.5)%\nInspired MSA and Bingo Revenue per Gaming\nMachine per week £ 103.4 £ 90.7 £ 12.7 14.0% £ 96.5 £ 92.8 £ 3.7 4.0%\nInspired Other Revenue per Machine per week £ 25.0 £ 23.7 £ 1.3 5.5% £ 24.2 £ 21.1 £ 3.1 14.7%\nTotal Holiday Parks Revenue (Gaming and Non\nGaming) (£’m) £ 13.9 £ 13.8 £ 0.1 0.7% £ 27.5 £ 26.5 £ 1.0 3.8%\n(1) Motorway Service Area machines\n31\nIn the table above:\n“End of period installed base Gaming” and “Average installed base Gaming” represent the number of gaming machines installed (excluding Holiday Park machines) that are\nCategory B and Category C only (UK Gambling Act 2005 places machines into categories dependent on maximum stake and prize available), from which there is participation or\nrental revenue at the end of the period or as an average over the period.\n“End of period installed base Other” and “Average installed base Other” represent the number of all other category machines installed (excluding Holiday Park machines) from\nwhich there is participation or rental revenue at the end of the period or as an average over the period.\n“Revenue per machine unit per week” represents the average weekly participation or rental revenue recognized during the period.\nLeisure, Results of Operations\nAll amounts included herein relating to the prior year have been rounded except where otherwise stated.

These increases were primarily due to\nincreased service revenue of $ 0.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, predominately due to the increase in Holiday Parks of $0.2 million and $1.3 million driven by the addition of\na new site as well as growth in existing sites, along with growth in MSA of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nLeisure Operating Income\nOperating income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. This was primarily due to the increases in\ngross margin, partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses of $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, driven by the increase in seasonal staff, the increase in national living wage\nand salary increases, along with increases in facility costs.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, to analyze our operating performance. We use these financial measures to manage our business on a day-to-day\nbasis. We believe that these measures are also commonly used in our industry to measure performance. For these reasons, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide\nexpanded insight into our business, in addition to standard U.S. GAAP financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for defining and using non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, and as a result the measures we use may not be comparable to measures used by other companies, even if they have similar labels. The presentation of non-GAAP financial\ninformation should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should\nconsider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense, and other additional exclusions\nand adjustments (see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table). Such additional excluded amounts include stock-based compensation U.S. GAAP charges where the associated liability is\nexpected to be settled in stock, and changes in the value of earnout liabilities and income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where\ntrading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the normal course of business, including but\nnot limited to (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance, impairments, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to\nfacility closures and integration costs, (2) merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a particularly useful performance measure, because it focuses on certain operating drivers\nof the business, including sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can provide a more\ncomplete understanding of our operating results and the trends to which we are subject, and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the\nfuture. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss, because it does not take into\naccount certain aspects of our operating performance (for example, it excludes non-recurring gains and losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of underlying business\nactivities). Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the use by other companies of similarly termed measures. Management compensates for these limitations by using\nAdjusted EBITDA as only one of several measures for evaluating our operating performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which affect depreciation and amortization, interest\nexpense, and income tax benefit (expense), are evaluated separately by management.\n33\nAdjusted Revenue (Revenue Excluding Low Margin Gaming Hardware Sales) is defined as revenue excluding Gaming hardware sales that are sold at Low Margin with the intention\nof securing longer term recurring revenue streams.\nFunctional Currency at Constant rate. Currency impacts discussed have been calculated as the current-period average GBP: USD rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior\nperiod, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the\ndifference in our functional currency, multiplied by the prior-period average GBP: USD rate, as a proxy for functional currency at constant rate movement.\nCurrency Movement represents the difference between the results in our reporting currency (USD) and the results on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis.\nReconciliations from net loss, as shown in our Consolidates Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), to Adjusted EBITDA are shown below:\nReconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the Three and Nine-Months ended September 30, 2024\nFor the Three-Month Period ended For the Nine-Month Period ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions) 2024 2024\nVirtual Virtual\nTotal Gaming Sports Interactive Leisure Corporate Total Gaming Sports Interactive Leisure Corporate\nNet Income/ (loss) $ 3.4 $ 4.4 $ 7.4 $ 5.5 $ 6.9 $ (20.8) $(0.3) $ 13.6 $ 23.8 $ 13.4 $ 8.6 $ (59.7)\nItems Relating to Legacy Activities:\nPension charges (1) 0.3 0.3 0.9 0.9\nItems outside the normal course of business:\nCosts of group restructure (2) 1.9 1.2 0.7 2.8 1.5 1.3\nCosts of group restatement (3) 2.9 2.9 10.7 10.7\nStock-based compensation expense (4) 1.8 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.3 5.7 0.5 0.3 0.3 0.4 4.2\nDepreciation and amortization (4) 11.3 5.0 1.3 1.3 3.1 0.6 31.8 12.7 4.7 3.7 9.1 1.6\nInterest expense net (4) 7.6 7.6 20.9 20.9\nOther finance expenses / (income) (4) (0.1) (0.1) (0.3) (0.3)\nIncome tax (4) 1.0 1.0 (0.4) (0.4)\nAdjusted EBITDA $30.1 $ 10.7 $ 8.8 $ 6.9 $ 10.2 $ (6.5) $71.8 $ 28.3 $ 28.8 $ 17.4 $ 18.1 $ (20.8)\nAdjusted EBITDA £23.1 £ 8.1 £ 6.8 £ 5.3 £ 7.9 £ (5.0) £56.0 £ 21.7 £ 22.4 £ 13.4 £ 14.1 £ (15.6)\nExchange Rate - $ to £ (5) 1.30 1.28\nNote: Certain corporate function costs have not been allocated to the Company’s reportable operating segments because to do so would not be practical; these are shown in the\nCorporate category.\n34\nReconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the Three and Nine-Months ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Three-Month Period ended For the Nine-Month Period ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions) 2023 2023\nVirtual Virtual\nTotal Gaming Sports Interactive Leisure Corporate Total Gaming Sports Interactive Leisure Corporate\nNet Income/ (loss) $ 3.4 $ 2.8 $ 10.8 $ 3.7 $ 5.5 $ (19.4) $ 7.6 $ 13.9 $ 34.6 $ 8.5 $ 6.3 $ (55.7)\nItems Relating to Legacy Activities:\nPension charges (1) 0.2 0.2 0.6 0.6\nItems outside the normal course of business:\nCost of Group Restructure (2) 0.7 0.7 3.7 3.7\nStock-based compensation expense (4) 3.3 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.2 2.4 9.3 1.1 0.6 0.4 0.7 6.5\nDepreciation and amortization (4) 10.3 5.1 0.7 0.9 3.0 0.6 29.8 14.2 2.3 2.5 9.1 1.7\nInterest expense net (4) 6.9 6.9 20.5 20.5\nOther finance expenses / (income) (4) (0.1) (0.1) (0.3) (0.3)\nIncome tax (4) 2.0 2.0 2.8 2.8\nAdjusted EBITDA $26.7 $ 8.3 $ 11.7 $ 4.7 $ 8.7 $ (6.7) $74.0 $ 29.2 $ 37.5 $ 11.4 $ 16.1 $ (20.2)\nAdjusted EBITDA £21.1 £ 6.8 £ 9.2 £ 3.7 £ 6.7 £ (5.3) £59.4 £ 23.7 £ 30.1 £ 9.1 £ 12.6 £ (16.1)\nExchange Rate - $ to £ (5) 1.27 1.24\nNote: Certain corporate function costs have not been allocated to the Company’s reportable operating segments because to do so would not be practical; these are shown in the\nCorporate category.\nNotes to Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation tables above:\n(1) “Pension charges” are profit and loss charges included within selling, general and administrative expenses, relating to a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new entrants\nin 1999 and to future accrual in 2010.

The decrease was driven primarily due to trading levels and working capital\ntiming.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities and stock-based compensation expense decreased by $4.1 million to $5.7 million due to a $3.6 million reduction in the stock-based\ncompensation expense and a $0.5 million reduction in the recycling of the terminated currency swaps which ended on September 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $2.5 million, to $35.1 million, with increases of $1.4 million for intangible assets and $1.1 million for contract costs.\nOther net cash utilized by operating activities increased by $8.4 million, to a $16.4 million outflow. The relative movements between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in adverse movements in accounts payable and accruals of $12.5 million and accounts receivable of $16.1 million, both figures\nimpacted by timing of deals and the relative levels of manufacturing activity. These were partly offset by favorable movements in inventory $11.7 million, payroll and business taxes\n$5.5 million and prepayments $2.0 million.\n36\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash utilized in investing activities decreased by $9.9 million, to $29.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was driven by an $8.4 million decrease in\nplant, property and equipment, a $1.9 million decrease in capitalized software spend and a $0.9 million increase in contract cost additions. The prior period also included the\nacquisition of Lot.to for $0.6 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing activities was $0.4 million relating to finance lease spend. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, net cash utilized by financing activities was $2.6 million, with $1.0 million of finance lease spend and $1.6 million on share repurchases.\nFunding Needs and Sources\nTo fund our obligations, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations and the incurrence of additional debt or the refinancing of existing debt. As\nof September 30, 2024, we had liquidity consisting of $36.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and a further $6.7 million of undrawn revolver facility. This compares to $26.4\nmillion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023, with a further $24.4 million of revolver facilities undrawn. We had a working capital outflow of $16.4 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an $8.0 million outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe level of our working capital surplus or deficit varies with the level of machine production and procurement we are undertaking and our capitalization as well as the seasonality\nevident in some of the businesses. In periods with minimal machine volumes and capital spend, our working capital is typically more stable. In periods where significant numbers of\nmachines are being produced or procured, the levels of inventory and creditors are typically higher and there is a natural timing difference between converting the stock into sellable or\ncapitalized plant and settling payments to suppliers. These factors, along with movements in trading activity levels can result in significant working capital volatility. In periods of low\nactivity, our working capital volatility is reduced. Working capital is reviewed and managed with the aim of ensuring that current liabilities are covered by the level of cash held and the\nexpected level of short-term receipts.\nSome of our business operations require cash to be held within the machines. As of September 30, 2024, $6.7 million of our $36.5 million of cash and cash equivalents were held as\noperational floats within the machines. At September 30, 2023, $6.0 million of our $26.4 million of cash and cash equivalents were held as operational floats within the machines\nManagement currently believes that the Company’s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, and the ability to control and defer capital projects\nwill be sufficient to fund the Company’s net cash requirements through November 2025.\nLong Term and Other Debt\n(In millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash held £ 26.6 $ 35.7 £ 21.6 $ 26.4\nRevolver drawn (15.0) (20.1) - -\nOriginal principal senior debt (235.0) (315.2) (235.0) (286.9)\nCash interest accrued (6.6) (8.9) (6.1) (7.5)\nFinance lease creditors (18.2) (24.4) (2.0) (2.5)\nTotal £ (248.2) $ (332.9) £ (221.5) $ (270.4)\nDebt Covenants\nUnder our debt facilities in place as of September 30, 2024, we are not subject to covenant testing on the Senior Secured Notes. We are, however, subject to covenant testing at the\nlevel of Inspired Entertainment Inc., the ultimate holding company, on our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility which requires the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated\nsenior secured net leverage ratio of 6.0x on March 31, 2022, stepping down to 5.75x on March 31, 2023 and 5.50x from March 31, 2024 and thereafter (the “RCF Financial\nCovenant”). The RCF Financial Covenant is calculated as the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (defined as net loss excluding\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense) for the 12-month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly\non a rolling basis, subject to the Initial Facility (as defined in the RCF Agreement) being drawn on the relevant test date. The RCF Financial Covenant does not include a minimum\ninterest coverage ratio or other financial covenants. Covenant testing at September 30, 2024 showed covenant compliance with a net leverage of 3.1x.\nThe Indenture contains covenants and certain reporting requirements including the requirement to provide the Lender, within 60 days after the close of the quarter, unaudited quarterly\nfinancial statements with footnote disclosures. The Company was unable to comply with this requirement as of September 30, 2023 due to the requirement to restate previously\nreported financial statements as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2023. The debt agreement allows the Company a 30-day grace period to\nprovide such financial information once they receive any notice of non-compliance. No such notice was received and concurrent with the filing of the September 30,2023 10Q with the\nSEC on February 27, 2024, the reporting requirement was met. There were no other breaches of the debt covenants in the periods.\nThere were no other breaches of the debt covenants in the periods ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\n37\nLiens and Encumbrances\nAs of September 30, 2024, our senior bank debt was secured by the imposition of a fixed and floating charge in favor of the lender over all the assets of the Company and certain of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Board of Directors has authorized that the Company may use up to $25.0 million to repurchase Inspired shares of common stock, subject to repurchases being effected on or\nbefore May 10, 2025. Management has discretion as to whether to repurchase shares of the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 no shares were repurchased\nmeaning the previous figure of an aggregate total spend of $12.0 million in repurchasing our shares of common stock remains unchanged.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nLess than More than\nContractual Obligations (in millions) Total 1 yr 1-2 years 3-5 years 5 yrs\nOperating activities\nInterest on long term debt $ 49.6 $ 24.8 $ 24.8 $ - $ -\nPurchase of Vantage machines 6.2 6.2 - - -\nFinancing activities\nRevolver repayment 21.1 21.1 - - -\nSenior bank debt - principal repayment 315.2 - 315.2 - -\nFinance lease payments 24.4 7.8 4.8 11.8 -\nOperating lease payments 18.7 5.3 4.5 5.1 3.8\nInterest on non-utilisation fees 0.4 0.3 0.1 - -\nTotal $ 435.6 $ 65.5 $ 349.4 $ 16.9 $ 3.8\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We exercise considerable\njudgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition\nof revenue and expenses, and our disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates\nand judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors, including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and current and expected\neconomic conditions, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when\ncircumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound\naccounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could\ndiffer from such estimates.\n38\nRevenue\nApplication of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with\nnonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. The Company often enters into contracts with customers that\nconsist of a combination of services and products that are accounted for as one or more distinct performance obligations. Management applies judgment in evaluating the contractual\nterms and conditions that impact the identification of performance obligations and the pattern of revenue recognition. For these arrangements that contain multiple promises,\njudgement is also required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when\nwe do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions, size of the customer, geography and other observable\ninputs or, as necessary, unobservable considerations such as historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and our current or expected selling practices.\nRevenue recognition is also impacted by our ability to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, service-level penalties, and other incentive payments.\nWe consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are\nconducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates.\nOther significant judgments include determining whether the Company is acting as the principal or the agent in a transaction.\nThe Company recognized service and product revenue of $196.7 million and $20.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s\nrevenue recognition policy, which requires significant judgments and estimates, is fully described in Note 1 “Nature of Operations, Management’s Plans and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business\ncombination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill upon reorganization using a relative fair value allocation approach. We\ndetermined that we have five reporting units: Virtual Sports, Interactive, Leisure, and two reporting units within our Gaming segment. As of September 30, 2024, total goodwill with\nthe Virtual Sports, Interactive, and two Gaming reporting units is $47.1 million, $1.9 million, $9.8 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. There is no remaining goodwill within the\nLeisure reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) annually on the last day of our fiscal\nperiod or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These\nevents or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant\nportion of a reporting unit.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process. If we perform a qualitative assessment and determine that the\nfair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative test, we are\nrequired to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the\nrespective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is\nhigher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s estimated fair value.\n39\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units,\nassignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Performance of the qualitative goodwill assessment requires judgment in\nidentifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of the reporting units. Such events and\ncircumstances that we have considered include macroeconomic conditions, industry specific and market considerations, and reporting unit-specific factors such as overall actual and\nprojected financial performance, among other factors. We also considered the results from the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed as a part of a quantitative\ngoodwill assessment and specifically the cushion between each reporting unit’s fair value and carrying value. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit as a part\nof a quantitative goodwill assessment change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could\nmaterially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 using a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units. Based on the results of our\nqualitative impairment assessments, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying\nvalues and there were no reporting units requiring further assessment.\nLong-lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated\nundiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets are not recoverable. If the asset group fails the\nrecoverability test, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant judgment is required to\nestimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets\nand other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in\nkey assumptions (i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or expectation that, more likely than not, an asset or asset group will be\nsold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life) or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our\nestimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements. Any impairment loss shall be allocated to the long-lived assets of\nthe group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying\namount of that asset below its fair value.\nManagement determined that there were no new indicators of impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the Company concluded that there was\nno impairment of the Company’s intangible and long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs represent costs incurred to develop internal-use software, including software developed to deliver our cloud-based offerings to customers, as well\nas external-use software to be used in the products we sell, lease or license to customers. Such costs primarily consist of salaries and payroll related costs for employees and external\ncontractors directly involved in the corresponding software development efforts. We determine the appropriate guidance to apply to software development costs on a project-by-project\nbasis, based on the nature of the underlying software.\n40\nCertain direct costs incurred to develop new internal-use software, as well as certain software enhancements that provide new functionality, are capitalized once the project\nhas been approved by management and is in the application development stage.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary planning stage and the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in developing external-use software\nare expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, after which costs are capitalized up to the date the software is available for general release to customers.\nTechnological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, upon completion of a working model.\nThe Company must apply judgement in determining the amount of software development costs that should be capitalized. Specifically, we must evaluate, on a project-by-\nproject basis, whether the resultant product or platform will be completed and generate ongoing economic benefits, principally through revenue from our customers, which is subject to\nuncertainties.\nOnce the software is substantially complete or available for general release, capitalized internal-use and external-use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated economic useful life of the software, which ranges from two to five years. There is judgement involved in estimating the useful life of developed software and the two-to-\nfive-year period was determined based on factors such as the continuous development in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant\nupgrades. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a recurring basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the\nrecoverability of these assets.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur principal market risks are our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nFollowing the Company’s refinancing of its debt in May 2021, the external borrowings of £235.0 million ($315.2 million) are provided at a fixed rate. Therefore, movements in rates\nsuch as LIBOR do not impact on the current borrowings and the only fluctuation that is expected to be reported will be that solely caused by movements in the exchange rates between\nthe Company’s functional currency and its reporting currency.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur operations are conducted in various countries around the world, and we receive revenue and pay expenses from these operations in a number of different currencies. As such, our\nearnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in (i) currencies other than GBP, which is our functional currency, or (ii) the\nfunctional currencies of our subsidiaries, which is not necessarily GBP. To estimate our foreign currency exchange rate risk, we identify material Euro and US Dollar trading and\nbalance sheet amounts and recalculate the result using a 10% movement in the GBP:US Dollar exchange rate. For the trading figures the 10% movement is based on the average\nexchange rate throughout the reported period and for the balance sheet figures the 10% movement is based on the exchange rate used at September 30, 2024.\nExcluding intercompany balances, our Euro and US Dollar functional currency net assets total approximately $25.7 million and $13.0 million respectively. We use a sensitivity\nanalysis model to measure the impact of a 10% adverse movement of foreign currency exchange rates against the US Dollar. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the\nEuro and the US Dollar relative to GBP as of September 30, 2024, would result in favorable translation adjustments of approximately $2.3 million and $1.3 million respectively,\nrecorded in other comprehensive loss.\nIncluded within our trading results are earnings outside of our functional currency. Retained gains from Euro based entities earned in Euros and retained losses from USD based\nentities earned in US Dollars in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were €9.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the\nEuro and the US Dollar relative to GBP as of September 30, 2024, would result in translation adjustments of approximately $0.9 million favorable and $1.3 million unfavorable,\nrespectively, recorded in trading operations.\n41\nThe majority of the Company’s trading is in GBP, the functional currency, although the reporting currency of the Company is the US Dollar. As such, changes in the GBP:USD\nexchange rate have an effect on the Company’s results. A 10% weakening of GBP against the US Dollar would change the trading operational results unfavorably by approximately\n$0.3 million and would result in unfavorable translation adjustments of approximately $11.9 million, recorded in other comprehensive loss.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer (together, the “Certifying Officers”),\nwe carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30,\n2024, due to the material weaknesses described in Item 9A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15,\n2024. Management is redesigning and implementing existing and additional controls to remediate these material weaknesses.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weaknesses and management’s assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, management believes that the interim consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in\nall material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures as of and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the control changes to remediate the identified material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n42\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThere are no new legal proceedings, or new updates to prior disclosures to report.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects,\nand cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause investors in our common stock to lose all or part of their investments.\n43\nITEM 2.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our business strategy,\nplans and objectives and our expected or contemplated future operations, results, financial condition, beliefs and intentions. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations or predictions of future\nevents or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions on which such statements are expressly or implicitly based, areforward-looking statements. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “can”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”,\n“intend”, “may”, “might”, “plan”, “possible”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”, “scheduled”, “seek”, “should”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions, among others, and negative expressions including such words, may identify forward-looking\nstatements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations about our future results, performance, liquidity, financial condition, prospects and opportunities, and are based upon information currently available to us, our\ninterpretation of what we believe to be significant factors affecting our business and many assumptions regarding future events.Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition, prospects and opportunities could differ materially from\nthose expressed in, or implied by, our forward-looking statements. This could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including the following: our ability to compete effectively in our industries;the effect of evolving technology on\nour business;our ability to renew long-term contracts and retain customers, and secure new contracts and customers;our ability to maintain relationships with suppliers;our ability to protect our intellectual property;our ability to protect our\nbusiness against cybersecurity threats; our ability to successfully grow by acquisition as well as organically; government regulation of our industries;fluctuations due to seasonality; our ability to attract and retain key members of our\nmanagement team;our need for working capital;our ability to secure capital for growth and expansion;changing consumer, technology and other trends in our industries;our ability to successfully operate across multiple jurisdictions and\nmarkets around the world; changes in local, regional and global economic and political conditions;our ability to effectively integrate the operations of businesses we acquire, and to grow and expand such operations; and otherfactors\ndescribed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which are available, free of charge, on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In\nlight of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that any matters covered by our forward-looking statements will develop as predicted, expected or implied. Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or reviseany forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or\nany other reason. We advise you to carefully review the reports and documents we file from time to time with the SEC.\nThe information contained in this presentation is qualified in its entirety by the information contained in our Quarterly Reporton Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC.\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAll years represented in this presentation are fiscal years unless otherwise indicated. All information presented for quarterly periods is unaudited.\nThis presentation contains certain historical and pro forma financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance withUnited States generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”). A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined\nas a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flow of the company. These measures are presented as supplemental disclosures because we use such measures to analyze our operating\nperformance and because certain of the measures are widely used measures of performance in our industry. See the Appendix fora reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA is\ndefined as earnings before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA to remove the effects of certain stock-based compensation charges, certain changes related to\nlegacy portions of the business and items considered outside the normal course of business, including restructuring costs, merger and acquisition costs and gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business. Adjusted Revenue (also\nRevenue Excluding Low Margin Gaming Hardware Sales) is defined as revenue excluding hardware sales that are sold at low margin with the intention of securing longer term recurring revenue streams. The disclosure of EBITDA, Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted Revenue and other non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in isolation\nfrom, as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, operating income, cash flows, revenue, and other measures of financialperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our results are translated from the British pound (GBP), our\nfunctional currency, into US dollars (USD), our reporting currency. In order to isolate the effect of translation exchange rate differences between periods, we also present results on a Constant Currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure that assumes a constant translation exchange rate between periods. The currency impact has been calculated as the current period GBP:USD rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior period, multiplied by the current period\namount in the functional currency (GBP). The remaining difference, referred to as Constant Currency, is calculated as the difference in the functional currency, multiplied by the prior period average GBP:USD rate, as a proxy for Constant\nCurrency movement.
