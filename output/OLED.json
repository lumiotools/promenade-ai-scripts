The rate of growth this year, though, is expected to be more modest than previously projected. With recent updates to customer order expectations for the fourth quarter, we are lowering our 2024 revenue forecast range to $625 million to $645 million,” said Brian Millard, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Universal Display Corporation. “We believe that 2024 marks the start of a new OLED adoption cycle for medium-sized displays, namely IT and automotive. With leading tablet, notebook, monitor, as well as auto OEMs expected to broaden their product roadmaps for OLEDs, significant investments in new OLED facilities are being deployed for these nascent market segments. As a leader in the OLED ecosystem, we are enabling and supporting this long runway of growth. Our world-class technology continues to set industry standards, our global partnerships continue to expand and deepen, and we continue to leverage our unparalleled expertise.” \n\n** Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2024 **\n\n  * Total revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $161.6 million as compared to $141.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Revenue from material sales was $83.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $92.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in material sales was primarily due to changes in customer mix as material volumes were relatively flat between periods. \n  * Revenue from royalty and license fees was $74.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $45.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of changes in customer mix and a $6.8 million increase in cumulative catch-up adjustment between periods. \n  * Cost of material sales was $33.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $31.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in cost of material sales was primarily due to product mix. \n  * Total gross margin was 78% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 76% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Operating income was $67.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $48.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * The effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 4.4% in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The relatively low effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the change in IRS regulations, issued in July 2023, that permitted withholding taxes to be credited against U.S. taxable income for the taxable years 2022 and 2023. \n  * Net income was $66.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $51.5 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n** Revenue Comparison **\n\n**($ in thousands)** |  **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nMaterial sales  |  $  |  83,428  |  $  |  92,492   \nRoyalty and license fees  |  74,590  |  45,915   \nContract research services  |  3,609  |  2,670   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  161,627  |  $  |  141,077   \n  \n** Cost of Materials Comparison **\n\n**($ in thousands)** |  **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nMaterial sales  |  $  |  83,428  |  $  |  92,492   \nCost of material sales  |  33,172  |  31,639   \nGross margin on material sales  |  50,256  |  60,853   \nGross margin as a % of material sales  |  60  |  %  |  66  |  %   \n  \n** Financial Highlights for the First Nine Months of 2024 **\n\n  * Total revenue in the first nine months of 2024 was $485.4 million as compared to $418.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n  * Revenue from material sales was $272.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $239.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in material sales was primarily due to strengthened demand for our emitter materials, partially offset by changes in customer mix. \n  * Revenue from royalty and license fees was $202.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $165.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of higher unit material volume and changes in customer mix during the third quarter of 2024. \n  * Cost of material sales was $102.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $89.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to an increase in materials sales volume and product mix, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in inventory reserve expense. \n  * Total gross margin was 77% in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 76% in the first nine months of 2023. \n  * Operating income was $186.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $152.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n  * The effective income tax rate was 18.8% and 16.8% in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Net income was $176.1 million or $3.69 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $141.0 million or $2.95 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2023. \n\n\n\n** Revenue Comparison **\n\n**($ in thousands)** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nMaterial sales  |  $  |  272,154  |  $  |  239,789   \nRoyalty and license fees  |  202,409  |  165,524   \nContract research services  |  10,828  |  12,796   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  485,391  |  $  |  418,109   \n  \n** Cost of Materials Comparison **\n\n**($ in thousands)** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nMaterial sales  |  $  |  272,154  |  $  |  239,789   \nCost of material sales  |  102,759  |  89,697   \nGross margin on material sales  |  169,395  |  150,092   \nGross margin as a % of material sales  |  62  |  %  |  63  |  %   \n  \n** 2024 Revised Guidance **\n\nThe Company now believes that its 2024 revenue will be in the range of $625 million to $645 million. The OLED industry remains at a stage where many variables can have a material impact on results, and the Company thus caveats its financial guidance accordingly. \n\n** Dividend **\n\nThe Company also announced a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.40 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024. \n\n** Conference Call Information **\n\nIn conjunction with this release, Universal Display will host a conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

BUSINESS:\nUniversal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting\ndiode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state\ndevices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting\nproducts. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and\npersonal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential\nadvantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and\nmanufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of\ntheir high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual\nproperty position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that\nshould enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance.\nThe Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products\nfor display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and\nautomotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s\nproprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of\nproprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as\nwell as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing\npartnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 6,000 patents issued and pending worldwide.\nThe Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company\nalso enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s\npatents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the\nCompany's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nInterim Financial Information\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments)\nnecessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. While management believes that the disclosures presented are\nadequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults of operations for any other interim period or for the full year.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland\nLimited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display\nCorporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED\nMaterial Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\n7\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior year adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities have been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements\nof Cash Flows to conform to the current year presentation. Stock-based compensation activity has been consolidated and includes stock-based compensation to\nemployees, Board of Directors, and Scientific Advisory Board.\nCertain prior year adjustments have been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity to conform to the current year presentation.\nStock-based compensation and ESPP activity, net of taxes withheld has been consolidated and includes issuance of common stock to employees, shares withheld\nfor employee taxes, issuance of common stock to Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board, cancellation of restricted stock units and issuance of\ncommon stock to employees under an ESPP.\nManagement’s Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including\nestimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories,\nintangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nInventories\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net\nrealizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be\nobsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s\nanalyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future\ndemand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing\nforecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from\ncustomers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been\nwritten down may be sold.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying\nConsolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents\nand investments (excluding minority equity investments) are carried at fair value.\nMinority Equity Investments\nThe Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without\nreadily determinable fair values. The value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies\nis not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when evidence of an impairment exists. Factors\nconsidered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity\nfinancing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the\ncommencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity\nstakeholders. The impairment in the value of minority equity investments is included in the other loss, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeases\nThe Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and\nadministrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and\nlease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is\n8\ninitially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease\nright-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other\ncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements.\nKey estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the\nlease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nMaterial sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED\ndevelopment and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of\nshipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material\npasses in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials\nprior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such\ncircumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer\nwill exercise its right of return.\nThe vast majority of revenue attributed to material sales is determined through technology license agreements and material supply agreements the terms of\nwhich are jointly agreed upon with the Company’s customers. The remaining revenue recognized is in the form of contract research services revenue earned by\nthe Company’s subsidiary, Adesis, Inc., and the Company’s occasional material sales to smaller customers. None of the revenue recognized during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted solely from royalty or license fee arrangements as to which there were not associated material sales.\nThe rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply\nagreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting\npurposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the\ncontract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and\nroyalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing.\nVarious estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract\nterm based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee.\nAdditionally, management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term.\nContract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization\nfor non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and\nbuilding blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services\nare provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is\nrecognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of\nrevenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these\ncases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to\ncontractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable.\nTechnology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization\nassistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOn December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous\nlicense agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective\nas of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid\na license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use\ncertain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets.\n9\nAt the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental\nmaterial purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material\npurchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees\nto purchase red and green phosphorescent emitter materials from the Company for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This amount purchased is subject\nto SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement.\nIn 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG\nDisplay), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025.\nThe patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent\nportfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement\nprovides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other\nminimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue.\nIn 2023, the Company entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the\nCompany has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display\nproducts. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products.\nIn 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display\nTechnology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has\ngranted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The\nCompany also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products.\nIn 2024, the Company entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under these agreements, the\nCompany has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display\nproducts. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products.\nIn 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd.\n(Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the\nCompany to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally,\nthe Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent\nlicense and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term.\nAll material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S.\ndollars.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the facilities of the Company's manufacturing\npartner, PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) and at the Company's internal facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing\nequipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory.\nResearch and Development\nExpenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred.\nPatent Costs\nCosts associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to\nsuccessfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful\noutcome are charged to expense.\n10\nAmortization of Acquired Technology\nAmortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA) and BASF SE (BASF). The Merck\nKGaA acquisition was completed on April 28, 2023 and the BASF acquisition was completed during the year ended December 31, 2016. Acquisition costs are\nbeing amortized over a period of 10 years for the Merck KGaA and BASF patents.\nAmortization of Other Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar\nand the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its respective local currency. The\nCompany translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at\nweighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's\nOMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at\nthe actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and\nforeign currency transactions to date has been insignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and\ntax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in\nthe period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being\nsustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition\nor measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized\ntax benefits as a component of tax expense.\nShare-Based Payment Awards\nThe Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee\nstock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors.\nThe grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized\nas compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant,\nexercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable.\nPerformance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date\nfair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that\nthe applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation\nexpense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions. Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair\nvalue. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to\n11\ncontractual restrictions. The adoption of ASU 2022-03, beginning on January 1, 2024, did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and\nrelated disclosures.\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The standard\nimproves the reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company does not\nexpect ASU 2023-07, which becomes effective during the annual period ending December 31, 2024, to have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements\nand related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The standard enhances to the annual\nincome tax disclosures to address investor requests for more information about the tax risks and opportunities present in an entity's worldwide operations. ASU\n2023-09 becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its\nincome tax disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The standard provides guidance to reduce\ncomplexity and diversity in practice in determining whether a profits interest award is accounted for as a share-based payment. Early adoption is permitted. This\nguidance can be applied either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements or prospectively to profits interest or similar awards\ngranted or modified on or after the effective date for our application of this guidance. The Company does not expect ASU 2024-01, which becomes effective\nJanuary 1, 2025, to have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\n3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS:\nThe Company’s portfolio of marketable fixed income securities consists of U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all\nhighly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\nclassifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses\nreported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands):\nCost or Unrealized Aggregate Fair\nCash and Cash Equivalents Classification Amortized Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCash accounts in banking institutions $ 78,291 $ — $ — $ 78,291\nMoney market accounts 1,268 — — 1,268\n$ 79,559 $ — $ — $ 79,559\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash accounts in banking institutions $ 91,717 $ — $ — $ 91,717\nMoney market accounts 268 — — 268\n$ 91,985 $ — $ — $ 91,985\n12\nShort-term Investments\nThe following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands):\nCost or Unrealized Aggregate Fair\nShort-term Investments Classification Amortized Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S. Government bonds $ 470,797 $ 1,106 $ (41) $ 471,862\nMarketable securities (1) 123 — — 131\n$ 470,920 $ 1,106 $ (41) $ 471,993\nDecember 31, 2023\nCorporate bonds $ 1,763 $ 1 $ (5) $ 1,759\nU.S. Government bonds 420,769 303 (694) 420,378\n$ 422,532 $ 304 $ (699) $ 422,137\n(1) Changes in aggregate fair market value recorded in other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLong-term U.S. Government Bond Investments\nThe following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of long-term investments (in thousands):\nCost or Unrealized Aggregate Fair\nLong-term Investments Classification Amortized Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S. Government bonds $ 374,706 $ 4,136 $ (31) $ 378,811\n$ 374,706 $ 4,136 $ (31) $ 378,811\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Government bonds $ 284,053 $ 1,457 $ (8) $ 285,502\n$ 284,053 $ 1,457 $ (8) $ 285,502\nMinority Equity Investments\nThe Company’s portfolio of minority equity investments consists of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated for the\nCompany to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company typically does not seek to obtain representation on the boards of\ndirectors of the companies in which it invests. Minority equity investments are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had minority equity investments in six and five entities, respectively, with a total carrying value of $18.1 million and\n$14.0 million, respectively, accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values.\n4.

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the\nfull term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nChanges in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other loss, net\non the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n5.

The term of the New OLED Materials\nAgreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless\nterminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials\nAgreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement,\nPPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and\nfor resale to its customers.\nUnder the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter.\nThe Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50% of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash\nor shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based\non the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on\nMarch 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $20.00, the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have\nbeen issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract.\nThe Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw\nmaterials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts.\nIn February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying\noperation and maintenance services to be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited (PPG SCM), to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s manufacturing\nsite in Shannon, Ireland that UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM), began leasing at such time for the\nproduction of OLED materials. OMM purchased the site in September 2023 and the Company amended and restated the February 2021 amendment to reflect\nOMM’s ownership and PPG SCM’s updated operation and maintenance services after such purchase. Facility improvements have been completed and operations\ncommenced in June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at\nthe Shannon manufacturing facility.\nThe Company recorded research and development expense of $4.6 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $12.5 million and $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the\nreimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals.\n14.

Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years\nfrom the grant date. The total number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Equity Compensation Plan is equal to the shares that were available for\nissuance and not subject to an award under the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan at the time it was replaced by the Equity Compensation Plan, subject to\nadjustment with respect to shares underlying any outstanding award granted under the Equity Compensation Plan or the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan that may\nexpire, or be terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason, without issuance of such shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,359,167 shares that\nremained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan will terminate on June 15, 2033.\nRestricted Stock Awards and Units\nThe Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is\nequal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees. Consistent with the accounting for equity-\nclassified awards issued to employees, our equity-classified nonemployee share-based awards are measured at the grant date fair value. Expense for restricted\nstock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued\nto non-employees.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 86,454 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees\nand non-employees, which had a total fair value of $14.3 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant,\nprovided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units\ngranted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $1.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, research and development\nexpense of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $411,000 and $454,000, respectively.

In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of\nthe Board of Directors 8,044 and 6,588 shares, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n20\nPerformance Unit Awards\nEach performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting\nrequirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to EBITDA and cash flow achievement, as measured over a specific performance period. The\nmarket-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics\nComponents Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three\ntimes the shares granted. Further, if the Company's performance falls below certain thresholds, the performance units will not vest at all.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 69,600 performance units, of which 34,798 units are subject to performance-\nbased vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative adjusted EBITDA, 17,401 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on\nthree-year cumulative gross margin and 17,401 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit\nawards granted was $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units\nwith performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $605,000 and $1.5\nmillion, respectively, research and development expense of $269,000 and $607,000, respectively, and cost of sales expense of $167,000 and $376,000,\nrespectively, related to the performance units.

The ESPP was approved by the Company’s\nshareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless\nterminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued.\nEligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which\nbegan on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common\nstock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day\nof the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85% of the lesser of the\nclosing price per share of common stock on the first business day of the period or the last business day of the period.\nEmployees may allocate up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may\npurchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a\ngiven calendar year.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company issued 11,654 and 13,915 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the\nESPP, resulting in proceeds of $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded charges of $29,000 and $36,000, respectively, to selling, general and\nadministrative expense, $69,000 and $61,000, respectively, to research and development expense, and $54,000 and $46,000, respectively, to cost of sales related\nto the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecorded charges of $101,000 and $105,000, respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $206,000 and $186,000, respectively, to research and\ndevelopment expense, and $151,000 and $121,000, respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-\nback feature.\n21\nScientific Advisory Board Awards\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted a total of 1,616 and 2,366 shares, respectively, of fully vested\ncommon stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair value of shares issued\nto members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $300,000 for both nine-month periods.\n17. RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFIT LIABILITY:\nOn March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is\nto provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their\ncontinued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2024, there were seven participants in the SERP. In December 2022, one of the participants\nretired and monthly SERP benefit payments commenced in January 2023. The total SERP benefit payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were\n$1.5 million.\nThe Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount\nrates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to\nearn the SERP benefits.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nService cost $ 211 $ 238 $ 626 $ 713\nInterest cost 710 725 1,931 2,174\nCurtailment charge — — 312 —\nAmortization of prior service cost 6 203 27 611\nAmortization of loss — 120 — 360\nTotal net periodic benefit cost $ 927 $ 1,286 $ 2,896 $ 3,858\n18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nCommitments\nUnder the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that\nagreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC.\nUnder the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note\n11 for further explanation.\nThe Company has agreements with five executive officers and 11 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon\ntermination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in\nconnection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or\ntwo times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock\noptions and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items.\nIn order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement\n(see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm,\nnoncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s\nrequirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase\ncommitments for inventory of $47.7 million and $29.8 million, respectively.\nPatent Related Challenges and Oppositions\nEach major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued\npatent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent\n22\nin question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the\nreviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question.\nThe Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that\none or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company\nviews these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is\ninitiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable\ndecision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued\nclaims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these\nproceedings.\n19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK:\nRevenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands):\n% of Total Revenue for the % of Total Revenue for the\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of\nCustomer 2024 2023 2024 2023 September 30, 2024\nA 41% 45% 43% 37% $ 13,361\nB 24% 20% 24% 23% $ 38,028\nC 17% 12% 16% 15% $ 4,524\nD 6% 8% 6% 10% $ 8,615\nRevenues from outside of North America represented approximately 98% of consolidated revenue for both three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, and 98% for both nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nCountry 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSouth Korea $ 95,105 $ 87,231 $ 305,697 $ 235,320\nChina 61,366 48,687 164,072 163,634\nJapan 503 2,019 3,013 5,175\nOther non-U.S. locations 975 541 2,913 3,856\nTotal non-U.S. locations 157,949 138,478 475,695 407,985\nUnited States 3,678 2,599 9,696 10,124\nTotal revenue $ 161,627 $ 141,077 $ 485,391 $ 418,109\nThe Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer.\nProperty and equipment, net by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnited States $ 119,335 $ 118,250\nIreland 57,374 42,203\nOther 14,486 14,697\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 191,195 $ 175,150\nSubstantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation.\n20. INCOME TAXES:\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 4.4% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 18.8% and 16.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nCompany recorded an income tax expense of $14.5 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $40.7\nmillion and $28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective\ntax rate is primarily due to the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions partially offset by nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax\n23\n(GILTI and Subpart F). During the third quarter of 2023, a change in the U.S. tax regulations associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as\nwell as a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses resulted in a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three months\nended September 30, 2023.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain\nbenefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the\nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is not sufficient evidence to release\nthe valuation allowance that has been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany recognized an unrealized gain of $4.1 million on available-for-sale securities. The valuation allowance of $1.7 million that resulted from an unrealized\nloss on available-for-sale securities during prior periods was reversed through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. There are no indicators against the realizability of the remaining net deferred tax asset.\nOn December 27, 2018, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are\nconsidered Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company\nhas incurred Korean withholding tax of $14.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, through December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean\nSupreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for the entire period from\nJanuary 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022. The Company received a formal rejection from the KNTS; and in May 2022 filed an appeal with the Korean Tax\nTribunal. On December 18, 2023, the Company received a formal rejection from the Tax Tribunal. Anticipating the rejection of the appeal, in September 2023 the\nCompany filed a petition to the District Court and is awaiting its decision. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-\nlikely-than-not chance of success. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $59.7 million and $60.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively for the receipt of the Korean withholding tax. The Company also recorded foreign exchange gain of $3.2 million and foreign\nexchange loss of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and foreign exchange loss of $545,000 and $3.3 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the fluctuation of the Korean Won to the U.S. Dollar and resulting remeasurement of\nthis Won-denominated receivable. The Company will amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2022 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is\nreceived to offset the additional tax liability. The Company has recorded a long-term liability of $15.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nfor the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns, indicating that lower withholding\namounts were required.\nThe Company is not subject to examinations by the federal tax authority for the years prior to 2020. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open\nfor a period of generally three to four years. The Company is under California tax audit for 2019 and 2020 years, which is in the information-collecting stage.\nThe above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement.\n21. REVENUE RECOGNITION:\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard establishes the\nprinciples that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and\ncash flows from a contract with a customer.\nFor both three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded 98% of its revenue from OLED related sales and 2% from the\nproviding of services through Adesis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded 98% and 97%, respectively, of its revenue\nfrom OLED related sales and 2% and 3%, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis.\n24\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAccounts receivable $ 87,693\nShort-term unbilled receivables 50,213\nLong-term unbilled receivables 19,165\nShort-term contract assets 2,909\nLong-term contract assets 7,174\nShort-term deferred revenue 47,393\nLong-term deferred revenue 2,376\nShort-term and long-term unbilled receivables and contract assets are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Contract assets represent consideration related to the renewal of customer contracts which is recognized over the contract term based on material\nunits sold. The deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2024 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $24.4 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter\nmaterial. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days.\nSignificant changes in the assets and liabilities balances associated with the Company's contracts from customers for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAssets Liabilities\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 42,134 $ (59,719)\nRevenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 86,825\nIncreases due to cash received — (82,928)\nCumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of\ntransaction price, net — 6,053\nUnbilled receivables recorded, net 109,246 —\nContract assets recorded, net (1,893) —\nTransferred to receivables from unbilled receivables (70,026) —\nNet change 37,327 9,950\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 79,461 $ (49,769)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nAssets Liabilities\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,457 $ (63,878)\nRevenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 143,064\nIncreases due to cash received — (159,989)\nCumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of\n5,116\ntransaction price, net —\nUnbilled receivables recorded, net 29,094 —\nContract assets recorded, net (1,860) —\nTransferred to receivables from unbilled receivables (24,893) —\nNet change 2,341 (11,809)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 40,798 $ (75,687)\nThe cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to revenue arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was an increase of $6.1 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the adjustment resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of\nthe Company's customers over the remaining lives of their contracts.\n25\n22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE:\nThe Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each\nclass of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the\nCompany's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other\nsecurity holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to\ndividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's\nunvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-\nconverted basis.\nFor purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive\ncommon shares outstanding, including restricted stock units, performance units and the impact of shares to be issued under the Company's Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 66,870 $ 51,516 $ 176,060 $ 141,033\nAdjustment for Basic EPS:\nEarnings allocated to unvested shareholders (126) (243) (452) (709)\nAdjusted net income $ 66,744 $ 51,273 $ 175,608 $ 140,324\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,542,114 47,570,099 47,549,976 47,555,734\nEffect of dilutive shares:\nCommon stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 276 499 1,179 1,764\nRestricted stock awards and units and performance units 127,049 61,833 92,871 52,194\nWeighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,669,439 47,632,431 47,644,026 47,609,692\nNet income per common share:\nBasic $ 1.40 $ 1.08 $ 3.69 $ 2.95\nDiluted $ 1.40 $ 1.08 $ 3.69 $ 2.95\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and\nperformance unit awards of 17,538 and 39,426, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit\nawards of 13,530 and 34,291, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive.\n26\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes above.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nCONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of\noperations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,”\n“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of\nour experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe\nare appropriate in these circumstances.\nAs you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand\nthat these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are\ndiscussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by\ndisclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause\nactual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not\nundertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of\nunanticipated events.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display\napplications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive\napplications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and\nperforming research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive\nour revenue primarily from the following:\n• sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing;\n• intellectual property and technology licensing;\n• technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for\ncommercialization of their OLED products; and\n• contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED\napplications.\nMaterial sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and\nevaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery,\ndepending upon the contractual agreement between the parties.\nWe receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-\nrefundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain\ncommercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the\ncontract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract.\nOn December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license\nagreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee,\nwhich includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement\n27\nterm of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less\nthan the estimated life of the assets.\nAt the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC,\nwhich lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous\npurchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and\ngreen phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for\nphosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement.\nIn 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which\nwere effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license\nagreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license\ncalls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials\nfor use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to\nthe volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue.\nIn 2023, we entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted\nBOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply\nphosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products.\nIn 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology\nCo., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license\nrights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT\nfor use in its licensed products.\nIn 2024, we entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under these agreements, we have granted\nVisionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. Additionally, we supply\nphosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products.\nIn 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma).\nUnder the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell\nOLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply\nphosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and\nmaterial purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term.\nIn 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract development and\nmanufacturing organization (CDMO) that provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and\nother industries. As of September 30, 2024, Adesis employed a team of 137 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our\nacquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its\ntechnology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CDMO by providing\ncontract research services for non-OLED applications to third-party customers in the above-mentioned industries. Contract research services revenue is earned by\nproviding chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party\ncustomers.\nIn June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was\nfounded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of September 30, 2024, OVJP Corp employed a\nteam of 26 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential\nto offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the\nwaste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid\nsolvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and\neliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the\npotential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED\nmaterials and technologies.\n28\nIn February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and\nPPG for the production of our OLED materials. We purchased the site during September 2023. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our\nproduction capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been\ncompleted and operations commenced in June 2022.\nWe also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization\nassistance fees.\nWe anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors:\n• the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials;\n• the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation;\n• the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related\nactivities; and\n• the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\nREVENUE:\nMaterial sales $ 83,428 $ 92,492 $ (9,064)\nRoyalty and license fees 74,590 45,915 28,675\nContract research services 3,609 2,670 939\nTotal revenue 161,627 141,077 20,550\nCOST OF SALES 35,812 34,248 1,564\nGross margin 125,815 106,829 18,986\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nResearch and development 36,089 33,099 2,990\nSelling, general and administrative 15,664 18,084 (2,420)\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 4,551 4,557 (6)\nPatent costs 2,352 2,572 (220)\nRoyalty and license expense 154 81 73\nTotal operating expenses 58,810 58,393 417\nOPERATING INCOME 67,005 48,436 18,569\nInterest income, net 10,592 7,136 3,456\nOther income (loss), net 3,819 (1,693) 5,512\nInterest and other income, net 14,411 5,443 8,968\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 81,416 53,879 27,537\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE (14,546) (2,363) (12,183)\nNET INCOME $ 66,870 $ 51,516 $ 15,354\nRevenue\nOur total material sales were $83.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $92.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, a decrease of 10% with an increase in unit material volume of 1%. The decrease in material sales was primarily due to customer mix.\n• Green emitter sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $62.6 million as\ncompared to $68.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes decreasing by 1%.\n• Red emitter sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $20.1 million as compared to $22.1 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes increasing by 6%.\n29\nRevenue from royalty and license fees was $74.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $45.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 62%. The increase was primarily the result of changes in customer mix and the change in the cumulative catch-\nup adjustment between periods as described below.\nThe cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to revenue arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was an increase of $5.3 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a decrease of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the adjustment resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by\nseveral of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts.\nContract research services revenue was $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $2.7 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35%. The increase in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of completion of several\ncontract research projects by our subsidiary, Adesis, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from contract research services consists of\nrevenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nprimarily due to product mix and an increase in unit material volume. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees, partially offset by a\ndecrease in revenue from material sales, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $19.0 million as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 78% from 76%.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased to $36.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $33.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased PPG\ndevelopment activity.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $18.1 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related expenses,\nincluding incentive and stock-based compensation expenses.\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $4.6 million for both three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nPatent costs\nPatent costs decreased to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023.\nRoyalty and license expense\nRoyalty and license expense increased to $154,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $81,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nInterest and other income, net\nInterest income, net was $10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other income\n(loss), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, net investment gains and losses, and rental income. We recorded\nother income, net of $3.8\n30\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other loss, net of $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 4.4% for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $14.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for those periods. During\nthe third quarter of 2023, a change in the U.S. tax regulations associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as a change in the\ncapitalization rules for research and development expenses resulted in a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nComparison of the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\nREVENUE:\nMaterial sales $ 272,154 $ 239,789 $ 32,365\nRoyalty and license fees 202,409 165,524 36,885\nContract research services 10,828 12,796 (1,968)\nTotal revenue 485,391 418,109 67,282\nCOST OF SALES 111,109 99,357 11,752\nGross margin 374,282 318,752 55,530\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nResearch and development 110,900 96,840 14,060\nSelling, general and administrative 54,757 50,557 4,200\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 13,648 11,442 2,206\nPatent costs 6,735 7,056 (321)\nRoyalty and license expense 1,928 414 1,514\nTotal operating expenses 187,968 166,309 21,659\nOPERATING INCOME 186,314 152,443 33,871\nInterest income, net 30,073 20,301 9,772\nOther income (loss), net 416 (3,180) 3,596\nInterest and other income, net 30,489 17,121 13,368\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 216,803 169,564 47,239\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE (40,743) (28,531) (12,212)\nNET INCOME $ 176,060 $ 141,033 $ 35,027\nRevenue\nOur total material sales were $272.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $239.8 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, an increase of 13% with an increase in unit material volume of 19%. The increase in material sales was primarily due to strengthened\ndemand for our emitter materials, partially offset by changes in customer mix.\n• Green emitter sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $205.0 million as\ncompared to $180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes increasing by 17%.\n• Red emitter sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $63.3 million as compared to $54.9 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes increasing by 27%.\nRevenue from royalty and license fees was $202.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $165.5 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 22%. The increase in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of higher unit material volume and\nchanges in customer mix.\nThe cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to revenue arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was an increase of $6.1 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the adjustment resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of\nthe Company's customers over the remaining lives of their contracts.\n31\nContract research services revenue was $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $12.8 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15%. The decrease in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of completion of several\ncontract research projects by our subsidiary, Adesis, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from contract research services consists of\nrevenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $11.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nprimarily due to an increase in the level of materials sales and product mix, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in inventory reserve expense. As a result of\nthe increase in revenue from royalty and licenses fees and material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $55.5 million\nas compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 77% from 76%.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased to $110.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $96.8 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased PPG\ndevelopment activity, employee-related expenses and contract research costs.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $54.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $50.6 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related\nexpenses, including higher stock-based compensation and salaries expenses.\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets\nAmortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $11.4\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA\npatent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023.\nPatent costs\nPatent costs decreased to $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\nRoyalty and license expense\nRoyalty and license expense increased to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $414,000 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was due to a one-time expense of $1.5 million in connection with an amendment to our existing amended license agreement,\neffective as of October 9, 1997, with Princeton University and the University of Southern California.\nInterest and other income, net\nInterest income, net was $30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $20.3 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other income\n(loss), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, net investment gains and losses, and rental income. We recorded\nother income, net of $416,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other loss, net of $3.2 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 18.8% and 16.8% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $40.8 million and $28.5 million, respectively, for those periods.\n32\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash\nequivalents of $79.6 million, short-term investments of $472.0 million, and long-term U.S. Government bonds investments of $378.8 million for a total of $930.4\nmillion. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $92.0 million, short-term investments of $422.1 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond\ninvestments of $285.5 million for a total of $799.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $219.0 million resulting from $176.1 million of net income,\n$39.5 million from non-cash items including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles, and $3.4 million due to changes in our\noperating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in accounts receivable of $52.2 million and an increase in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.4 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $43.7 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $10.0\nmillion, a decrease in other liabilities of $4.3 million and an increase in inventory of $163,000.\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $117.7 million resulting from $141.0 million of net income and\n$50.7 million from non-cash items including depreciation, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $74.0 million reduction\ndue to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in accounts receivable of $29.5 million,\nan increase in other assets of $29.4 million, a decrease in other liabilities of $28.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of $32,000,\npartially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $11.8 million and a decrease in inventory of $1.8 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $167.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $75.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $137.1 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales and maturities of $43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a\ndecrease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $88.8 million. The decrease in the purchases of intangibles and property, plant and\nequipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Merck KGaA patent acquisition on April 28, 2023.\nCash used in financing activities was $64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $56.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $7.8 million and an increase in the\npayment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $356,000, partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of\ncommon stock of $244,000.\nWorking capital was $810.7 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $798.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to\nincreases in short-term investments and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.\nWe anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working\ncapital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the\ntiming and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have\nsufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nWe believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and\ndebt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED\ntechnologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the\ntiming and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ\nsignificantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions.\n33\nWe believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting\npolicies” as contemplated by the SEC.\nRefer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our contractual obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets\ntransferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or\nobligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk\nsupport to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative\ncommodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary\nmarket risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments.\nHowever, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a\nmaterial negative effect on our interest income.\nSubstantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no\nsignificant foreign exchange risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated,\ncannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nPatent Related Challenges and Oppositions\nEach major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued\npatent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for\nclaims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The\n34\nconclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and\njurisdiction in question.\nWe believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more\nclaims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as\nreflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general\nmatter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending\non the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe\nthat as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors previously discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNone.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers entered into, modified or terminated, contracts, instructions or\nwritten plans for the sale or purchase of our securities that were intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1.\n35\nITEM 6.
