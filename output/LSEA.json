For the quarter, the Company reported pretax income of $14.9 million, and net income of $11.1 million, or $0.30 per share. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) was $15.9 million or $0.44 per share and adjusted gross margin was 22.8%. Reported pretax income for the prior year period was $12.5 million with net income of $8.6 million, or $0.22 per share. For the prior year period, adjusted net income was $11.7 million, or $0.30 per share and adjusted gross margin was 24.0%.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Landsea Homes delivered strong top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter of 2024, as new home deliveries increased 40% year-over-year,” said John Ho, Chief Executive Officer of Landsea Homes. “Home sales gross margin came in above our stated guidance range at 17.1%, and SG&A as a percent of home sales revenue improved 250 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net result was earnings of $0.30 per diluted share, representing a 36% improvement over the prior year period.”\n\nMr. Ho continued, “We saw solid demand in our markets during the quarter, as our High Performance Homes and attractive financing incentives to aid with affordability continued to appeal to homebuyers. Housing fundamentals continue to favor the public builders, driven by a lack of existing home inventory, steady demand and a resilient economy. We believe these factors serve as an excellent backdrop for our company, as we look to grow our existing operations.”\n\nMr. Ho concluded, “We are starting to see the benefits of our increased size through better terms and pricing from our trade partners and suppliers. We believe this dynamic will continue to benefit our company at the local and national level as we become a bigger player within the industry. With an established presence in several high-growth markets, a differentiated product offering and a solid and improving balance sheet, Landsea Homes is well positioned to finish 2024 on a strong note and carry momentum into the new year.”\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $338.5 million in the third quarter, up 22% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a 40% increase in homes closed partially offset by a 10% decrease in average selling price as both Texas and Colorado contributed to our volume.\n\nNew homes delivered increased 40.4% to 629 homes at an average sales price of $518,000, a 10% decrease, compared to 448 homes delivered at an average sales price of $576,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet new home orders were up 28.8% to 626 homes with a dollar value of $307.6 million, an average sales price of $491,000 and a monthly absorption rate of 2.5 sales per active community. This compares to 486 homes with a dollar value of $285.0 million, an average sales price of $587,000 and a monthly absorption rate of 2.7 sales per active community in the prior year period. As a percentage of gross orders, cancellations equaled 11% as compared to 9% a year ago.\n\nTotal homes in backlog were 691 homes with a dollar value of $373.1 million and an average sales price of $540,000 at September 30, 2024. This compares to 760 homes with a dollar value of $482.7 million and an average sales price of $635,000 at September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal lots owned or controlled at September 30, 2024, were 11,868 compared to 11,203 at September 30, 2023. We continue to pursue an asset-light strategy, controlling 56% of our lots at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 44% owned.\n\nHome sales gross margin was 17.1% compared to 18.7% in the prior year period. Adjusted home sales gross margin (a non-GAAP measure) was 22.8% compared to 24.0% in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributed to an elevated level of sales discounts and incentives as well as higher interest costs.\n\nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes increased 29% to $11.1 million compared to $8.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes (a non-GAAP measure) was $15.9 million compared to $11.7 million in the prior year period.

Words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “look” or similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the future financial performance of Landsea Homes; changes in the market for Landsea Homes’ products and services; and other expansion plans and opportunities.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this press release and our management’s current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described by Landsea Homes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this press release, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance and include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * the cyclical nature of our industry and the possibility that adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes;\n  * our ability to develop communities successfully and in a timely manner;\n  * changes in the terms and availability of mortgage financing, interest rates, federal lending programs, and tax laws, affecting the demand for and the ability of our homebuyers to complete the purchase of a home;\n  * our geographic concentration, which could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should experience a decline;\n  * the potential for adverse weather and geological conditions to increase costs, cause project delays or reduce consumer demand for housing;\n  * our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions, and the risk that we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time;\n  * our reliance on third-party skilled labor, suppliers and long supply chains;\n  * the dependence of our long-term sustainability and growth upon our ability to acquire lots that are either developed or have the approvals necessary for us to develop them; and\n  * the other risks and uncertainties indicated in Landsea Homes’ SEC reports or documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Landsea Homes. \n\n\n\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in deciding whether to invest in our securities.

We believe the below information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness, impairments, and acquisitions have on our gross margins and allows for comparability to previous periods and competitors.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **%** | **2023** | **%**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nHome sales revenue | $ | 325,610 | 100.0 | % | $ | 258,062 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of home sales | 270,091 | 82.9 | % | 209,753 | 81.3 | %  \nHome sales gross margin | 55,519 | 17.1 | % | 48,309 | 18.7 | %  \nAdd: Interest in cost of home sales | 12,285 | 3.8 | % | 9,713 | 3.8 | %  \nAdd: Real estate inventories impairment | 800 | 0.2 | % | — | — | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest and real estate inventories impairment | 68,604 | 21.1 | % | 58,022 | 22.5 | %  \nAdd: Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 5,604 | 1.7 | % | 3,865 | 1.5 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | $ | 74,208 | 22.8 | % | $ | 61,887 | 24.0 | %  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **%** | **2023** | **%**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nHome sales revenue | $ | 1,036,384 | 100.0 | % | $ | 790,199 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of home sales | 874,724 | 84.4 | % | 647,642 | 82.0 | %  \nHome sales gross margin | 161,660 | 15.6 | % | 142,557 | 18.0 | %  \nAdd: Interest in cost of home sales | 39,916 | 3.9 | % | 21,531 | 2.7 | %  \nAdd: Real estate inventories impairment | 800 | 0.1 | % | 4,700 | 0.6 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest and real estate inventories impairment | 202,376 | 19.5 | % | 168,788 | 21.4 | %  \nAdd: Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 16,679 | 1.6 | % | 14,060 | 1.8 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | $ | 219,055 | 21.1 | % | $ | 182,848 | 23.1 | %  \n  \n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nThe following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in evaluating operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) income tax expense (benefit), (ii) interest expenses, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) inventory impairments, (v) purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, (vi) loss on debt modification, (vii) transaction costs related to the Merger and business combinations, (viii) write-off of deferred offering costs, and (ix) abandoned projects costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest, effective tax rates, levels of depreciation and amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. Accordingly, we believe this measure is useful for comparing our core operating performance from period to period. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nNet income | $ | 11,391 | $ | 9,483  \nProvision for income taxes | 3,498 | 3,066  \nInterest in cost of sales | 13,643 | 10,006  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 2,129 | 1,221  \nEBITDA | 30,661 | 23,776  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | —  \nPurchase price accounting in cost of home sales | 5,604 | 3,865  \nTransaction costs | 664 | 600  \nAbandoned project costs | (52 | ) | 433  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 37,677 | $ | 28,674  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nNet income | $ | 15,360 | $ | 19,472  \nProvision for income taxes | 4,838 | 6,323  \nInterest in cost of sales | 42,224 | 21,878  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 5,299 | 3,778  \nEBITDA | 67,721 | 51,451  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | 4,700  \nPurchase price accounting in cost of home sales | 16,679 | 14,060  \nTransaction costs | 5,253 | 633  \nWrite-off of offering costs | — | 436  \nAbandoned project costs | 1,902 | 745  \nLoss on debt modification | 5,180 | —  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 97,535 | $ | 72,025  \n  \n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating and understanding our operating results without the effect of certain expenses that were historically pushed down by our parent company and other non-recurring items. We believe excluding these items provides a more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is calculated by excluding the effects of related party interest that was pushed down by our parent company, purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, loss on debt modification, and inventory impairment, and tax-effected using a blended statutory tax rate. We also adjust for the expense of related party interest pushed down from our parent company as we have no obligation to repay the debt and related interest.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_  \nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 11,110 | $ | 8,596  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | —  \nPre-Merger capitalized related party interest included in cost of sales | 10 | 324  \nPurchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 5,604 | 3,865  \nTotal adjustments | 6,414 | 4,189  \nTax-effected adjustments (1) | 4,783 | 3,088  \nAdjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 15,893 | $ | 11,684  \nEarnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.22  \nDiluted | $ | 0.30 | $ | 0.22  \nAdjusted earnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.44 | $ | 0.30  \nDiluted | $ | 0.44 | $ | 0.30  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - basic | 36,279,056 | 38,336,100  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - diluted | 36,497,337 | 38,440,392  \n  \n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_  \nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 14,185 | $ | 16,761  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | 4,700  \nPre-Merger capitalized related party interest included in cost of sales | 129 | 1,587  \nPurchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 16,679 | 14,060  \nLoss on debt modification | 5,180 | —  \nTotal adjustments | 22,788 | 20,347  \nTax-effected adjustments (1) | 16,994 | 14,997  \nAdjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 31,179 | $ | 31,758  \nEarnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.43  \nDiluted | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.42  \nAdjusted earnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.86 | $ | 0.81  \nDiluted | $ | 0.85 | $ | 0.80  \nWeighted shares outstanding  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - basic | 36,252,957 | 39,402,507  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - diluted | 36,548,768 | 39,549,035  \n  \n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n\n**Net Debt to Total Capital**\n\nThe following table presents the ratio of debt to capital as well as the ratio of net debt to total capital which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ratio of debt to capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net of issuance costs, by total capital (sum of total debt, net of issuance costs, plus total equity).\n\nThe non-GAAP ratio of net debt to total capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net of issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents as well as cash held in escrow to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by total capital. The most comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. We believe the ratio of net debt to total capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt to capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio of net debt to total capital provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered.\n\nSee table below reconciling this non-GAAP measure to the ratio of debt to capital.\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nTotal notes and other debts payable, net | $ | 732,138 | $ | 543,774  \nTotal equity | 681,022 | 688,352  \nTotal capital | $ | 1,413,160 | $ | 1,232,126  \nRatio of debt to capital | 51.8 | % | 44.1 | %  \nTotal notes and other debts payable, net | $ | 732,138 | $ | 543,774  \nLess: cash and cash equivalents | 32,198 | 119,555  \nLess: cash held in escrow | 4,054 | 49,091  \nNet debt | 695,886 | 375,128  \nTotal capital | $ | 1,413,160 | $ | 1,232,126  \nRatio of net debt to total capital | 49.2 | % | 30.4 | %  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0563df17-d1d7-4d00-9272-162763950ac1/small/landsea-homes-logo-2-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0563df17-d1d7-4d00-9272-162763950ac1)\n\nSource: Landsea Homes \n\nReleased November 4, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.landseahomes.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n\n### Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

For the quarter, the Company reported pretax income of $14.9 million, and net income of $11.1 million, or $0.30 per share. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) was $15.9 million or $0.44 per share and adjusted gross margin was 22.8%. Reported pretax income for the prior year period was $12.5 million with net income of $8.6 million, or $0.22 per share. For the prior year period, adjusted net income was $11.7 million, or $0.30 per share and adjusted gross margin was 24.0%.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Landsea Homes delivered strong top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter of 2024, as new home deliveries increased 40% year-over-year,” said John Ho, Chief Executive Officer of Landsea Homes. “Home sales gross margin came in above our stated guidance range at 17.1%, and SG&A as a percent of home sales revenue improved 250 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net result was earnings of $0.30 per diluted share, representing a 36% improvement over the prior year period.”\n\nMr. Ho continued, “We saw solid demand in our markets during the quarter, as our High Performance Homes and attractive financing incentives to aid with affordability continued to appeal to homebuyers. Housing fundamentals continue to favor the public builders, driven by a lack of existing home inventory, steady demand and a resilient economy. We believe these factors serve as an excellent backdrop for our company, as we look to grow our existing operations.”\n\nMr. Ho concluded, “We are starting to see the benefits of our increased size through better terms and pricing from our trade partners and suppliers. We believe this dynamic will continue to benefit our company at the local and national level as we become a bigger player within the industry. With an established presence in several high-growth markets, a differentiated product offering and a solid and improving balance sheet, Landsea Homes is well positioned to finish 2024 on a strong note and carry momentum into the new year.”\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $338.5 million in the third quarter, up 22% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a 40% increase in homes closed partially offset by a 10% decrease in average selling price as both Texas and Colorado contributed to our volume.\n\nNew homes delivered increased 40.4% to 629 homes at an average sales price of $518,000, a 10% decrease, compared to 448 homes delivered at an average sales price of $576,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet new home orders were up 28.8% to 626 homes with a dollar value of $307.6 million, an average sales price of $491,000 and a monthly absorption rate of 2.5 sales per active community. This compares to 486 homes with a dollar value of $285.0 million, an average sales price of $587,000 and a monthly absorption rate of 2.7 sales per active community in the prior year period. As a percentage of gross orders, cancellations equaled 11% as compared to 9% a year ago.\n\nTotal homes in backlog were 691 homes with a dollar value of $373.1 million and an average sales price of $540,000 at September 30, 2024. This compares to 760 homes with a dollar value of $482.7 million and an average sales price of $635,000 at September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal lots owned or controlled at September 30, 2024, were 11,868 compared to 11,203 at September 30, 2023. We continue to pursue an asset-light strategy, controlling 56% of our lots at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 44% owned.\n\nHome sales gross margin was 17.1% compared to 18.7% in the prior year period. Adjusted home sales gross margin (a non-GAAP measure) was 22.8% compared to 24.0% in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributed to an elevated level of sales discounts and incentives as well as higher interest costs.\n\nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes increased 29% to $11.1 million compared to $8.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes (a non-GAAP measure) was $15.9 million compared to $11.7 million in the prior year period. Net income per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.30, a 36% increase compared to $0.22 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income per share (a non-GAAP measure) on a fully diluted basis was $0.44 compared to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $37.7 million compared to $28.7 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $263.0 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents as well as cash held in escrow of $36.3 million and $226.7 million in availability under the Company’s $455.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Total debt was $732.1 million compared to $543.8 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nLandsea Homes’ ratio of debt to capital was 51.8% at September 30, 2024, and the Company’s net debt to total capital (a non-GAAP measure) was 49.2% at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Outlook**\n\n  * New home deliveries anticipated to be in the range of 2,890 to 3,000\n  * Delivery ASPs expected to be in the range of $520,000 to $535,000\n  * Adjusted home sales gross margin of approximately 21%\n  * Home sales gross margin of approximately 15%\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and conduct a question-and-answer session.\n\n  * Toll-free dial-in number: 1-800-274-8461\n  * International dial-in number: 1-203-518-9814\n\n\n\nThe conference call will be broadcast live and available for replay in the Investors section of the Landsea Homes website at https://ir.landseahomes.com/.\n\nA replay of the conference call will be available approximately three hours after conference end time through November 18, 2024.\n\n**Replay Details:**\n\n  * Toll-free replay number: 1-844-512-2921\n  * International replay number: 1-412-317-6671\n  * Replay ID: 11157369 \n\n\n\n**About Landsea Homes Corporation**\n\nLandsea Homes Corporation (Nasdaq: LSEA) is a publicly traded residential homebuilder based in Dallas, Texas that designs and builds best-in-class homes and sustainable master-planned communities in some of the nation's most desirable markets.

These statements constitute projections, forecasts, and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. Landsea Homes cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “look” or similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the future financial performance of Landsea Homes; changes in the market for Landsea Homes’ products and services; and other expansion plans and opportunities.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this press release and our management’s current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described by Landsea Homes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this press release, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance and include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * the cyclical nature of our industry and the possibility that adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes;\n  * our ability to develop communities successfully and in a timely manner;\n  * changes in the terms and availability of mortgage financing, interest rates, federal lending programs, and tax laws, affecting the demand for and the ability of our homebuyers to complete the purchase of a home;\n  * our geographic concentration, which could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should experience a decline;\n  * the potential for adverse weather and geological conditions to increase costs, cause project delays or reduce consumer demand for housing;\n  * our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions, and the risk that we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time;\n  * our reliance on third-party skilled labor, suppliers and long supply chains;\n  * the dependence of our long-term sustainability and growth upon our ability to acquire lots that are either developed or have the approvals necessary for us to develop them; and\n  * the other risks and uncertainties indicated in Landsea Homes’ SEC reports or documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Landsea Homes. \n\n\n\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in deciding whether to invest in our securities.

Margins**\n\nHome sales gross margin measures the price achieved on delivered homes compared to the costs needed to build the home. In the following table, we calculate gross margins adjusting for interest in cost of sales, inventory impairments, and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company's operating results in accordance with GAAP. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the below information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness, impairments, and acquisitions have on our gross margins and allows for comparability to previous periods and competitors.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **%** | **2023** | **%**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nHome sales revenue | $ | 325,610 | 100.0 | % | $ | 258,062 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of home sales | 270,091 | 82.9 | % | 209,753 | 81.3 | %  \nHome sales gross margin | 55,519 | 17.1 | % | 48,309 | 18.7 | %  \nAdd: Interest in cost of home sales | 12,285 | 3.8 | % | 9,713 | 3.8 | %  \nAdd: Real estate inventories impairment | 800 | 0.2 | % | — | — | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest and real estate inventories impairment | 68,604 | 21.1 | % | 58,022 | 22.5 | %  \nAdd: Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 5,604 | 1.7 | % | 3,865 | 1.5 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | $ | 74,208 | 22.8 | % | $ | 61,887 | 24.0 | %  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **%** | **2023** | **%**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nHome sales revenue | $ | 1,036,384 | 100.0 | % | $ | 790,199 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of home sales | 874,724 | 84.4 | % | 647,642 | 82.0 | %  \nHome sales gross margin | 161,660 | 15.6 | % | 142,557 | 18.0 | %  \nAdd: Interest in cost of home sales | 39,916 | 3.9 | % | 21,531 | 2.7 | %  \nAdd: Real estate inventories impairment | 800 | 0.1 | % | 4,700 | 0.6 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest and real estate inventories impairment | 202,376 | 19.5 | % | 168,788 | 21.4 | %  \nAdd: Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 16,679 | 1.6 | % | 14,060 | 1.8 | %  \nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory | $ | 219,055 | 21.1 | % | $ | 182,848 | 23.1 | %  \n  \n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nThe following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in evaluating operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) income tax expense (benefit), (ii) interest expenses, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) inventory impairments, (v) purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, (vi) loss on debt modification, (vii) transaction costs related to the Merger and business combinations, (viii) write-off of deferred offering costs, and (ix) abandoned projects costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest, effective tax rates, levels of depreciation and amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. Accordingly, we believe this measure is useful for comparing our core operating performance from period to period. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nNet income | $ | 11,391 | $ | 9,483  \nProvision for income taxes | 3,498 | 3,066  \nInterest in cost of sales | 13,643 | 10,006  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 2,129 | 1,221  \nEBITDA | 30,661 | 23,776  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | —  \nPurchase price accounting in cost of home sales | 5,604 | 3,865  \nTransaction costs | 664 | 600  \nAbandoned project costs | (52 | ) | 433  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 37,677 | $ | 28,674  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nNet income | $ | 15,360 | $ | 19,472  \nProvision for income taxes | 4,838 | 6,323  \nInterest in cost of sales | 42,224 | 21,878  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 5,299 | 3,778  \nEBITDA | 67,721 | 51,451  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | 4,700  \nPurchase price accounting in cost of home sales | 16,679 | 14,060  \nTransaction costs | 5,253 | 633  \nWrite-off of offering costs | — | 436  \nAbandoned project costs | 1,902 | 745  \nLoss on debt modification | 5,180 | —  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 97,535 | $ | 72,025  \n  \n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating and understanding our operating results without the effect of certain expenses that were historically pushed down by our parent company and other non-recurring items. We believe excluding these items provides a more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is calculated by excluding the effects of related party interest that was pushed down by our parent company, purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, loss on debt modification, and inventory impairment, and tax-effected using a blended statutory tax rate. We also adjust for the expense of related party interest pushed down from our parent company as we have no obligation to repay the debt and related interest.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_  \nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 11,110 | $ | 8,596  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | —  \nPre-Merger capitalized related party interest included in cost of sales | 10 | 324  \nPurchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 5,604 | 3,865  \nTotal adjustments | 6,414 | 4,189  \nTax-effected adjustments (1) | 4,783 | 3,088  \nAdjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 15,893 | $ | 11,684  \nEarnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.22  \nDiluted | $ | 0.30 | $ | 0.22  \nAdjusted earnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.44 | $ | 0.30  \nDiluted | $ | 0.44 | $ | 0.30  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - basic | 36,279,056 | 38,336,100  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - diluted | 36,497,337 | 38,440,392  \n  \n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_  \nNet income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 14,185 | $ | 16,761  \nReal estate inventories impairment | 800 | 4,700  \nPre-Merger capitalized related party interest included in cost of sales | 129 | 1,587  \nPurchase price accounting for acquired inventory | 16,679 | 14,060  \nLoss on debt modification | 5,180 | —  \nTotal adjustments | 22,788 | 20,347  \nTax-effected adjustments (1) | 16,994 | 14,997  \nAdjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation | $ | 31,179 | $ | 31,758  \nEarnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.43  \nDiluted | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.42  \nAdjusted earnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.86 | $ | 0.81  \nDiluted | $ | 0.85 | $ | 0.80  \nWeighted shares outstanding  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - basic | 36,252,957 | 39,402,507  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in EPS - diluted | 36,548,768 | 39,549,035  \n  \n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n\n**Net Debt to Total Capital**\n\nThe following table presents the ratio of debt to capital as well as the ratio of net debt to total capital which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ratio of debt to capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net of issuance costs, by total capital (sum of total debt, net of issuance costs, plus total equity).\n\nThe non-GAAP ratio of net debt to total capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net of issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents as well as cash held in escrow to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by total capital. The most comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. We believe the ratio of net debt to total capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt to capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio of net debt to total capital provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered.\n\nSee table below reconciling this non-GAAP measure to the ratio of debt to capital.\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \nTotal notes and other debts payable, net | $ | 732,138 | $ | 543,774  \nTotal equity | 681,022 | 688,352  \nTotal capital | $ | 1,413,160 | $ | 1,232,126  \nRatio of debt to capital | 51.8 | % | 44.1 | %  \nTotal notes and other debts payable, net | $ | 732,138 | $ | 543,774  \nLess: cash and cash equivalents | 32,198 | 119,555  \nLess: cash held in escrow | 4,054 | 49,091  \nNet debt | 695,886 | 375,128  \nTotal capital | $ | 1,413,160 | $ | 1,232,126  \nRatio of net debt to total capital | 49.2 | % | 30.4 | %  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0563df17-d1d7-4d00-9272-162763950ac1/small/landsea-homes-logo-2-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0563df17-d1d7-4d00-9272-162763950ac1)\n\nSource: Landsea Homes \n\nReleased November 4, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.landseahomes.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n\n### Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

          "content": "Investor Presentation\nNovember 2024\nDisclaimer\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this presentation may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, our expectations for future financial performance, business\nstrategies or expectations for our business, including as they relate to anticipated effects of the business combination pursuant to that Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Landsea Homes\nCorporation (formerly LF Capital Acquisition Corp. or “LF Capital” and now the “Company” or “Landsea Homes”), a Delaware corporation, LFCA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of LF Capital,\nLandsea Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Landsea Holdings”), and Landsea Homes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Landsea Holdings, dated as of August 31, 2020 (the “Business\nCombination”). These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. Landsea Homes cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “look” or similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements. Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to: the benefits of the Business Combination and the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes (the\n“Acquisition”); the future financial performance of the Company; changes in the market for Landsea Homes’ products and services; and other expansion plans and opportunities.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this presentation and our management’s current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but not are limited to, the risk factors described by Landsea Homes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this\npress release, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance and include, but are not limited to: the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination and the\nAcquisition, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability to integrate the combined business and the acquired business, and the ability of the combined business and the acquired business to grow and\nmanage growth profitably; costs related to the Business Combination; the ability to maintain the listing of Landsea Homes’ securities on Nasdaq; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company;\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations; the inability to launch new Landsea Homes products or services or to profitably expand into new markets; the possibility that Landsea Homes may be adversely affected by other economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated in Landsea Homes’ SEC reports or documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Landsea Homes.\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in deciding whether to invest\nin our securities. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,\nexcept as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Any non-GAAP financial measures and other non-GAAP\nfinancial information used in this presentation are in addition to, and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures and other non-\nGAAP financial information is subject to significant inherent limitations. The non-GAAP financial measures Landsea Homes uses in this presentation include net debt to net capital, adjusted home sales gross margin, adjusted net\nincome, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures presents additional information which, when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, facilitates the\nanalysis of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may\ndiffer from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies may use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information should only be used to evaluate our financial results in\nconjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures\nused in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the Appendix to this presentation.\n2\nTable of Contents\n1.

Metrics\n(Non-GAAP)\nIn this presentation, we include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net debt to total capital, adjusted home sales gross margin, adjusted net\nincome, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors additional insights to facilitate the analysis of our\nresults of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or\nprinciples. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies\nmay use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures\nhave limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information\nshould only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented.\nNET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL\n32\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED HOME SALES GROSS MARGIN\n(1) This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company's operating results in accordance with GAAP. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial\nmeasure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful because it provides insight into the\nimpact that financing arrangements and acquisitions have on our homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our gross margins to competitors that present similar\ninformation.\n33\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED NET INCOME\n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n34\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nEBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n35"

          "content": "3Q 2024\nEarnings Presentation\nDisclaimer\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this presentation may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, our expectations for future financial performance, business\nstrategies or expectations for our business, including as they relate to anticipated effects of the business combination pursuant to that Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Landsea Homes\nCorporation (formerly LF Capital Acquisition Corp. or “LF Capital” and now the “Company” or “Landsea Homes”), a Delaware corporation, LFCA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of LF Capital,\nLandsea Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Landsea Holdings”), and Landsea Homes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Landsea Holdings, dated as of August 31, 2020 (the “Business\nCombination”). These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. Landsea Homes cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “look” or similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements. Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to: the benefits of the Business Combination and the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes (the\n“Acquisition”); the future financial performance of the Company; changes in the market for Landsea Homes’ products and services; and other expansion plans and opportunities.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this presentation and our management’s current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but not are limited to, the risk factors described by Landsea Homes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this\npress release, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance and include, but are not limited to: the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination and the\nAcquisition, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability to integrate the combined business and the acquired business, and the ability of the combined business and the acquired business to grow and\nmanage growth profitably; costs related to the Business Combination; the ability to maintain the listing of Landsea Homes’ securities on Nasdaq; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company;\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations; the inability to launch new Landsea Homes products or services or to profitably expand into new markets; the possibility that Landsea Homes may be adversely affected by other economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated in Landsea Homes’ SEC reports or documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Landsea Homes.\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in deciding whether to invest\nin our securities. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,\nexcept as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Any non-GAAP financial measures and other non-GAAP\nfinancial information used in this presentation are in addition to, and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures and other non-\nGAAP financial information is subject to significant inherent limitations. The non-GAAP financial measures Landsea Homes uses in this presentation include net debt to net capital, adjusted home sales gross margin, adjusted net\nincome, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures presents additional information which, when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, facilitates the\nanalysis of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may\ndiffer from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies may use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information should only be used to evaluate our financial results in\nconjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures\nused in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the Appendix to this presentation.\n2\nToday’s Presenters\nJohn Ho Michael Forsum Chris Porter\nChief Executive Officer President and Chief Financial Officer\nChief Operating Officer\n3\nBUSINESS\nREVIEW\n4\n19\nFinancial Highlights\n3Q 24 Highlights\n• Total Revenue of $338.5M up 22% from 3Q 2023 driven by\n40% increase in deliveries to 629, with an Average Sales\nPrice of $518,000\n• Net New Home orders of 626 for a total value of $307.6M, a\n29% increase in volume and 8% increase in dollar value\nfrom 3Q 2023\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $37.7M a 31% increase from 3Q 2023\n• Pre-Tax Income of $14.9M a 19% increase from 3Q 2023\n• Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes of $11.1M or\n$0.30 per diluted share\n• Adjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes of\n$15.9M or $0.44 per diluted share\n• Quarter-end homes in backlog of 691 for a total of $373.1M\n• Book Value per share of $18.27\nNote: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP metrics.

These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors additional insights to facilitate the analysis of our\nresults of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or\nprinciples. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies\nmay use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures\nhave limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information\nshould only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented.\nNET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL\n16\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED HOME SALES GROSS MARGIN\n(1) This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company's operating results in accordance with GAAP. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial\nmeasure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful because it provides insight into the\nimpact that financing arrangements and acquisitions have on our homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our gross margins to competitors that present similar\ninformation.\n17\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED NET INCOME\n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n18\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nEBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n19"
