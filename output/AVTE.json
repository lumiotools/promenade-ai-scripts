(Nasdaq: AVTE) (“Aerovate”) and Jade Biosciences (“Jade”), a privately held biotechnology company focused on developing best-in-class therapies for autoimmune diseases, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for an all-stock transaction. The resulting entity will focus on advancing Jade’s portfolio of novel biologics, including JADE-001, a promising anti-APRIL (“A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand”) monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) for IgA nephropathy (“IgAN”). Upon completion of the merger, the combined company plans to operate under the name Jade Biosciences and trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “JBIO.”\n\nIn support of the merger, Jade has secured commitments for an oversubscribed private investment that is expected to result in total gross proceeds of approximately $300 million from a syndicate of healthcare investors led by Fairmount, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, and a large investment firm, with participation from Deep Track Capital, Braidwell LP, Driehaus Capital Management, Frazier Life Sciences, RA Capital Management, Great Point Partners, Soleus Capital, Avidity Partners, Blackstone Multi-Asset Investing, Logos Capital, Deerfield Management, OrbiMed, and Samsara BioCapital, among other leading investment management firms. The financing includes common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock and reflects the conversion of the previously issued $95 million convertible notes.\n\nThe financing is expected to close immediately prior to completion of the merger, with the combined company’s cash balance at closing anticipated to fund Jade’s operations through 2027 and advance JADE-001 to initial clinical proof-of-concept. Prior to closing, Aerovate expects to declare a cash dividend to pre-merger Aerovate stockholders, distributing excess net cash expected to be approximately $65 million.\n\nTom Frohlich, Chief Executive Officer of Jade, commented: “Jade is focused on developing breakthrough treatments for autoimmune diseases, including JADE-001, which modulates plasma cell survival and immunoglobulin production, and which we plan to initially develop for the treatment of IgA nephropathy. As the fourth antibody therapeutics venture founded on assets licensed from Paragon Therapeutics, a leader in antibody discovery, Jade leverages Paragon’s proven success in developing innovative biologics. This merger, coupled with strong financial backing, positions us well to advance our programs into clinical development and make meaningful progress in treating autoimmune diseases.”\n\n“We believe this merger with Jade represents the best path forward for Aerovate stockholders,” said Tim Noyes, Chief Executive Officer of Aerovate. “The anticipated cash dividend, combined with Jade’s promising pipeline, offers a compelling opportunity for significant value creation, both in the near term and over the long run.”\n\n### **Jade Pipeline Overview and Development Milestones**\n\nJade’s focus is to develop transformational, disease modifying therapies targeting inflammation and immunology-related diseases. The company’s lead program, JADE-001, is a potential best-in-class antibody designed to block the APRIL protein, which plays a key role in the development of IgAN, a chronic kidney disease resulting from IgA-mediated inflammation and damage that can impair kidney function over time. By targeting the underlying pathogenesis of IgAN, JADE-001 aims to reduce IgA levels, lower protein levels in the urine (a key marker of kidney damage), and preserve long-term kidney function.\n\n“JADE-001 is engineered to deliver superior potency and an extended half-life compared to other anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies in development, optimizing efficacy with convenient, infrequent dosing,” said Andrew King, Chief Scientific Officer of Jade. “This profile makes it especially well-suited for patients with IgAN, a population that requires lifelong, disease-modifying therapy, often beginning in early adulthood.”\n\nJADE-001 is anticipated to enter the clinic in the second half of 2025, with initial data expected in the first half of 2026. In addition, Jade has initiated preclinical development of JADE-002 and JADE-003, two undisclosed optimized antibody programs.\n\n### **About the Proposed Transactions**\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, pre-merger Aerovate stockholders are expected to own approximately 1.6% of the combined company, while pre-merger Jade stockholders — including those investors participating in the pre-closing financing — are expected to own approximately 98.4% of the combined entity.\n\nAerovate is not expected to contribute funds to the new entity and expects to pay a dividend of approximately $65 million to pre-merger Aerovate stockholders immediately prior to the closing of the merger.\n\nThe transaction has received approval by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of both companies, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to register the securities to be issued in connection with the merger.\n\nThe combined company will be named Jade Biosciences and will be led by Tom Frohlich, Jade’s current Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Jade’s existing Board of Directors will remain in place, chaired by Eric Dobmeier, former President and CEO of Chinook Therapeutics and current Venture Partner at Samsara BioCapital. Board members include Lawrence Klein, Ph.D., CEO of Oruka Therapeutics; Erin Lavelle, former Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at ProfoundBio and Eliem Therapeutics; Chris Cain, Ph.D., Director of Research at Fairmount and Tomas Kiselak, Managing Member at Fairmount.\n\n**Advisory and Legal Counsel**\n\nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is serving as legal counsel to Jade. Jefferies, TD Cowen, Stifel, and Wedbush & Co., LLC are serving as placement agents to Jade, with Cooley LLP serving as legal counsel to the placement agents. Wedbush Securities Inc. is serving as exclusive strategic financial advisor to Aerovate, while Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as its legal counsel. Lucid Capital Markets, LLC is providing a fairness opinion to Aerovate’s Board of Directors.\n\n### **Conference Call Details**\n\nJade will host a conference call on October 31, 2024, at 8:30 AM EDT to discuss the merger details.

Its lead asset, JADE-001, will target the anti-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) pathway for immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, with Investigational New Drug Application-enabling studies underway and initiation of a first-in-human trial expected in the second half of 2025. Jade’s pipeline also includes two undisclosed optimized antibody discovery programs, JADE-002 and JADE-003, currently in preclinical development.

(Nasdaq: AVTE) today announced topline results from the Phase 2b portion of the **I** nhaled i**M** atinib **P** ulmonary **A** rterial **H** ypertension **C** linical **T** rial (IMPAHCT), a Phase 2b/Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial of AV-101, a novel dry powder inhaled formulation of imatinib, in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\n\nThe objective of the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three different doses of AV-101 compared to placebo. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT is change in PVR compared with placebo. Results showed that, while AV-101 was well tolerated across all dose groups, the study did not meet its primary endpoint for improvement in PVR compared to placebo for any of the studied doses or show meaningful improvements in the secondary endpoint of change in six minute walk distance (6MWD).\n\n**Primary Endpoint – ITT analysis of PVR**** _(dynes*sec/cm^5)_**\n\n**Dose**| **Least-squares mean difference as compared with placebo (95% CI)**| **P value**  \n---|---|---  \n10mg BID (N=50)| _42.8 (-80.57 to 166.09)_| _0.4968_  \n35mg BID (N=49)| _-5.5 (-129.16 to 118.18)_| _0.9306_  \n70mg BID (N=51)| _-57.0 (-181.14 to 67.20)_| _0.3685_  \n  \n**Secondary Endpoint – ITT analysis of 6MWD (****_meters_****)**\n\n**Dose**| **Least-squares mean difference as compared with placebo (95% CI)**  \n---|---  \n10mg BID (N=50)| -11.7 (-34.75 to 11.26)  \n35mg BID (N=49)| -4.2 (-27.74 to 19.37)  \n70mg BID (N=51)| +1.3 (-22.09 to 24.60)  \n  \nThe Company has also reviewed data from several additional secondary endpoints of the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT, which also failed to show meaningful improvements. Based upon these results, Aerovate, in agreement with the independent study advisory committee, is halting enrollment and shutting down the Phase 3 portion of IMPAHCT as well as the long-term extension study.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT were unexpected and disappointing. Our immediate focus is on transparently sharing these findings with investigators, patients and the PAH community. In the coming weeks, we will engage closely with the IMPAHCT study advisory committee and the PAH community to thoroughly discuss these data and their implications,” said Tim Noyes, Chief Executive Officer of Aerovate. “We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all trial participants, investigators, and site teams for their dedication to advancing therapeutic options for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.”\n\nAerovate plans to release full data from the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT at a later date, the timing of which is to be determined.\n\nAs of June 15, 2024, Aerovate has approximately $100 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\n**About AV-101** AV-101 is an investigational, proprietary dry powder inhaled formulation of the antiproliferative drug imatinib. Developed specifically for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), AV-101 targets cellular hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptosis, driven by improper signaling in cells of the distal pulmonary arteries. AV-101 is designed for delivery by an easy-to-use dry powder inhaler, directly into the lungs to maximize potential clinical benefit and limit systemic adverse effects.\n\n**About the IMPAHCT Trial** IMPAHCT (Inhaled iMatinib Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Clinical Trial) is a multi-national, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/Phase 3 trial in adults with PAH that continuously enrolled patients from Phase 2b to Phase 3. The Phase 2b portion of the trial evaluated three doses of AV-101 over 24 weeks, compared to placebo, to identify an optimal dose based on the primary endpoint, change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and safety, tolerability, and other clinical measures. More information about this trial is available at [_https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05036135_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=U1nf5Qz0nDPhGsVEIIbtPfszaH7gPoz_pcKvPFcT9HEZ4m3acCzTmIal0Xx4f3j767y9nKDiOSNIecgHJl8iJt_eP_-4IoUBpPXS5uQwbqU9lzdoyPuiYLwtRU8tPWu0eCf1o2L-h9Xj3Gjpq25zp-GqH6PZFlz_ma2zrG_xCCE=).\n\n**About Aerovate Therapeutics, Inc.** Aerovate is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs that meaningfully improve the lives of patients with rare cardiopulmonary disease. Aerovate's initial focus is on advancing AV-101, its proprietary dry powder inhaled formulation of the drug imatinib for the treatment of patients with PAH.
