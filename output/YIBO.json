          "content": "FISCAL 2Q’25\nUPDATE\nSeptember 5, 2024\nOLYMPIC RINGS, EIFFEL TOWER, PARIS, FRANCE\nAugust 11, 2024 • SkySat\nDisclaimers\nAll references to “Planet” or the “Company” in this presentation are references to Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL).\nForward-looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Planet's future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward looking\nstatements because they contain words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “develop,” “evolve,” “plan,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “could,”\n“can,” “should,” “would,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “strategy,” “opportunity,” “aim,” “conviction,” “continue,” “positioned” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or\nexpressions that concern Planet's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to, statements regarding\nPlanet’s financial guidance and outlook, Planet’s path to profitability (including on an Adjusted EBITDA basis), Planet’s expectations regarding future product development and\nperformance, Planet’s expectations regarding its strategies with respect to its markets and customers, Planet’s expectations regarding its ability to close deals in its pipeline, and the\nexpected benefits of such deals to its results of operations. Planet’s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including risks related to the macroeconomic environment and risks regarding Planet’s ability\nto forecast Planet’s performance due to Planet’s limited operating history. These forward-looking statements are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully\ndescribed in Planet's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including Planet’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent filings with the SEC Planet may\nmake. All forward-looking statements reflect Planet’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. Planet undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as may be required by law. Planet’s results for the quarter ended July 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of its operating\nresults for any future periods.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 2\nDisclaimers\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures Planet uses to supplement its results\npresented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Planet includes these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate Planet’s core operating\nperformance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments.\nPlanet presents Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA because Planet believes these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and\nother interested parties to evaluate companies in Planet’s industry and facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, Planet believes these\nmeasures are helpful in highlighting trends in its operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of Planet’s core operating performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled\nmeasures presented by other companies, which may have different definitions from Planet’s. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude stock-based\ncompensation expenses, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for Planet and an important part of its\ncompensation strategy.\nDefinitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the appendix to this\npresentation.\nFinancial Outlook\nPlanet has not reconciled its Non-GAAP financial outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain reconciling items, such as stock-based compensation\nexpenses and depreciation and amortization, are uncertain or out of Planet’s control and cannot be reasonably predicted. The actual amount of these expenses will have a\nsignificant impact on Planet’s future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of Planet’s Non-GAAP outlook to the most comparable GAAP measures is not available\nwithout unreasonable efforts.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 3\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nPLANET’S MISSION\nTo image the whole world\nevery day and make global\nchange visible, accessible,\nand actionable.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 4\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nThe Planet Opportunity\nUNIQUE\n+\nDaily, Global High Resolution\nDATA Scanning Tasking\nLARGE Agriculture Defense & Civil Technology\nIntelligence Government and Services\nADDRESSABLE\nMARKET\nNatural Resource Energy Finance Insurance\nManagement\nHIGHLY SCALABLE\nOne-to-Many Model\nBUSINESS MODEL\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 5\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nQ2 at a Glance\nRecent Highlights\n$61.1 M 58% ($4.4)M\n● Introductory Contract with NATO\nCommunications & Information\nAgency for the Alliance Persistent\nSurveillance from Space Program Record Revenue Non-GAAP Adjusted\n● Seven-figure SkySat Expansion in 2Q’25 Gross Margin(1) EBITDA(1)\nwith an International Government\nAgency in 2Q’25 in 2Q’25\n● Seven-figure Deal with an\nInternational Defense Customer,\n>90% 1,012 $249 M\nIncluding Pilot for Maritime\nDomain Awareness\n● Contract Expansion with BASF for\nField Boundaries Planetary Annual or Multi- EoP Customer Cash, Cash Equivalents,\nVariable on the xarvio® Platform and Short-Term\nYear Contracts Count(2)\n● Launch of Tanager-1 and 36 Investments\nSuperDoves Onboard a SpaceX EoP 2Q’25 EoP 2Q’25\nEoP 2Q’25\nLaunch Vehicle\nN 1 Not oe n: -P Gla An Ae Pt fih na as n a c F iais l c ma el tY re ica .r P ( lF eY a) s e en rd ei fn eg r tJ oa tn hu ea dry e fi3 n1. itions and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure at the end of this presentation. © Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 6\n2 Excludes customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self service paying users.

The New\nYork Times worked with Planet partner RAIC\nLabs, formerly known as Synthetaic, to analyze\nPlanet data and identify the locations of new\nvillages and check them against historical\nimages, state media, social media, and public\nrecords. The reporting included a collage of\nPlanet imagery demonstrating their findings\n(shown left).

The Company defines Non-GAAP Gross Margin as Non-GAAP Gross Profit divided by revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA: The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before the impact of interest income and expense, income tax expense and\ndepreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the following items: stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, non-operating income and\nexpenses such as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination.\nOther Key Metrics\nACV and EoP ACV Book of Business: In connection with the calculation of several of the key operational and business metrics we utilize, the Company calculates Annual\nContract Value (“ACV”) for contracts of one year or greater as the total amount of value that a customer has contracted to pay for the most recent 12 month period for the\ncontract, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. For short-term contracts (contracts less than 12 months), ACV is equal to total\ncontract value. The Company calculates EoP ACV Book of Business in connection with the calculation of several of the key operational and business metrics we utilize. The\nCompany defines EoP ACV Book of Business as the sum of the ACV of all contracts that are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of\nsuch contracts, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. Active contracts exclude any contract that has been canceled, expired prior to\nthe last day of the period without renewing, or for any other reason is not expected to generate revenue in the subsequent period. For contracts ending on the last day of the\nperiod, the ACV is either updated to reflect the ACV of the renewed contract or, if the contract has not yet renewed or extended, the ACV is excluded from the EoP ACV Book of\nBusiness. The Company does not annualize short-term contracts in calculating its EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company calculates the ACV of usage-based contracts based\non the committed contracted revenue or the revenue achieved on the usage-based contract in the prior 12-month period.\nPercent of Recurring ACV: Percent of Recurring ACV is the portion of the total EoP ACV Book of Business that is recurring in nature. The Company defines EoP ACV Book of\nBusiness as the sum of the ACV of all contracts that are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of such contracts, excluding\ncustomers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. The Company defines Percent of Recurring ACV as the dollar value of all data subscription contracts and\nthe committed portion of usage-based contracts (excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users) divided by the total dollar value of all\ncontracts in our EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company believes Percent of Recurring ACV is useful to investors to better understand how much of the Company’s revenue is\nfrom customers that have the potential to renew their contracts over multiple years rather than being one-time in nature. The Company tracks Percent of Recurring ACV to\ninform estimates for the future revenue growth potential of our business and improve the predictability of our financial results. There are no significant estimates underlying\nmanagement’s calculation of Percent of Recurring ACV, but management applies judgment as to which customers have an active contract at a period end for the purpose of\ndetermining EoP ACV Book of Business, which is used as part of the calculation of Percent of Recurring ACV.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 26\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nDefinitions\nEoP Customer Count: The Company defines EoP Customer Count as the total count of all existing customers at the end of the period excluding customers that are exclusively\nSentinel Hub self-service paying users. For EoP Customer Count, the Company defines existing customers as customers with an active contract with the Company at the end\nof the reported period. For the purpose of this metric, the Company defines a customer as a distinct entity that uses the Company’s data or services. The Company sells\ndirectly to customers, as well as indirectly through its partner network. If a partner does not provide the end customer’s name, then the partner is reported as the customer.\nEach customer, regardless of the number of active opportunities with the Company, is counted only once. For example, if a customer utilizes multiple products of Planet, the\nCompany only counts that customer once for purposes of EoP Customer Count. A customer with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries are also counted as a single\nunique customer based on the parent organization or parent account. For EoP Customer Count, the Company does not include users that only utilize the Company’s\nself-service Sentinel Hub web based ordering system, which the Company acquired in August 2023, and which offers standard starter packages on a monthly or annual basis.\nThe Company believes excluding these users from EoP Customer Count creates a more useful metric, as the Company views the Sentinel Hub starter packages as entry points\nfor smaller accounts, leading to broader awareness of the Company’s solutions throughout their networks and organizations. The Company believes EoP Customer Count is a\nuseful metric for investors and management to track as it is an important indicator of the broader adoption of the Company’s platform and is a measure of the Company’s\nsuccess in growing its market presence and penetration. Management applies judgment as to which customers are deemed to have an active contract in a period, as well as\nwhether a customer is a distinct entity that uses the Company’s data or services.\nCapital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue: The Company defines capital expenditures as purchases of property and equipment plus capitalized internally developed\nsoftware development costs, which are included in our statements of cash flows from investing activities. The Company defines Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of\nRevenue as the total amount of capital expenditures divided by total revenue in the reported period. Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue is a performance\nmeasure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support demand for the Company’s data services and related revenue, and to provide\na comparable view of the Company’s performance relative to other earth observation companies, which may invest significantly greater amounts in their satellites to deliver\ntheir data to customers. The Company uses an agile space systems strategy, which means we invest in a larger number of significantly lower cost satellites and software\ninfrastructure to automate the management of the satellites and to deliver the Company’s data to clients. As a result of the Company’s strategy and business model, the\nCompany’s capital expenditures may be more similar to software companies with large data center infrastructure costs. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to\nlook at the level of capital expenditure investments relative to revenue when evaluating the Company’s performance relative to other earth observation companies or to other\nsoftware and data companies with significant data center infrastructure investment requirements. The Company believes Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue is\na useful metric for investors because it provides visibility to the level of capital expenditures required to operate the Company and the Company’s relative capital efficiency.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 27\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nDefinitions\nNet Dollar Retention Rate: The Company defines Net Dollar Retention Rate as the percentage of ACV generated by existing customers in a given period as compared to the\nACV of all contracts at the beginning of the fiscal year from the same set of existing customers. The Company defines existing customers as customers with an active contract\nwith the Company. The Company believes Net Dollar Retention Rate is a useful metric for investors as it can be used to measure its ability to retain and grow revenue\ngenerated from its existing customers, on which its ability to drive long-term growth and profitability is, in part, dependent. The Company uses Net Dollar Retention Rate to\nassess customer adoption of new products, inform opportunities to make improvements across its products, identify opportunities to improve operations, and manage go to\nmarket functions, as well as to understand how much future growth may come from cross-selling and up-selling customers. Management applies judgment in determining\nthe value of active contracts in a given period, as set forth in the definition of ACV.\nNet Dollar Retention Rate including Winbacks: The Company assesses two metrics for net dollar retention–Net Dollar Retention Rate, as described above, and Net Dollar\nRetention Rate including winbacks. A winback is a previously existing customer that was inactive at the start of the measurement period but has reactivated during the\nmeasurement period. The reactivation period must be within 24 months from the last active contract with the customer; otherwise, the customer is counted as a new\ncustomer and therefore excluded from the retention rate metrics. The Company defines Net Dollar Retention Rate including winbacks as the percentage of ACV generated by\nexisting customers and winbacks in a given period as compared to the ACV of all contracts at the beginning of the fiscal year from the same set of existing customers. The\nCompany believes this metric is useful to investors as it captures the value of customer contracts that resume business with the Company after being inactive and thereby\nprovides a quantification of the Company’s ability to recapture lost business. Management uses this metric to understand the adoption of our products and long-term\ncustomer retention, as well as the success of marketing campaigns and sales initiatives in re-engaging inactive customers. Beyond the judgments underlying managements’\ncalculation of Net Dollar Retention Rate set forth above, there are no additional assumptions or estimates made in connection with Net Dollar Retention Rate including\nwinbacks.\n© Copyright 2024 Planet Labs PBC All Rights Reserved 28\nEARNINGS UPDATE\nMedia Credits\nSlide 10:\n● New York Times, August 10, China’s Great Wall of Villages.

The 6-figure deal is an expansion of the organization’s ongoing agreement with Planet, and will allow Global Fishing Watch to fully leverage PlanetScope data and Machine Learning (ML) to improve ocean stewardship and foster greater compliance and accountability across all maritime sectors. \n\nThe new contract represents a significant expansion of Global Fishing Watch’s PlanetScope monitoring coverage, providing 3-meter optical imagery spanning most of the world's coastlines. With this heightened capability, Global Fishing Watch aims to map small vessel activity across millions of square kilometers of the ocean as far from the shoreline as possible. This will allow the organization to greatly augment its ability to detect small vessels that are not using Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) or Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), enabling more accurate determination of fishing activities and better support for ocean governance efforts around the world. \n\n“Global Fishing Watch’s expanded collaboration with Planet will enable us to dramatically improve our capabilities to map the activities of smaller vessels close to shore, adding several million more previously untracked vessels to our platform,” explained Paul Woods, co-founder and chief innovation officer of Global Fishing Watch. “This brings us much closer to achieving our audacious goal of mapping all human activity at sea—for both the good of the ocean and the people whose livelihoods depend on healthy fisheries and marine ecosystems.” \n\nGlobal Fishing Watch uses AIS to track many vessels at sea. This GPS-based system is primarily a collision avoidance system, but can also be used to track vessels and determine if they are acting illegally. However, AIS is not required on many vessels, especially the millions of small fishing vessels around the world that are responsible for almost half of the global seafood catch. AIS can also be abused so as to broadcast false information. Because of this, Global Fishing Watch has turned to satellite imagery like PlanetScope to detect non-broadcasting vessels as well as those that are deliberately seeking to avoid detection. \n\nBy complementing insights generated by Global Fishing Watch’s tracking data, the imagery provided by Planet will help fuel analyses that enable monitoring, control and surveillance officers, policymakers, and fisheries managers to make better and more informed decisions about activities taking place in their waters. This increased transparency will not only help safeguard those on the front lines of maritime patrolling and enforcement, but will also help generate increased accountability into ocean activity around the world. \n\n“Through the growing capabilities and analysis made possible by EO imagery, Planet and our partners like GFW are proud to bring awareness and action to critical climate issues, including ocean conservation and transparency. We’re excited that this integration is just one of many leading examples of how ML and satellite data can help make meaningful strides in environmental conservation work,” said Planet Chief Impact Officer Andrew Zolli. “Whether it’s monitoring deforestation in the Amazon or illegal fishing in the Atlantic Ocean, Planet is committed to being a leader on the front line of climate solutions.” \n\nThe ongoing partnership between Global Fishing Watch and Planet embodies the organizations' commitment to improving the planet through transparency and innovation. The new and cutting-edge integration of PlanetScope data with Global Fishing Watch’s ML model will meaningfully improve Global Fishing Watch’s ability to identify vessels which are not broadcasting AIS signals – helping facilitate monitoring and enforcement efforts and creating a safer, healthier ocean for all. \n\n**About Planet**\n\nPlanet is a leading provider of global, daily satellite imagery and geospatial solutions.
