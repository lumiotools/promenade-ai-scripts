A vote to “withhold” will have no effect on the election of director nominees\nbecause the nominees who receive the highest number of “for” votes are elected, and since the nominees\nare running unopposed they only need a single “for” vote to be elected.\n(2) The advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers is not binding upon our\nBoard or the Compensation Committee of our Board. However, the Board and the Compensation\nCommittee will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions.\n(3) We are presenting the appointment of Weinberg & Company, P.A. to our stockholders for ratification.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board will consider the outcome of this vote in its future discussions\nregarding the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nQ: WHO COUNTS THE VOTES?\nA: Equiniti Trust Company, LLC has been appointed inspector of election by the Company and will tabulate votes at the\nAnnual Meeting.\nQ: DOES OUR BOARD RECOMMEND VOTING “FOR” THE PROPOSALS?\nA: Yes.

Your broker has enclosed or\notherwise provided a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker how to vote your shares. Your shares\nwill be voted as you indicate. Check the voting instruction card used by that organization to see if it offers internet or\ntelephone voting.\n4\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or nominee that you must\nfollow in order to submit your voting instructions and have your shares voted at the Annual Meeting.

A broker, banker or\nother nominee no longer has discretion to vote for or against the other proposals in this proxy statement which are\nconsidered non-routine matters. Accordingly, we encourage you to provide instructions to your brokerage firm on how to\nvote your shares.\nEven if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or voting instructions in advance\nof the Annual Meeting as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend or are unable\nto attend the Annual Meeting.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VOTING MATERIALS?\nA: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple\nproxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you\nmay receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares.

The Board proposes that all of the nominees listed below, each of whom\ncurrently serves on the Board, be elected as directors to serve for a term ending on the date of the next annual meeting of\nstockholders following the date such persons are elected as directors, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has approved and recommended for election as directors at the Annual\nMeeting the nominees described in this proxy statement.\nEach of the nominees has consented to serve if elected. If any of them becomes unavailable to serve as a director, the\nBoard may designate a substitute nominee. In that case, the persons named as proxies will vote for the substitute nominee\ndesignated by the Board. There are no family relationships between any director, executive officer, or person nominated or\nchosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer.\nName Age Position\nDon Hankey 81 Chairman of the Board of Directors\nBruce Stroever 74 Director\nSiddhesh Angle 40 Director\nRobert Gagnon 50 Director\nThe biographies and work experience of each of our nominees for directors is set forth below under “Directors and\nExecutive Officers.”\nVote Required and Recommendation of Board\nThe affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting is required for the election of directors.

This vote is intended to provide an overall assessment of our executive compensation\nprogram rather than focus on any specific item of compensation. The goal for our executive compensation program is to\nmotivate and retain highly-talented executives who are critical to the successful implementation of our strategic business plan.\nAt our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved that we hold this non-binding, advisory vote\non executive compensation every year. Our Board subsequently adopted this preference, and we are providing our stockholders\nwith a say-on-pay vote this year.\nWe invite you to consider the details of our executive compensation program provided in the tables and narrative\ndiscussion relating to the program. These will provide you with the individual elements of our compensation program and allow\nyou to view the trends in compensation for the years presented.\nWe request stockholder approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the\nSEC’s compensation disclosure rules, which disclosures include the compensation tables and the narrative discussion pertaining\nto compensation. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon our Board or us. However, we expect that our\nCompensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, will\nconsider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. Accordingly,\nwe are asking you to approve the following resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Bone Biologics Corporation, as\ndisclosed in the 2024 Proxy Statement of Bone Biologics Corporation pursuant to Item 402 of SEC\nRegulation S-K, including the compensation tables and narrative discussion, hereby is approved.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL, ON AN\nADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

(“MTF”). The Complaint alleged claims for breach of\ncontract against the Company and tortious interference with contract against the Individual Defendants and MTF arising from\nthe termination of the Professional Service Agreements, dated as of January 8, 2016, between the Company and each of the\nPlaintiffs. The Individual Defendants were sued for actions taken by them in connection with their service to the Company as\ndirectors and/or officers of the Company. As such, we have certain indemnification obligations to the Individual Defendants.\nOn January 10, 2024 we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release (the “Agreement”) with\nthe Plaintiffs on the one hand, and the Company and LaNeve on the other hand, in settlement of the claims for breach of contract\nand tortious interference with contract. The Agreement is effective as of January 9, 2024.\nUnder the Agreement, the Company agreed to pay the plaintiffs $750,000, and on February 7, 2024, the Company\npaid $414,989, and the Company’s insurance carrier paid $335,011 for the total settlement.\nIn the normal course of our business, we may periodically become subject to various lawsuits. However, except as\nnoted above, there are currently no legal actions pending against us or, to our knowledge, are any such proceedings\ncontemplated.\n12\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOur Board consists of four (4) members: Don Hankey, Bruce Stroever, Sid Angle, and Robert Gagnon. The Board\nmet four times during 2023.\nDirector Independence\nThe listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) require that a majority of our Board be\nindependent. No director will qualify as independent unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no\nrelationship with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a\ndirector. Based upon the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules and regulations, our board has determined that each\nof Sid Angle, Robert Gagnon and Bruce Stroever are independent and that Erick Lucera, who resigned from our board effective\nJanuary 8, 2024, was independent during his service on the Board of Directors.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board believes it is important to select the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the manner it\nconsiders in the best interests of the Company at any given time. The Board has elected a Chairman of the Board who is\ndifferent from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Board currently includes three individuals who are independent from the management of the Company. The Board\nand its committees meet regularly throughout the year to assure that the independent directors are well briefed and informed\nwith regard to the Company’s affairs. Independent directors have unfettered access to any employee within the Company and\nare encouraged to call upon whatever employee he deems fit to secure the information each director feels is important to their\nunderstanding of our Company. In this fashion, we seek to maintain well informed, independent directors who are prepared to\nmake informed decisions regarding our business affairs.\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the Board as a whole\nplays an important role in overseeing the identification, assessment and mitigation of such risks. The Board reviews information\nregarding the Company’s finances and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. For example, the oversight of\nfinancial risk management lies primarily with the Board’s Audit Committee, which is empowered to appoint and oversee our\nindependent auditors, monitor the integrity of our financial reporting processes and systems of internal controls and provide an\navenue of communication among our independent auditors, management and the Board. The Company’s Compensation\nCommittee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company’s compensation plans and\narrangements. Our Board administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function directly. In fulfilling its risk oversight\nresponsibility, the Board, as a whole and acting through any established committees, regularly consults with management to\nevaluate and, when appropriate, modify our risk management strategies.\nBoard Committees\nOur Board has appointed an audit committee, nominating and corporate governance committee, and compensation\ncommittee. The table below shows the number of meetings held by our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee during fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) and the\nnames of the directors who are currently serving on each committee.\nNumber of\nCommittee Name Meetings Held Committee Members\nAudit 2(2) Bruce Stroever\nRobert Gagnon (1)\nSid Angle\nCompensation 0(3) Bruce Stroever (1)\nRobert Gagnon\nSid Angle\nNominating and Corporate Governance 0(4) Bruce Stroever\nCommittee Robert Gagnon\nSid Angle (1)\n(1) Committee Chair\n13\n(2) The Audit Committee acted by unanimous written consent 4 times in fiscal year 2023.\n(3) The Compensation Committee acted by unanimous written consent 2 times in fiscal year 2023.\n(4) The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee acted by unanimous written consent 2 times in\nfiscal year 2023.\nEach committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by our Board.

The Board has determined that each\nmember of the Audit Committee meets the independence and financial literacy requirements applicable to audit committee\nmembers under the Nasdaq listing standards and SEC rules.

In its assessment of each potential candidate, the Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee considers, among other things, each candidate’s experience, qualifications, attributes,\ndiversity and skills in light of the Company’s business, structure and current needs of the Board. Stockholders may recommend\ncandidates for Nominating and Governance Committee consideration by submitting such recommendation using the method\ndescribed under “Communications with the Board.” Stockholders may also nominate director candidates in accordance with\nour Bylaws as described under “2025 Annual Meeting ⸻ Stockholder Nominations of Directors.”\nBoard (and Committee) Meetings and Attendance\nFor fiscal year 2023, each of our directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board,\nand the committee(s) of the Board on which he serves. Each director is expected to attend and participate in, either in person\nor by means of telephonic or video conference, all scheduled meetings of the Board and all meetings of the committees of the\nBoard on which such director serves, and all scheduled meetings of stockholders of the Company.

This reduction was influenced\nby a bonus awarded when the Company fully resumed operations in 2022 after scaling back during most of 2021 due to limited\ncapital resources. Additionally, in 2023, the PEO received a cash bonus of $25,000 and was granted 25,000 stock options.\nSimilarly, the compensation paid to non-PEO NEOs decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, also attributable to the bonus granted\nduring the Company’s full resumption of operations in 2022 after scaling back in 2021 due to limited capital resources.\nCompensation actually paid to the PEO increased by $116,750 in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to the Company fully\nresuming operations in 2022 after scaling back operations during most of 2021 as a result of limited capital resources. In 2022,\nour PEO was paid a cash bonus of $37,750 and was granted 158 stock options. In 2021, our PEO was not paid a cash bonus\nand was not granted any stock options. Compensation actually paid to the non-PEO NEOs increased in 2022 as compared to\n2021, as Ms. Walsh, our Chief Financial Officer, became a full-time employee in 2022.\nThe information provided above under the “Pay Versus Performance” heading will not be deemed to be incorporated by\nreference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such\nfiling, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates such information by reference.\n20\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nAs a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act, we are providing the following director compensation\ninformation in accordance with the scaled disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K.\nThe following table shows information regarding the compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2023\nby the members of our Board.\nFees Earned or\nName Paid in Cash Option Awards(1) Total\nBruce Stroever ................................................................... $ 30,000 $ 46,883 $ 76,883\nDon Hankey(2) .................................................................... - - -\nErick Lucera(3) ................................................................... 30,000 46,883 76,883\nSid Angle ........................................................................... 30,000 46,883 76,883\n(1) The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options under FASB ASC Topic 718, which\nwas determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions disclosed in our consolidated financial\nstatements to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

No compensation paid per our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy.\n(3) Resigned effective January 8, 2024.\nThe Board adopted a Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (the “Director Compensation Policy”) as follows:\nAnnual Cash Compensation\nEach member of the Board who (i) is an independent director under applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules, except that the\namount of compensation as referred to in the Nasdaq Rule 5605 shall not exceed $10,000 per year and/or (ii) does not\nbeneficially own, or is not a director or executive officer of an entity which beneficially owns, 5% or more of the Company’s\nCommon Stock (each such member an, “Independent Director”) will receive compensation set forth below for service on the\nBoard. The annual cash compensation amounts will be payable in equal quarterly installments, in arrears following the end of\neach quarter in which the service occurred, pro-rated for any partial months of service. All annual cash fees are vested upon\npayment.\n1. Annual Board Service Retainer:\na. All Independent Directors other than the Board Chair: $25,000\nb.

All stock options granted under this Director Compensation Policy will be Nonstatutory Stock Options (as\ndefined in the Plan), with a term of ten years from the date of grant and an exercise price per share equal to 100% of the Fair\nMarket Value (as defined in the Plan) of the underlying Common Stock of the Company on the date of grant.\n(a) Automatic Equity Grants.\n(i) Initial Grant for New Directors. Without any further action of the Board, each person who, after the\neffective date of the Director Compensation Policy, is elected or appointed for the first time to be an Independent Director will\nautomatically, upon the date of his or her initial election or appointment to be an Independent Director, be granted a\nNonstatutory Stock Option to purchase 9 shares of Common Stock (the “Initial Grant”), regardless of when such person is\nelected or appointed to the Board. Each Initial Grant will fully vest on the date of the annual meeting of the stockholders of the\nCompany next following the Initial Grant.\n(ii) Annual Grant. Without any further action of the Board, at the close of business on the date of each\nannual meeting of stockholders following the effective date of the Director Compensation Policy, each person who is then an\nIndependent Director will automatically be granted to a Nonstatutory Stock Option to purchase a number of shares of Common\nStock having an option value (calculated on the date of grant) of $50,000 (the “Annual Grant”). Each Annual Grant will vest\nin a series of four successive equal quarterly installments over the one-year period measure from the date of grant.\n(iii) Pro-rated Annual Grant. If a person is elected or appointed to the Board at a time other than at the\nannual stockholder meeting, then on the date of such election or appointment, the person will be automatically, and without\nfurther action by the Board, granted an Annual Grant covering a pro-rated number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the\nDirector Compensation Policy.\n22\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nIn connection with our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Audit Committee has:\n(1) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management; (2) discussed with the independent registered\npublic accounting firm (the “Auditors”) the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC; and (3) received the written disclosures and the letter from the Auditors\nrequired by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the Auditors’\ncommunications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the Auditors their independence.\nBased on the review and discussions referred to in items (1) through (3) of the above paragraph, the Audit Committee\nrecommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\nRobert Gagnon, Chair\nBruce Stroever\nSid Angle\n23\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nNone of the following persons has any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction to which we are a party or\nin any proposed transaction to which we are proposed to be a party since January 1, 2022:\n● Any of our directors or officers;\n● Any proposed nominee for election as our director;\n● Any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to\nour Common Stock; or\n● Any relative or spouse of any of the foregoing persons, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same house as such\nperson or who is a director or officer of any parent or subsidiary of our Company.\nReview, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons\nDue to the small size of our Company, we do not at this time have a formal written policy regarding the review of\nrelated party transactions, and rely on our full Board to review, approve or ratify such transactions and identify and prevent\nconflicts of interest. Our Board reviews any such transaction in light of the particular affiliation and interest of any involved\ndirector, officer or other employee or stockholder and, if applicable, any such person’s affiliates or immediate family members.\nManagement aims to present transactions to our Board for approval before they are entered into or, if that is not possible, for\nratification after the transaction has occurred. If our Board finds that a conflict of interest exists, then it will determine the\nappropriate action or remedial action, if any. Our Board approves or ratifies a transaction if it determines that the transaction is\nconsistent with our best interests and the best interest of our stockholders.\n24\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten\npercent of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of\nchanges in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten\npercent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us during the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten percent\nbeneficial owners were complied with except with respect to Messrs.

If the proposal is in compliance\nwith all of the requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, we will include the stockholder proposal in our\nproxy statement and place it on the form of proxy issued for the 2025 annual meeting. Stockholder proposals submitted for\ninclusion in our proxy materials should be mailed to the following address: Bone Biologics Corporation, Attention: Corporate\nSecretary, 2 Burlington Woods Drive, Suite 100, Burlington, MA 01803.\nStockholder Proposals for Consideration at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but not for Inclusion in the Proxy\nMaterials.\nPursuant to our Bylaws, items of business that are proposed outside of the process pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the\nExchange Act as described above, may properly be brought before the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders only if we receive\nnotice of such business no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the previous\nyear’s annual meeting. Thus, for the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, we must receive notice of business that is not\nsubmitted for inclusion in our proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act between May 20, 2025 and June\n19, 2025. The notice must be in accordance with and contain all information provided for in our Bylaws and such business\nmust be a proper matter for stockholder action under the General Corporation Law of Delaware. We will not permit business\nthat does not comply with the foregoing notice requirement to be brought before the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders.\nStockholder business that is not submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 should be mailed to the\nfollowing address: Bone Biologics Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 2 Burlington Woods Drive, Suite 100,\nBurlington, MA 01803.

This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra\nconvenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nThis year, a number of brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders will be “householding” the\nCompany’s proxy materials. A single Notice and Access Card will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker\nthat they will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise\nor until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to\nreceive a separate Notice and Access Card, please notify your broker or the Company. Direct your written request to Bone\nBiologics Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 2 Burlington Woods Drive, Ste 100, Burlington, MA 01803 and oral\nrequests may be made by calling the Company at (781) 552-4452 and we will promptly deliver a separate copy. Stockholders\nwho currently receive multiple copies of the Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials at their addresses and would\nlike to request “householding” of their communications should contact their brokers.\n27\nOTHER MATTERS\nManagement does not intend to present any other items of business and knows of no other matters that will be brought\nbefore the Annual Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please sign and date the enclosed proxy\ncard.\n28\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis proxy statement and materials delivered with this proxy statement, including our 2023 Annual Report, contains\n“forward-looking” statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this proxy statement and\nmaterials delivered with this proxy statement, including, without limitation, statements regarding our financial position,\nbusiness strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations and capital expenditures, are forward-looking\nstatements.

One of our core values is “Do the Right Thing.” As\nyour CEO, I would like all members of our team to understand that our commitment to\nexcel at what we do must not come at the expense of maintaining integrity and ethics. We\neach have the individual and collective responsibility to comply with the laws,\nregulations, policies and codes covering our business and ourselves, and this includes\nboth following the spirit of these as well as their literal terms. I urge you to review this\nCode of Conduct and Ethics carefully and apply the principles and rules everyday as you\ngo about your job duties. We each have a responsibility to raise any concerns we should\nhave any decisions or practices that might conflict with this Code of Conduct and Ethics.\nYou have my commitment and reassurance that there will be no retaliation as result of\nyou raising any such concerns.\nSincerely,\nStephen R. LaNeve, CEO\nCovered Individuals\nBone Biologics Corporation, together with its subsidiary Bone Biologics, Inc. (“Bone” or\nthe “Company”) is committed to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business. This\nCode of Conduct and Ethics (herein referred to as the “Code”) has been adopted by the\nBoard of Directors and applies to all directors, officers, full and part time employees,\ntemporary workers, contract workers and consultants. The Code provides a general\nstatement of the expectations to which these persons should adhere while acting on behalf\nof Bone in the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace. It does\nnot, and cannot, cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic guidance principles\nthat you should apply.\nEthical Standards\nYou are personally accountable for following these principles in performing your work\non behalf of Bone:\n• Basing decisions and actions on honesty, fairness, integrity and fact;\n• Understanding and conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws\nand this Code;\n• Treating all employees, contract workers, customers, vendors and suppliers in an\nhonest and fair manner;\n• Not participating in or tolerating unlawful activity, fraud, deceit or concealment;\n• Avoiding situations where personal interests are, or appear to be, in conflict with\n2\nCompany interests;\n• Safeguarding and properly using Company proprietary information, assets and\nresources;\n• Maintaining confidentiality of non-public information and not acting on such\ninformation for personal gain; and\n• Adhering to all applicable Bone policies and standards.\nCompliance Program and Leadership\nCompliance with applicable laws and this Code is of the highest importance. In order to\nfoster, ensure and monitor compliance, Bone has adopted policies, training programs and\nmechanisms to promote an atmosphere of open, honest and ethical communication\nthroughout the Company, periodic audits to monitor compliance, investigations of\nalleged non-compliance, and responses to detected offenses (in totality these make up the\n“Compliance Program”). However, compliance with this Code is the responsibility of\neach covered individual (see above). The officer authorized to oversee compliance with\nthis Code is the General Counsel, or in the absence of such person, the Chief Financial\nOfficer.\nThe compliance officer’s responsibility is to ensure communication, training, monitoring,\nand overall compliance with the Code. Together with the Company’s officers, directors\nand managers, the compliance officer will have the responsibility of fostering an\natmosphere where employees are comfortable with communicating and reporting\nconcerns and possible Code violations. Managers are the “go to” persons for employee\nquestions and concerns relating to the Code. Managers or supervisors will immediately\nreport any violations or allegations of violations to the compliance officer. Managers will\nwork with the compliance officer in assessing areas of concern, potential violations, any\nneeds for enhancement of the Code or remedial actions to effect the Code’s policies and\noverall compliance with the Code and other related policies. The compliance officer\nreports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, and has the authority and an open channel\nto report directly to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of\nDirectors.\nCompliance with Laws, Regulations, Policies and Guidelines\nYou must comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all Company\nPolicies applicable to your activities on behalf of Bone. Copies of all Company policies\nmay be found on the Company’s Headquarters. If a law or regulation conflicts with a\nCompany policy or this Code, you must comply with the law or regulation; however, if a\nlocal custom or policy conflicts with a Company Policy or this Code, you must comply\nwith the Code. Compliance with laws, regulations, company policy and other applicable\nguidelines is critical to Bone’s professionalism and corporate success. Although these\nlaws, regulations, policies and guidelines can be complex, effective compliance is\nessential to Bone’s business operations. If there are any questions about these conflicts,\nyou should ask your supervisor or the compliance officer how to handle the situation. In\n3\nthe section below, some of the most important laws and guidelines that govern Bone’s\nbusiness are outlined:\n• Federal and State Anti-Kickback Statutes - Anti-kickback (AKS) laws prohibit\nanyone from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value (including\na kickback, bribe, or rebate) in return for referring an individual for an item or\nservice reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Violations of the\nlaws can lead to severe penalties including: criminal and/or civil fines for the\nCompany, individual employees, and the healthcare professionals involved in an\nimproper arrangement, and/or imprisonment.\n• Federal and State False Claims Acts - The Federal False Claims Act (FCA) and\nsimilar state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims or\ninformation for payment or approval to federal or state government and healthcare\nprograms. Violations of these laws include providing false information to\ncustomers related to coding, pricing, or submission of claims for government\nprograms and the promotion of products for unapproved uses.\n• Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code –\nPhRMA has issued the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare\nProfessionals (herein referred to as the “PhRMA Code”). This voluntary code for\nmember companies focuses on interactions between pharmaceutical company\nrepresentatives and healthcare professionals. The Code provides guidance on\nmarketing medicines to healthcare professionals and developing relationships\nfocused on, among other things, informing healthcare professionals about\nproducts, providing scientific and educational information, supporting medical\nresearch and education, making charitable donations, entering into research\nagreements and consulting agreements, authoring publications, and providing\ngifts and entertainment.\n• Drug Laws. Bone is committed to maintaining the highest standards of product\nquality and safety. Careful attention to product quality has a direct and substantial\neffect on Bone’s reputation and performance and allows the Company to meet or\nexceed customers’ expectations. Bone’s operations and products are subject to\nextensive and rigorous regulatory regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"FFDCA\"). Employees must follow all regulatory\nrequirements that relate to research, development, manufacture, testing, storage,\nlabeling, marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Bone’s products.\nInteractions of professional sales, medical affairs and other personnel with\nhealthcare professionals are intended to provide valuable product information to\nthe professional, thereby benefiting patients and enhancing the practice of\nmedicine. Specific elements embodied in appropriate and responsible promotion\nof products include, but are not limited to:\n• Adhering to FDA-approved labeling;\n• Promoting products within the scope of the FDA-approved indications;\n• Training and validation of professional sales, medical affairs and other\npersonnel; and\n• Providing balanced information addressing product benefits and risks;\n4\n• Educating patients, healthcare professionals and our employees about the\nappropriate use of the applicable product(s);\n• Training, testing, monitoring and auditing relevant Company employees,\nincluding our field sales personnel; and\n• Reporting adverse events relating to a Bone product: Employees who\nbecome aware of an adverse event; whether or not the patient, healthcare\nprofessionals or clinical investigator believe that the adverse event and/or\nthe effect of it are directly related to a Bone product, must report it as\nfollows:\n• Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA). PDMA was enacted\nto address certain prescription drug marketing practices that have\ncontributed to the diversion of large quantities of drugs into a secondary\ngrey market. These marketing practices, including the distribution of\nfree samples, the use of coupons redeemable for drugs at no cost or low\ncost and the sale of deeply discounted drugs to hospitals and health care\nentities, have helped fuel a multi-million dollar drug diversion market\nthat provides a portal through which mislabeled, sub- potent,\nadulterated, expired and counterfeit drugs are able to enter the nation's\ndrug distribution system.\n• Securities Laws. The U.S. Federal and State securities laws prohibit the\nuse of material, non-public information in connection with the\npurchase or sale of securities. Employees, officers and directors are\nforbidden from using or disclosing material, non-public information\nthat they acquire during the course of their employment with the\nCompany. Material information is information that an average investor\nmight consider important when deciding whether to buy, sell or hold\nsecurities. All Bone employees must adhere to the Company’s Insider\nTrading Policy. If you have any questions regarding the above or the\nCompany’s Insider Trading Policy, please contact the Company’s\nGeneral Counsel.\n• Disclosure. It is imperative that all disclosure in documents filed by\nBone with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or in other\npublic communications by Bone is full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable. All officers, directors and employees must take all steps\nnecessary to assist Bone in fulfilling these responsibilities, consistent\nwith each person’s role in the Company. Employees should give prompt,\naccurate answers to all inquiries in connection with Bone’s preparation\nof public disclosures and reports. Bone is required under the federal\nsecurities laws to avoid the selective disclosure of material non-public\ninformation. Bone has established procedures for releasing material\ninformation in a manner that is designed to achieve broad dissemination\nof the information immediately upon its release. Employees should not,\ntherefore, disclose material information to anyone outside the Company,\nincluding family members and friends, other than in accordance with\nthose established procedures. Any inquiries or requests from outsiders\n(including securities analysts, investors, media, etc.) regarding material\nnon- public information about the Company should be forwarded to\n5\nauthorized spokespersons of the Company as detailed in the Insider\nTrading Policy.\n• Antitrust Laws. It is Bone’s policy to compete fairly and legitimately\nand to comply with applicable antitrust and competition laws. The\nantitrust laws prohibit agreements or actions that may restrain trade or\nreduce competition and are designed to ensure businesses are competing\nfairly. Violations of antitrust laws may include agreements or\nunderstandings between Bone and its competitors to fix or control\nprices, terms or conditions of sale; to boycott specified suppliers or\ncustomers; to allocate products, territories or markets; or to limit the\nproduction or sale of products. Employees must exercise special care\nand take reasonable measures to ensure that any activities undertaken\nwith representatives of other companies are not viewed and would not\nbe construed as violations of antitrust law.\n• The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) – The FCPA provides\nspecific laws on conducting business with foreign government officials.\nUnder this Act, a company (and its directors, agents, officers and\nemployees) is prohibited from directly or indirectly offering,\npromising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or\nanything of value to a foreign government official to win or retain\nbusiness or favorable treatment. In addition, the FCPA requires Bone to\nkeep accurate books and records and maintain an adequate system of\ninternal accounting controls.\n• UK Anti-Bribery Act – The UK-Anti Bribery Act prohibits crimes of\nbribery such as being bribed or bribing another person, the bribery of\nforeign public officials, and the failure of a commercial organization to\nprevent bribery on its behalf.\n• Environmental Laws – Governments at all levels and in many countries\nhave enacted very strict laws for the protection of the environment.\nEnforcement authorities have shown a strong tendency to enforce\ncriminal laws against corporations and their employees for serious\nenvironmental offenses. Of course, we also want to do our part to\npreserve our environment. You must exercise good judgment with\nregard to the environmental aspects of our use of buildings and real\nestate, our laboratory processes and our products. You must comply\nwith all applicable environmental laws and with all permits and\napprovals granted to the Company by environmental regulatory\nauthorities. You should take effort to reduce or eliminate the creation of\nwaste at the source, to promote the recycling of waste material and to\ndispose of any remaining waste material in accordance with applicable\nenvironmental laws.\nConflicts of Interest\nYou should avoid situations in which your personal, family or financial interests\nconflict or even appear to conflict with those of Bone or compromise its interests.\nYou should handle all actual or apparent conflicts of interest between your\npersonal and professional relationships in an honest and ethical manner. Conflicts\n6\nare not always clear-cut. A “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private\ninterest interferes in any way with the interests of the Company. A conflict\nsituation can arise when an employee, officer or director takes action or has\ninterests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work\nobjectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee,\nofficer or director, or a member of his or her family, receives personal benefits as a\nresult of his or her position in the Company. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations\nof, employees and their family members may create conflicts of interest.\nIt is almost always a conflict of interest for a Company employee to work simultaneously\nfor a competitor, customer or supplier. You are not allowed to work for a competitor as a\nconsultant or board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business\nconnection with our customers, suppliers or competitors, except on the Company’s\nbehalf. In addition, employees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for\nthemselves personally any opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate\nproperty, information or position, except with the consent of the Board of Directors.\nEmployees, officers and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate\ninterests when the opportunity to do so arises. If you become aware of a conflict or\npotential conflict of interest, contact your own supervisor or the compliance officer for\nfurther guidance. Should an actual conflict of interest arise between the personal,\nprofessional or financial duties of an employee, the employee involved in this conflict of\ninterest should address, disclose and handle the matter in the utmost ethical manner and\nin accordance with this Code.\nInteractions with Healthcare Professionals\nAppropriate and ethical relationships with healthcare professionals are an essential\nbusiness component to any pharmaceutical company. A critical element of this\nrelationship is ensuring that healthcare professionals have the most accurate information\navailable in regards to prescription medicines. These interactions should be conducted in\na fair and ethical manner to ensure that purchasing or prescribing decisions are made\nobjectively, and not on the basis of a financial relationship. As such, Bone expects all\nemployees to conduct themselves in the most appropriate and compliant manner when\ninteracting with healthcare professionals. Because healthcare professionals are subject to\nspecific laws and regulations, when interacting with healthcare professionals, all\nemployees shall abide by applicable laws and applicable Bone policies. See above, under\n“Compliance with Laws, Regulations, Policies and Guidelines” and also Bone policies\non the Company Headquarters.\nWork Environment\n• Nondiscrimination. The Company is committed to a policy of complying with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws prohibiting unlawful considerations of race,\nreligion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability,\nmarital status or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal\nlaws. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to,\nhiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, discipline and\ntermination. You must follow all applicable governmental laws and Company policies.\n7\nOur goal is to establish and maintain a work environment free from discrimination and\nharassment of any kind. Bone is committed to fostering open communication throughout\nthe organization to resolve any questions, concerns, problems or complaints, including\nthose involving discrimination or harassment.\n• Safety. Bone is committed to providing a work environment that strives to protect\nemployee health and safety. At the same time, health and safety are important\naspects of job performance. In addition, there are extensive local and national\nlaws designed to promote a safe workplace. These laws are strictly enforced.\nEmployees have a responsibility to learn the safety procedures applicable to their\njobs and to follow them. Employees must remain aware of risks in the workplace\nand try to reduce these risks. If needed, advice and guidance from the Legal\nDepartment or Human Resources can be provided.\n• Privacy. The internet and globalization have led to a shrinking world in which\npublic attention on the protection of an individual’s privacy is ever-increasing.\nWe advocate maintaining the privacy of an individual’s personal information.\nAccordingly, all Bone employees must comply with all applicable laws and\nregulations addressing privacy, including the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and applicable state and foreign laws.\nConfidential Information\nBone employees have an ethical obligation to safeguard all Bone confidential and\nproprietary information. Confidential Information includes, but shall not be\nlimited to:\n• Unpublished financial information including, but not limited to, financial models,\nsales and revenue information and pre-launch information;\n• Project status, business development discussions, collaborations, inventions,\ntrade- secrets, know-how;\n• Operational and/or marketing plans, systems, techniques, information and\nbudgets;\n• Personal information including, but not limited to, salary, wage and benefits\ninformation;\n• Customer information and requirements;\n• Patient Information (i.e. individually identifiable health information such as name,\naddress, birth date, Social Security Number); and\n• Information pertaining to Bone’ relationship with other businesses, incuding\nexisting or potential strategic partners, suppliers, distributors, consultants and any\nother information that is not publicly available.\nEmployees are responsible for maintaining the privacy of business activities,\noperations and intelligence. Confidential Information should not be used for\npersonal uses. This Confidential Information is entrusted to employees in\nconjunction with the employee’s roles and responsibilities and may be distributed\nin connection with a confidentiality agreement. Employees with access to\nConfidential Information should take reasonable care to keep this information\n8\nprivate and confidential and must not discuss Confidential Information with any\nunauthorized recipients. Unauthorized recipients are those individuals who do not\nhave a business need to know the Confidential Information or are seeking\nConfidential Information without the presence of a signed confidentiality\nagreement, as well as a valid business explanation for obtaining the information.\nCompetitive Intelligence\nIt is entirely proper for the Company to gather information about its marketplace,\nincluding information about competitors and their products and services. However, there\nare limits to the ways that information can be acquired and used, especially information\nabout competitors. Any form of illegal activity pertaining to acquiring a competitor’s\nconfidential information will not be tolerated. Obtaining a competitor’s confidential, non-\npublic information through unlawful practices is prohibited. The improper gathering or\nuse of competitive information could subject the Company and the employee to criminal\nand civil liability. When in doubt as to whether a source of information is proper, an\nemployee should contact the Legal Department.\nCompany Assets\nEmployees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use for\nlegitimate business purposes. It is imperative that all employees exercise proper measures\nto ensure reasonable care, as theft, carelessness and waste pertaining to company assets\nmay be harmful to the Company’s financial status, business operations, and profitability.\nThe use of Company assets for any unlawful or improper purpose, including use that\nderives a personal benefit for the employee, is strictly prohibited. This includes the use of\nthe Company's telephone system, other electronic communication services, written\nmaterials and other property other than primarily for business-related purposes. Further,\nemployees report any actual or suspected theft, damage or misuse of property his or her\nmanager and/or another member of senior management immediately.\nReporting of Violations\nIf an employee becomes aware of suspected misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, abuse of\nBone assets or violations of the standards in this Code by an officer, director, employee\nor contract worker which they believe in good faith is a potential violation of this Code,\nthat employee is responsible for reporting such matters to their manager or the Company’s\ncompliance officer immediately. Employees should also report any complaint\nor concern regarding Bone’s accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters,\nor any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\nSupervisors are required to refer all reports of possible violations to the compliance\nofficer. If an employee believes that their compliance report was given insufficient\nattention, they should report the matter to higher levels of management such as to the\nChief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel or the Chair of\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee.\n9\nInvestigations\nBone is committed to evaluating and confidentially investigating all reported concerns in a\ntimely manner. The compliance officer will oversee the conduct of investigations,\nrecommend corrective or disciplinary action as necessary, and report investigative\noutcomes to the appropriate parties. All employees are obligated to cooperate with\ninvestigational efforts, including by being truthful in response to inquiries. In response to\nevery report regarding potential violations of the Code which is made in good faith, Bone\nwill undertake an effective and thorough investigation, and if improper conduct is found,\nBone will take appropriate disciplinary and remedial action. Bone will attempt to keep its\ndiscussions with any person reporting a violation confidential to the extent reasonably\npossible, without compromising the effectiveness of the investigation. If you believe your\nreport is not properly explained or resolved, you may take your concern or complaint to\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. When an alleged\nviolation of the Code is reported, the Company shall take prompt and appropriate action in\naccordance with the law and regulations and otherwise consistent with good business\npractice. If the suspected violation appears to involve either a possible violation of law or\nan issue of significant corporate interest, or if the report involves a complaint or concern\nof any person, whether employee, a stockholder or other interested person regarding the\nCompany’s financial disclosure, internal accounting controls, questionable auditing or\naccounting matters or practices or other issues relating to the Company’s accounting or\nauditing, then the manager or investigator should immediately notify the compliance\nofficer, who, in turn, shall notify the Chair of either the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee and/or the Audit Committee. If a suspected violation involves any director or\nexecutive officer, or if the suspected violation concerns any fraud, whether or not\nmaterial, involving management or other employees who have a significant role in the\nCompany’s internal controls, any person who received such report should immediately\nreport the alleged violation to the compliance officer and, in every such case, the Chair of\nthe Audit Committee. The compliance officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as\napplicable, shall assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action,\nincluding the conduct of an investigation, as appropriate.\nPolicy Against Non-retaliation\nBone will not allow any retribution, retaliation, or discipline of any employee for making\na good-faith report of a suspected violation. Employees and contract workers are\nprotected by law from retaliation for reporting possible violations of this Code or for\nparticipating in procedures connected with an investigation, proceeding or hearing\nconducted by Bone or a government agency with respect to such complaints. Bone will\ntake disciplinary action, up to and including, the immediate termination of any employee\nor contract worker who retaliates against another employee or contract worker for\nreporting any of these alleged activities.\nHowever, any employee who deliberately makes a false accusation with the purpose of\nharming or retaliating against another employee, or who fails to report a matter of\nnoncompliance, will be subject to disciplinary action. Bone will promptly initiate an\n10\ninvestigation of the reported concern after receiving the compliance hotline call or report.\nEmployees must keep in mind, however, that Bone may be unable to effectively and\nthoroughly investigate concerns unless additional information is provided.\nAccess and Training\nThe Company shall ensure that employees, officers and directors may access the Code on\nthe Company’s website.

In addition to imposing discipline upon employees involved in\nnon-compliant conduct, the Company also will impose discipline, as appropriate, upon an\nemployee’s supervisor, if any, who directs or approves such employees’ improper actions,\nor is aware of those actions but does not act appropriately to correct them, and upon\nother individuals who fail to report known noncompliant conduct. In addition to imposing\nits own discipline, the Company will bring any violations of law to the attention of\nappropriate law enforcement personnel.
