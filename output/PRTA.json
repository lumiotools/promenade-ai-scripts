Net loss per share was $1.10 and $1.20 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to a net income per share on a diluted basis of $0.38 and a net loss per share of $1.50 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. \n\nProthena reported total revenue of $1.0 million and $133.0 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to total revenue of $84.9 million and $91.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily from collaboration revenue from Bristol Myers Squibb as compared to total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 that was also primarily from collaboration revenue from Bristol Myers Squibb. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses totaled $50.7 million and $172.3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to $57.9 million and $158.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses for the third quarter compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to lower manufacturing expenses. The increase in R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses and higher personnel related expenses; offset in part by lower manufacturing and other R&D expenses. R&D expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $5.1 million and $16.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to $4.9 million and $14.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. \n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $16.8 million and $50.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to $16.6 million and $44.9 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily related to higher personnel related expenses. G&A expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $5.9 million and $19.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to $6.0 million and $15.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. \n\nTotal non-cash share-based compensation expense was $11.0 million and $35.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to $10.9 million and $29.8 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Prothena had $520.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and no debt. \n\nAs of November 6, 2024, Prothena had approximately 53.8 million ordinary shares outstanding. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company continues to expect full year 2024 net cash used in operating and investing actives to be $148 to $160 million and expects to end the year with approximately $468 million (midpoint) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The estimated full year 2024 net cash used from operating and investing activities is primarily driven by an estimated net loss of $120 to $135 million, which includes an estimated $48 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense. \n\n**About Prothena**\n\nProthena Corporation plc is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company with expertise in protein dysregulation and a pipeline of investigational therapeutics with the potential to change the course of devastating neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases.

During his tenure, Hideki helped to create a robust clinical foundation and set Prothena on a path for future success.” \n\n“I am extremely proud of my time at Prothena, building and strengthening our clinical and medical operations in support of our many potential best-in-class therapeutics. Having recruited and worked with Chad over the past two years, I have full confidence in our succession plan and his ability to lead Prothena as Chief Development Officer,” said Dr. Garren. “I believe the upcoming meaningful clinical readouts, across multiple Prothena programs during the next nine months and beyond, have the potential to be transformational for millions of patients and their families across a wide range of unmet medical needs. I have enjoyed my time and benefited from working alongside Prothenians who have contributed to an industry leading R&D pipeline. Prothena’s scientific expertise in protein dysregulation is unmatched in the industry.” \n\nDr. Swanson is a neuropharmacologist with over 20 years industry experience and joined Prothena as Senior Vice President and Head of Clinical Development in January 2023 from Eisai, Inc. where he was the Executive Director of Clinical Research in the Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Health group. In that role, he served as the International Project Team Leader, responsible for all aspects of the lecanemab program. During his 11-year tenure at Eisai, Dr. Swanson delivered a highly innovative Phase 2 dose finding study that established proof of concept for lecanemab in treating early Alzheimer’s disease. Based on those Phase 2 results, he led regulatory submission activities that resulted in the accelerated approval of LEQEMBI™ in January 2023. \n\n“I am excited for this great opportunity to lead such a talented and passionate Prothena team where we put patients and their families at the center of everything we do,” said Dr. Swanson. “I am very much looking forward to joining the executive leadership team, working even more closely with the board and Gene, as we continue to advance our potential best-in-class portfolio addressing neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases.” \n\nPrior to his time at Eisai, Dr. Swanson was Senior Scientist and US Head of Neurochemistry, Target Discovery and Assessment at Lundbeck, Inc, where he led several discovery programs, and a laboratory devoted to discovery and preclinical research in psychiatric disease. \n\nDr. Swanson received his Ph.D. from the Medical University of South Carolina in Physiology and Neuroscience, and his B.S. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Zoology with neurobiology emphasis. \n\n**About Prothena**\n\nProthena Corporation plc is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company with expertise in protein dysregulation and a pipeline of investigational therapeutics with the potential to change the course of devastating neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases.
