When was its IPO?  ](#boostAcc1)\n\nAgilysys traces its roots to two companies formed in the mid-20th Century: Standard Radio, formed in 1932, and Pioneer, founded in 1946. These two companies merged as an Ohio corporation in 1963 to create Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., with its principal office in Cleveland. The company conducted an initial public offering in 1971 and commenced trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PIOS. While originally focused on electronic components distribution, the Company embarked on a major strategic transformation in 2003.\n\nIn September, shareholders approved the renaming of Pioneer-Standard Electronics to Agilysys, Inc., which today trades under the ticker symbol AGYS. Agilysys divested its lower-margin distribution businesses, paid off all debt, returned significant capital to shareholders and invested in faster-growing software and service markets. Several years and nearly a dozen strategic acquisitions later, Agilysys emerged as a leading provider of innovative IT solutions to corporate and public-sector customers, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality.\n\nIn August 2011, Agilysys divested its Technology Solutions Group and sharpened its focus on the two remaining businesses.\n\nIn July 2013, Agilysys divested its Retail Solutions Group and further sharpened its focus on the remaining hospitality-focused business.\n\nToday, Agilysys is a leading technology company that provides innovative point-of-sale, property management, inventory and procurement, workforce management, analytics, document management and mobile and wireless solutions and services to the hospitality industry. The company's solutions and services allow property managers to better connect, interact and transact with their customers by streamlining operations, improving efficiency, increasing guest recruitment and wallet share, and enhancing the guest experience.\n\nAgilysys serves four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare. Agilysys operates throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA.\n\n[ Where is Agilysys headquartered?  ](#boostAcc2)\n\nPrincipal Executive Offices:\n\nAgilysys, Inc. 3655 Brookside Parkway, Suite 300 Alpharetta, GA 30022\n\n[ Where are Agilysys common shares traded, and what is the ticker symbol?  ](#boostAcc3)\n\nAgilysys common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol AGYS.\n\n[ What is the fiscal year for Agilysys?  ](#boostAcc4)\n\nAgilysys' fiscal year runs from April 1 through March 31\n\n[ How can I obtain an investor information packet or ask IR questions?  ](#boostAcc5)\n\nAn Agilysys investor packet includes the most current annual report, 10-K, 10-Q, most recent quarterly financial releases, and most current proxy information.

Business.\nOverview\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 45 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise\nsolutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and\nhealthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement,\npayments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class\ncustomer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty,\ndrive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-\nPacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 3655 Brookside Parkway, Suite 300, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30022.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2024\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\nHistory and Significant Events\nOrganized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic\ncomponents and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial\nElectronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring\nbusinesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we\nchanged our name to Agilysys, Inc.\nIn fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology\nsolutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.\nIn fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to\nshareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis,\nInc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the\nhospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of\napplications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust\nsolutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations.\nIn fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth\nopportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating\ncorporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining\noperating units.\nIn fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital\nGroup, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth\nopportunities in the hospitality market.\nIn fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.\nWe converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022.\nToday, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest and staff experiences and allow our\ncustomers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs\nand increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy,\nintegrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective\nmanagement, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.\n4\nOur strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and\nmaintenance agreements, and professional services.\nProducts, Support and Professional Services\nWe are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software\nsolutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; subscription and maintenance; and professional services.\nAreas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core\nsolutions.\nWe present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories:\n• Products\n• Subscription and maintenance\n• Professional services\nTotal revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nProducts $ 49,083 $ 43,638 $ 35,956\nSubscription and maintenance 138,069 118,285 98,958\nProfessional services 50,312 36,142 27,722\nTotal $ 237,464 $ 198,065 $ 162,636\nProducts: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems.\nSoftware sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’\nability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by\nthe ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third\nparty solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as\nstaff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven\nby new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases.\nSubscription and Maintenance: Software subscription and maintenance services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue\nand typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and\npromoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to\nreinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to\noptimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.\nProfessional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions\ninto both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and\nfast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive\nexperience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve\nmaximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.\nOur portfolio of hospitality software solutions:\nThe hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the\nindustry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To\nresolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be\nfocused on delivering integrated “ecosystem cloud” solutions for Hospitality & Leisure, Food & Beverage and Inventory &\nProcurement functions through the Agilysys Hospitality Experience Cloud.\nThe Company delivers modular and integrated software solutions and expertise to businesses seeking to maximize Return on\nExperience (ROE) through hospitality encounters that are both personal and profitable.

Our products have been enabling\nmission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the\nhospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency,\nenhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for\nour customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following\nhospitality verticals: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare.\nWe operate across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA.\n12\nWe estimate our total addressable market to be approximately $5 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the\nopportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it remains in the billions of dollars while our business represents\nonly a fraction of that size. We believe we are well positioned to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the\nindustry.\nCustomers\nOur customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or\ndepartments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of\ncustomer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly\nfragmented.\nHuman Capital\nAs of March 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,900 employees, with approximately 70%, 26%, 2%, and 1% of our employees\nlocated in India, North America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good\nand a critical factor in our success.\nOur senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. Agilysys’ key human capital\nmanagement objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on our strategy. Accordingly, we seek employees who share\na passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality in accordance with our mission statement:\nhelping our customers improve employee and guest experiences, with dedication to past, present and future customer investments in\nour products and services.\nWe believe that our culture is essential to maintaining high quality services and solutions. Our culture impacts the quality of the\nemployees we hire, the way we develop and maintain solutions, and the way we communicate and interact with our customers and\neach other. Our culture is the cornerstone representing our values, our behaviors, our way of working and how we approach our\nbusiness. To reinforce our culture, we operate according to the Agilysys Code of Business Conduct, available on our website\nhttp://www.agilysys.com, which mandates full compliance with applicable laws and regulations and helps to preserve the integrity of\nour Company.\nWe believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their\ngrowth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout\nour industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success. For example,\nwe recently launched an employee stock purchase plan to allow employees to share in the success of the company.\nOur employee town halls, conducted several times annually, play a vital role in fostering transparency, engagement, alignment, and a\nsense of community. These town halls provide a platform to recognize and celebrate employee achievements, milestones, and\ncontributions, and provide an opportunity for employees to ask questions of leadership.\nAs recognition for our commitment to our employees, we were awarded a LinkedIn Top Company 2024 Award for midsize\nemployers.\nWe are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We\nmake all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to\nreligion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy,\nmedical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent\ncontractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected,\nregardless of individual differences. We believe that each of our employees' individual character, virtues, and individual experiences\nwill leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers.\nSeasonality\nOccasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large\ncustomer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.\nIntellectual Property\n13\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license\nagreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical\nmeasures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business.\nWe do not believe that our business is dependent on any single item of intellectual property, or that any single item of intellectual\nproperty is material to the operation of our business. However, since we consider trademarks to be a valuable asset of our business, we\nhave an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names,\ntaglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine registration to be appropriate and cost effective.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated,\ncircumvented, or challenged. See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the section titled “Risk Factors — We may not be able\nto enforce or protect our intellectual property rights” for a description of the risks related to our intellectual property.\nCompetition\nOur solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with\ncustomers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service.\nWe compete with other full-service providers who sell and deliver bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of software, hardware,\nsubscription, maintenance, and professional services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle\nCorp., Shiji, Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies who provide either POS or PMS\nsolutions like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such\ncompliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.\nFor information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report.\nAccess to Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports\nare available free of charge through our corporate website, http://www.agilysys.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such\nmaterial is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies are also available\nwithout charge by a written request to Agilysys, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 3655 Brookside Parkway, Suite 300, Alpharetta,\nGeorgia 30022 or by requesting copies through our website, under “Investor Relations.” The information posted on our website is not\nincorporated into this Annual Report. Reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file\nelectronically, are maintained on the SEC website, http://www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMarkets, Competition, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and global conditions.\nBecause we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including\nin areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts, natural disasters, or disease\noutbreaks may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or\nthe curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology\nbudgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause\ncustomers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services.\nOur business is negatively impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in\nenergy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in\nair travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. Our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could\nbe materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities due to a pandemic or other wide-ranging\nand sustained events.\n14\nSimilarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which\nmay adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new solutions, product upgrades and services that achieve market\nacceptance.\nOur business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order\nto remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the\ninvestment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are\notherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new\nproducts or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at\nall, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and\nresources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n• Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n• Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers;\nand\n• Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware\nproducts, such as mobile devices.\nOur product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of\ntime, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related\nproduct opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully.\nOur product development activities also could be impacted by competition from products with new features or leveraging new\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that render our existing products less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond\neffectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we need new technologies or if we are not able to develop new\nproducts or product upgrades acceptable to customers to remain competitive, the development, acquisition, and implementation of\nthose new products, product upgrades or technologies may require us to make significant capital investments.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not\ntechnologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price\nreductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nSeveral companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes\nit likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our\ncompetitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems\nintegration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete\neffectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to\nreduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or\nservices, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price\nmodifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to\ncontend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could\nadversely affect our revenues and liquidity.\nOur future success depends on our ability to execute on strategic initiatives, to properly manage investments in our business, and\nto enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.\nOur long-term strategy is focused on continually investing in and growing our business and operations, both organically and through\nacquisitions.\nInvestments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, research and development, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion,\nand talent are critical components for realizing our strategy. In particular, we believe we must continue to dedicate a significant\n15\namount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and\ndevelopment may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate.\nSuch investments present challenges and risks and may not be successful financially or otherwise, especially in new areas in which we\nhave little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our short-term profitability. To succeed in such efforts, we\nmust be able to properly deploy financial and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, balance the extent and timing of\ninvestments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas and the servicing of our existing\ncustomers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with the new solutions, in which we have\ninvested.\nOur success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure,\nsystems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new\nimplementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems\nduring or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and\ninfrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on certain suppliers makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs.\nWe do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services\nneeds from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner\nprograms, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it\nmay have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel due to rising labor costs or other reasons, our ability to operate and grow our\nbusiness may be impaired and our financial performance may suffer.\nWe depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we\nmust retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, particularly in growth areas we have identified. Employee\nretention is an industry challenge especially given the competitive labor market for software developers. As we grow, we must also\nenhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in\nthe geographies in which we operate and may be limited in the software development disciplines we seek to expand. We may be at a\ndisadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in\ntrending market sectors. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed, our ability to\noperate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with\nrevenue growth, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur international operations have many associated risks.\nWe continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention\nand financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance\nthat we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and\nchallenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial\ncondition.\nWe have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Dubai, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and\nIndia. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support\nchannels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and\ndifficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws, rules and regulations; producing localized versions of our\nproducts; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs,\nenforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for\nintellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; foreign currency\nfluctuations; inflation and any regulatory actions to counter inflation; and political and economic instability abroad.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.\n16\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research\nand development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our\nadministrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is\nconcentrated in our India research and development center. While we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, a\nnatural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location\nthat prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers.\nRegulatory Matters, Information Security, Data Privacy, and Product Stability\nOur products and services may not function properly if we experience significant coding or configuration errors.\nDespite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our on-premise and cloud-based solutions\nsometimes contain coding or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative\nconsequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released on-premise or cloud-based solutions can be time consuming and\ncostly. Errors in our on-premise and cloud-based solutions could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with\nother software or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages, could create security vulnerabilities in\nour products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services,\nand could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services\nincorporated into our own. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our on-premise or cloud-based\nsolutions or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. Customers rely on our on-premise\nand cloud-based solutions and related services to run their businesses, and errors in our solutions and related services could expose us\nto product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our\nfuture sales.\nImplementation of software solutions often involves a significant commitment of resources, and any failure to deliver as promised\non a significant implementation could adversely affect our business.\nThe implementation of software solutions often involves a significant commitment of resources and is subject to a number of\nsignificant risks over which we may or may not have control. These risks include:\n• the features of the implemented software may not meet the expectations or fit the business model of the customer;\n• our pool of implementation personnel cannot quickly and easily be augmented for complex implementation projects, such\nthat resources issues, if not planned and managed effectively, could lead to costly project delays;\n• customer-specific factors, such as the stability, functionality, interconnection and scalability of the customer’s pre-existing\ninformation technology infrastructure, as well as financial or other circumstances could destabilize, delay or prevent the\ncompletion of the implementation process; and\n• customers and their partners may not fully or timely perform the actions required to be performed by them to ensure\nsuccessful implementation, including measures we recommend to safeguard against technical and business risks.\nAs a result of these and other risks, some of our customers may incur large, unplanned costs in connection with the purchase and\ninstallation of our solutions. Also, implementation projects could take longer than planned or fail. We may not be able to reduce or\neliminate protracted installation or significant additional costs. Significant delays or unsuccessful customer implementation projects\ncould result in cancellation or renegotiation of existing agreements, claims from customers, harm our reputation and negatively impact\nour operating results.\nWe use open-source software in our solutions that may subject our solutions to general release or require us to re-engineer our\nsolutions.\nWe use open-source software in our solutions and may use more open-source software in the future. From time to time, there have\nbeen claims by companies claiming ownership of software that was previously thought to be open-source and that was incorporated by\nother companies into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be\nopen-source software.\nSome open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create\nbased upon the open-source software and that we license these modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-\nsource license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine or, in some cases, link our proprietary\nsoftware solutions with or to open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open-source licenses, be\nrequired to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions or license such proprietary solutions under the terms of a\nparticular open-source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use.\n17\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party\ncommercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition,\nopen-source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open-source cannot be eliminated, and\ncould, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open-source software,\nwe may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to\ndiscontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial\naction that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nWe are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could\nnegatively impact us or our business.\nOur business and operations are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate or in which we\noffer our solutions, including, among other things, with respect to data privacy, artificial intelligence (“AI”), information security,\ntrade compliance, tax, and labor matters.\nIn addition, as we are increasingly building and licensing from third party providers new and evolving technologies, such as AI,\nmachine learning, analytics, and biometrics, as part of our offerings, our business and operations may become subject to additional\ncomplex and evolving regulatory requirements pertaining to the sale or use of these technologies. The evolving regulatory\nenvironment surrounding these new technologies may also increase our research and development costs, compliance costs, and\nconfidentiality and security risks, and result in inconsistencies in evolving legal frameworks across jurisdictions. The sale of these\ntechnologies, or their use by us or by our customers or partners, may also subject us to additional risks, including reputational harm,\ncompetitive harm or legal liabilities, due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social\nor discriminatory contexts. Third-parties may criticize us or seek to hold us responsible not only for our own activities in this regard\nbut also for the activities of our customers or partners.\nWe anticipate that we will become subject to an increasing amount of regulation and disclosure requirements related to environmental,\nsocial and governance (“ESG”) matters. In addition, stakeholders, including investors, customers, suppliers and employees, may\npressure us to make commitments on these matters that may be difficult to manage or achieve. If we fail to make or meet such\ncommitments, we may be subject to criticism, reputational harm or legal liability.\nThe application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with applicable\nregulatory requirements may be onerous, time-consuming, and expensive, especially where these requirements are inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction or where the jurisdictional reach of certain requirements is not clearly defined or seeks to reach across\nnational borders. Regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may make it difficult or impossible to do business in or comply with the\nrules of another jurisdiction.\nWhile we endeavor to implement policies, procedures, and systems designed to achieve compliance with these regulatory\nrequirements, we cannot assure you that these policies, procedures, or systems will be adequate or that we or our personnel will not\nviolate these policies and procedures or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations may harm our\nreputation and deter government agencies and other existing or potential customers or partners from purchasing our solutions.\nFurthermore, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our\nofficers, or our employees, restrictions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nCyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to collect, process,\ntransmit, and store electronic information on behalf of our customers. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for\na variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, procurement, invoicing, and email communications. These systems are\nsusceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, hacking, terrorist attacks, and similar events.\nWe have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data\nagainst cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon\nwhom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported\nactors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in\nour systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in\nthe design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems,\nand those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses,\n18\ncredential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized\naccess to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.\nIn addition, threat actors are also increasingly using tools and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove\nforensic evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover from cyberattacks in\na timely or effective manner. As AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cyberattacks created through AI.\nThese attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat\nactor or create more effective phishing emails. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business\npartners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance\nor other system disruptions.\nThe number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including\nsophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks,\nanticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain\nundetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained\ntherein, our customers and ultimately, our business.\nFor example, we use Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer application to enable file transfers with some of our customers. On May\n31, 2023, Progress Software disclosed that it had identified a previously unknown vulnerability in its MOVEit Transfer application.\nWe immediately followed the recommendations from Progress Software to address the vulnerabilities in the MOVEit Transfer\napplication. However, we identified unauthorized file downloads from our MOVEit Transfer application impacting about 130\ncustomers who used our InfoGenesis POS, Eatec and Agilysys Analyze products. All impacted customers were notified in June 2023,\nand the incident has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nCyberattacks on our systems and “supply-chain” attacks on systems of third parties upon whom we rely, and any related operational\ndisruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data),\ncould create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current\nor potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, reputation, and results of operations.\nPrivacy, information security, and data protection laws, rules, and regulations could affect or limit how we collect and use\npersonal information, increase our costs, and adversely affect our business opportunities. A failure to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as\ntheir and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable\ninformation is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security\nsuch as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what\nconstitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by\njurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their\napplicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to\ncomply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or\npotential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions,\ncomplaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.\nIn addition, many U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the SEC, require companies to provide\nnotice of cybersecurity incidents involving certain types of personal data or unauthorized access to, or interference with, our\ninformation systems to the public, certain individuals, the media, government authorities, or other third parties. Certain of these laws\nand regulations include notice or disclosure obligations contingent upon the result of complex analyses, including in some cases a\ndetermination of materiality. The nature of cybersecurity incidents can make it difficult to quickly and comprehensively assess an\nincident's overall impact to our business, and we may make errors in our assessments. If we are unable to appropriately assess\na cybersecurity incident in the context of required analyses then we could face compliance issues under these laws and regulations,\nand we could be subject to lawsuits, regulatory fines or investigations, or other liabilities, any or all of which could adversely affect\nour business and operating results. Furthermore, cybersecurity incidents experienced by us, or by our customers or vendors, that lead\nto public disclosures may also lead to widespread negative publicity and increased government or regulatory scrutiny. Any security\ncompromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation; erode customer confidence in our security\nmeasures; negatively affect our ability to attract new customers; or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or investigations,\nor other liability, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Even the perception of inadequate\nsecurity may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers.\n19\nAdditionally, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to investigate and address any actual or\nsuspected cybersecurity incident or to prevent further or additional incidents. To maintain business relationships, we may find it\nnecessary or desirable to incur costs to provide remediation and incentives to customers or other business partners following an actual\nor suspected security incident. We also cannot be sure that our existing cybersecurity insurance will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms, in sufficient amounts to cover any claims we submit, or at all. Further, we cannot be sure that insurers will not deny\ncoverage as to any claim, and some security incidents may be outside the scope of our coverage, including in instances where they are\nconsidered force majeure events. Security incidents may result in increased costs for cybersecurity insurance. One or more large,\nsuccessful claims against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, or changes in our insurance policies, including premium\nincreases or large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software solutions may result in reduced sales or liabilities.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures, and use information technology systems, to help ensure the proper handling of our\ncustomers and their customers data from both a data privacy and an information security perspective. We also evaluate the information\nsecurity of potential partners and vendors as part of our selection process and attempt to negotiate adequate protections from such third\nparties when we enter into contracts with them. Our customer contracts also obligate our customers to undertake steps necessary for\nsatisfying individual rights under laws and regulations. While these policies, procedures, systems, contractual provisions, and\nmeasures are designed to mitigate the risks associated with handling or processing personal data, including categories of personal data\nwhich may be classed as sensitive data, they cannot always safeguard against all risks, nor can we control the actions of third parties,\nincluding vendors, customers and partners. In addition, it may be possible for customer and guest data to be compromised from\ncustomers’ information technology systems if our customer does not maintain appropriate data privacy and information security\nprocedures.\nThe improper handling of personal data including sensitive data, or even the perception of such mishandling (whether or not valid), or\nother security lapses or breaches affecting us, our partners, our customers, or our products or services, could reduce demand for our\nproducts or services or otherwise expose us to financial or reputational harm or legal liability.\nFor certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create\nsignificant risk exposure for us.\nWe maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other\ncloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these\nproviders with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If\nthese third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other\ndifficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs,\npotential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate\nthese services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it\ncould result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially\nadversely impact our business.\nWe also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our\ncompetitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be\nsmaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in\nan effort to benefit our margins.\nIf any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any\nother disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a\ncompetitor, macroeconomic issues, or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to\ninternally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce\nour service levels, any of which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we\nstrive to establish contractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be\nsuccessful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling\nor unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the\nevent our relationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\n20\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to\nprotect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary\ntechnology.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual\nproperty or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by\nother parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase\nand overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the\nattention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the\nconduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we\nreceive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe\npatents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on\nelectronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although judgement was entered for us and against\nAmeranth on all claims in that suit in 2022, the litigation resulted in substantial expenses, even though it did not have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal\nliability.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high\nquality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be\ndamaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions,\nbreaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions\nor breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses.\nIn addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include\nprovisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately\nprotect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for\nerrors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be\navailable on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not\ndisclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available\ninsurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.\nRisks Relating to the Industries We Serve\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of\nthat industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality\nindustry, such as those resulting from the impacts of pandemics, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit\nthe industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products.\nConsolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other\ncompanies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry.\nAlthough recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance\nthat future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a\ncompany that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services\nfrom us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n21\nInsolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our\ncustomers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property.\nCustomers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements\nwith us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and\nliquidity could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nOur stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low close of $63.77 to a high close of\n$91.40. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this\nsection, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n• uncertainties in the global economy;\n• economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;\n• our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of\nsecurities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial\nrelationships or capital commitments;\n• our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n• any major change in our board or management; and\n• general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations\nand acts of war or terrorism.\nAdditionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the\nvolatility of our common share price over time.\nIf we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.\nAs part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek\nacquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such\nacquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen\ndifficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired\nbusinesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.\nOur financial results may be significantly impacted by changes in our tax position.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be impacted by\nchanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets\n(including our net operating loss carryforwards), changes in unrecognized tax benefits, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nAny of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, including the United States, may from time to time review the pricing arrangements between us and our foreign\nsubsidiaries or among our foreign subsidiaries. An adverse determination by one or more tax authorities in this regard may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets which can provide us with significant future cash tax savings if we are able to use them,\nincluding significant net operating losses. However, the extent to which we will be able to use these net operating losses may be\nimpacted, restricted, or eliminated by a number of factors, including changes in tax rates, laws or regulations, and whether we generate\nsufficient future taxable income. To the extent that we are unable to utilize our net operating losses or other losses, our results of\noperations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. When we cease to have net operating losses\navailable to us in a particular tax jurisdiction, either through their expiration, disallowance, or utilization, our cash tax liability will\nincrease in that jurisdiction.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could negatively impact our financial results.\n22\nWe earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets, and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the\nBritish pound sterling, euro, Indian rupee, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar, and Canadian dollar, among others. Because our\nconsolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of entities\nusing non-U.S. dollar functional currencies into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each\nreporting period, meaning that we are exposed to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, the revaluation and\nsettlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar impact our net income with\nassociated gains or losses recorded within other income (expense), net.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in jurisdictions where we have not collected and remitted such taxes\nfrom our customers. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event actual results differ, we may need\nto make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $32.8 million of goodwill and $17.0 million of intangible assets, net, on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more\nfrequently if an event or events indicate the potential for impairment. We assess as needed whether there have been impairments in our\nother intangible assets. We make assumptions and estimates in our assessments that can be complex and subjective. In our\nassumptions and estimates we consider whether negative factors exist such as deteriorating economic conditions, disruptions to our\nbusiness, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, intensified competition, market capitalization declines, or significant\nchanges in use of the intangible assets. To the extent that such factors or other negative factors emerge, we may record non-cash\nimpairment charges in the future that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.\nWhile we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront\ncredit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess\nof federally insured amounts, if any.\nOther Risk Factors\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents and Delaware Law could make an acquisition of the company more difficult\nand may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our\nstockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), contain provisions that could\nmake it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions\ninclude:\n• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n• the ability of our board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors;\n• the ability of our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without\nstockholder approval and with such designations, powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or\nrestrictions as our board of directors may deem appropriate;\n• prohibition on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n• the required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock\nentitled to vote in the election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws, though our bylaws can also be amended by vote of our board of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,\nfor a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.”\nBecause our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn\naffect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a\nprice in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or\nmanagement of the company may be unsuccessful.\n23\nAccounting principle updates could have a negative impact on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our\napplication of new accounting principles can have a significant impact on our operating results including previously reported results\nsubject to any retroactive treatment. In addition, new accounting principles may require significant changes to certain aspects of our\nbusiness including how we operate and contract with our customers and suppliers. In order to manage such changes, we may incur\nsignificant costs to implement and maintain potentially extensive updates to our accounting systems and internal control over financial\nreporting that could negatively impact our financial condition and the results of our operations. Furthermore, difficulties or delays in\napplying new accounting principles could result in a failure to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to prevent or detect fraud or internal control\ndeficiencies including material weaknesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe design and operate our internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance about the reliability of financial\nreporting including the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent\nlimitations, our system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement. Accordingly,\nalthough the Company’s management has concluded that our internal controls are effective as of March 31, 2024, we cannot provide\nabsolute assurance that the objectives of our controls system are met. No evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\nassurance that control matters and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably\nforeseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security\ntools and third-party managed security services that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified\nvulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring and\ndetection tools. We also evaluate the information security of potential partners and vendors as part of our selection process and\nattempt to negotiate adequate protections from such third parties when we enter into contracts with them. Although our security\nprogram is designed to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third party risks,, we rely on our partners and vendors to\nimplement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be\nsuccessful.\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities.\nWe use a widely-adopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop\nrelated security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage\ntabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, and third-party red team exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our\ninformation security program and improve our security measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct annual\nSecurity and Organizational Controls 2 (SOC 2) examination of the security controls for systems storing customer data. The external\nauditor also conducts an annual payment card industry (PCI) data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment\ninformation, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems.\nOur systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well\nas loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our customers) and other data, confidential\ninformation or intellectual property, and we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain data. However, to date no\ncybersecurity incidents have had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and we are not\npresently aware of any cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us. Any significant disruption to our service\nor access to our systems could result in a loss of customer data and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a\npenetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to\nbusiness, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. See \"Risk Factors — Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our\nreputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.”\nThe Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads the global information security organization responsible for\noverseeing our information security program. Our CISO has over 25 years of industry experience, including serving in similar roles\n24\nleading and overseeing cybersecurity programs at other public companies, and is a Certified Information Security Professional and\nInformation Systems Security Architecture Professional. Team members who support our information security program have relevant\neducational and industry experience, including holding similar positions at large technology companies. Given the nature of our\nbusiness, management is highly focused on identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, and our CISO and information security\nteams provide regular reports to senior management and other relevant teams on various cybersecurity threats, assessments and\nfindings.\nThe Board has primary responsibility for oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee is also responsible for\nreviewing the Company’s information and cybersecurity risks and the steps that management has taken to protect against threats to the\nCompany’s information systems and security, including results of periodic security assessments performed in conjunction with\nongoing monitoring. The Audit Committee has formed a Cybersecurity Risk Subcommittee consisting of two independent directors to\nassist the Audit Committee in its oversight of cybersecurity risks. By its charter, all members of the Cybersecurity Risk Subcommittee\nmust have a background or experience in information technology or cybersecurity and an understanding of cyber threats, risk\nmitigation and policy.\nThe results of our SOC2 and PCI assessments are reported to the Cybersecurity Risk Subcommittee. Both the Subcommittee and the\nBoard receive regular reports from our CISO on various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas\nof emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance. The Board also oversees our annual enterprise risk\nassessment, where we assess key risks within the company, including security and technology risks and cybersecurity threats.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 22,000 square feet of office space. In\naddition, we lease approximately 36,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 8,000 square feet of office space in\nBellevue, Washington, 5,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in\nRoswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 182,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India, 7,000 square feet in\nToronto, Canada, and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal\noptions for periods of up to 10 years. We believe our office space facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and do not\nanticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging\nthat certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g.,\nrestaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. On May 11, 2022, final\njudgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit. In March 2024, we settled all remaining issues with\nAmeranth, although the case remains open pending court approval of the settlement agreement.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n25\nItem 4A.

[Reserved]\n28\nItem 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the\ngeneral financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including:\n— what factors affect our business;\n— what our earnings and costs were;\n— why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;\n— where the earnings came from;\n— how our financial condition was affected; and\n— where the cash will come from to fund future operations.\nThe MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nInformation provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about\ninvesting in Agilysys.\nOverview\nRecent Developments\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, influenced by a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, political unrest, armed conflicts, labor shortages and natural disasters. We believe such conditions are\nimpacting customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins\nparticularly in areas outside of the United States.\nOur Business\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 45 years, delivering innovative state-of-the-art cloud-native SaaS and\non-premise guest-centric technology solutions.

Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future\nperiods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. As of March 31, 2024, we had $78.5 million of federal net\noperating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to 2039, and $42.5 million of federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $111.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that\nexpire, if unused, in fiscal years 2025 through 2043. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient\n33\nevidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances.

Professional services gross profit increased $1.1 million and gross profit margin decreased from 25.3% to 22.6% reflecting\nlower utilization rates due to higher non-billable hours on new, more complex solution implementations over the comparable annual\nperiods.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and other charges, increased $14.5 million, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2023\ncompared with fiscal 2022.

Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.4 million or 20.0% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022\ndue to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives.\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles increased $0.1 million or\n5.4% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the addition of certain intangible assets that began amortizing in January 2022\nsubsequent to the acquisition of ResortSuite Inc. (ResortSuite) as described in Note 15, Business Combination, to our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOther charges, net. Other charges, net decreased $1.1 million due to a significant reduction in non-recurring charges including\nResortSuite acquisition costs during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nLegal settlements. Legal settlements decreased $0.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to a decrease in\nsettlements of employment and other business-related matters.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nYear ended March 31, Favorable (unfavorable)\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income $ 2,192 $ 59 $ 2,133 nm\nInterest (expense) — (12) 12 nm\nOther income (expense), net 697 145 552 nm\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 2,889 $ 192 $ 2,697 nm\nnm – not meaningful\nInterest income.

Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of\ntax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in\nunrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the next 12 months.\n36\nBecause of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company's deferred\ntax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during\nthe future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. As of March 31, 2023, we had $132.0 million of\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to 2039, and $43.8 million of federal net operating\nloss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $133.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that\nexpire, if unused, in fiscal years 2024 through 2042. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient\nevidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we\nbelieve it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant\nportion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of\ncertain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our\ncontractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases, to\nour Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAt March 31, 2024, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 95% were held in the United States, were deposited in bank\naccounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of\nacquisition of three months or less and money market funds. Certain bank account balances may exceed federally insured limits. We\ndetermine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that\nuse quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We\nbelieve credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents.\nWe believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $144.9 million as of March 31, 2024, and access to capital\nmarkets will provide adequate funds to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, as well as our long-term\nliquidity requirements.\nCash Flow\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 48,186 $ 34,463 $ 28,475\nInvesting activities (7,602) (6,870) (25,679)\nFinancing activities (8,558) (11,094) (4,901)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 23 (628) (104)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash $ 32,049 $ 15,871 $ (2,209)\nCash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $48.2 million in fiscal 2024. The\nprovision of cash was due primarily to our net income of $86.2 million adjusted for $48.1 million in non-cash expense including\ndepreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, gains on asset disposals and an increase of $10.1 million\nfrom the changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $34.5 million in fiscal 2023. The provision of cash was due primarily to our net\nincome of $14.6 million adjusted for $16.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based\ncompensation and an increase of $3.5 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $28.5 million in fiscal 2022.

We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life\ninsurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in\nthese corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance\nsheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining\npolicies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated\nbeneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets at the balance sheet date.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect\non our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,\nor capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nsignificant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments,\nintangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies\ndiscussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because\ntheir application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on\nestimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in\nthe following paragraphs.\nFor all these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely\nrequire adjustment.\nRevenue recognition. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The\nmajority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms\nand conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different\n38\ngoods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each\nindividual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and\nservices that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the\ncontract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange\nfor transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or\nrefund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or\nrefund.\nTypically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide\nsignificant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The\nsoftware is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical\nsupport. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software\nrevenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified\nby the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon\nreceipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of\nsale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from\nthe software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the\nsoftware, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance\nobligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the\ncontract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and\nrenewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nWe derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for\nour proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes\nthe same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the\ncontract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of\npayment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, implementation, installation, integration and training and are\ngenerally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the\nservices are being performed. Certain professional development services are recognized upon delivery of the developed solutions to\nthe customer. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability\nto access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in\nthe contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\nWe use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies.\n39\nShare-based compensation. We have an equity incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock\noptions, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant\nto awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares.\nWe record compensation expense related to stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares, and employee stock purchase plan shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the\nfair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and restricted stock unit grants subject only to a service\ncondition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and stock-settled appreciation right\ngrants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing\nmodel with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate,\nexpected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method.\nFor employee stock purchase plan grants, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing\nmodel with inputs including the closing market price at grant date and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected term,\nand expected volatility of our common shares over the offering period based on historical volatility. For restricted share, restricted\nstock unit and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing\nmodel that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold,\nperformance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on\nhistorical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and\nsuboptimal exercise factor. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used\nto value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation, to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional information about accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services\ninternationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises\nfrom exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue from international operations was 6%, 7% and 7%,\nrespectively, of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of\noperations for the 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue,\nexpenses, operating profit and net income.\n40\nItem 8.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of March 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024, and our report dated\nMay 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 21, 2024\n43\nAGILYSYS, INC.

Nature of Operations\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 45 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise\nsolutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and\nhealthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement,\npayments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world-class\ncustomer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty,\ndrive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-\nPacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within the fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2024\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments\nin affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been\neliminated.\nUse of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported\nperiods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents. 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 95% were held in the United States, were deposited in\nbank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments. Certain bank account balances may exceed federally insured limits. We\nconsider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on\ndemand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the same or following business day after instruction to\nredeem. Cash equivalent investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit,\ncommercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Commercial paper cash equivalents totaled $10.0 million\nand $5.0 million as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using\nsignificant other observable inputs (level 2) based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates.\nAllowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the\ninability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical\nexperience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we\nperform periodic credit evaluations of our customers.\nCustomer credit allowance. We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount\nof customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In certain\ncases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we\ninvoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested\nby the customer within the terms of our contract.\nInventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of\nrelated reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure\nappropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual\nprovisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change\nand/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations\n49\nmay be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of\nhistorical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”)\nassets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-\ncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent\nour obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease\npayments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing\nsince our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease\neconomic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives\nreceived or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income\non a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have\nleases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index\nor rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have\na term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material\nimpact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party\ntransactions associated with our lease agreements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net\nassets of acquired companies. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill was $32.8 million and $32.6 million,\nrespectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist,\nbased on our one reporting unit. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based\non its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. The Company is also required to\ncompare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events\nand circumstances require an interim assessment. The Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite-\nlived assets has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAcquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include identifiable customer relationships, non-competition agreements,\ndeveloped technology, and trade names. We amortize the cost of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful\nlives, which are periods of 15 years or less, primarily on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the\nassets are utilized. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are determined\nprimarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows attributable to these assets to present value using\nestimates and assumptions determined by management.\nLong-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor\nreplacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of,\nthe cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under\nfinance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.\nThe estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years;\nfurniture – 7 to 10 years; equipment – 3 to 10 years; software – 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the\neconomic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts\ncapitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s\ncompletion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying\namounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future\nundiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in\nNote 4, Property and Equipment, Net.\nForeign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting\npurposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the\nperiod-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The\ncumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within shareholders’ equity in\n50\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an\noperation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains\nand losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results.\nRevenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating\nsystems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. For the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue from\ninternational operations was 6%, 7% and 7%, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented.\nOur customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts\nare governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any\nindividual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services,\nthe associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract\nare defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be\ntransferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction\nprice is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or\nservices to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain\nthe contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund.\nTypically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide\nsignificant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The\nsoftware is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical\nsupport. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software\nrevenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified\nby the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon\nreceipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of\nsale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from\nthe software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the\nsoftware, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance\nobligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the\ncontract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and\nrenewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nWe derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for\nour proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes\nthe same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the\ncontract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of\npayment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, implementation, installation, integration and training and are\ngenerally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the\nservices are being performed. Certain professional development services are recognized upon delivery of the developed solutions to\nthe customer. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability\nto access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in\nthe contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\n51\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\nWe use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies.\nComprehensive income. Comprehensive income is the total of net income, as currently reported under GAAP, plus other\ncomprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that\nare not required to be recorded in determining net income, but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive income.\nFair value measurements. We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial\nassets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event\noccurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques.\nInvestments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some\nare endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we\nmust maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated\nbeneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which\napproximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender\nvalue of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed\nto those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current\nliabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10,\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We\nrecognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in\nthe periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that\nsome portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is\nmade on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical\ntaxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the\nimplementation of tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax\npositions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is\nrecognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable\nunder relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9,\nIncome Taxes.\nAdvertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense\nwas $6.7 million, $4.8 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”) to update income tax disclosure requirements\nprimarily by requiring specific categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes\n52\npaid by jurisdiction. The amendments in the ASU also remove disclosures related to certain unrecognized tax benefits and deferred\ntaxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, or our fiscal 2026. The amendments may be\napplied prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on\nour consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) to expand reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis,\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), a description of\nother segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when\ndeciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 applies to entities with a single reportable segment. Annual disclosures are required\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, or our fiscal 2025. Interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, or our fiscal 2026. Retrospective application is required for all prior periods presented with early\nadoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nFor in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating\nsystems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $49.1\nmillion, $43.6 million, and $36.0 million during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. Subscription, maintenance, and substantially all\nprofessional services revenue recognized over time totaled $188.4 million, $154.4 million, and $126.7 million during fiscal 2024,\n2023, and 2022.\nContract Balances\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is\nconditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to\nproducts and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We\nreceive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to\nconsideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally\ndue from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract.\nRevenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $50.9 million and $45.3 million\nduring fiscal 2024 and 2023. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $2.2\nmillion and $1.7 million, respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional.\nOur arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2024 are\nexpected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract\nSales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a\ncontract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred\nwhen the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an\nagreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally\nbased on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses\nare immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one\nyear or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected.\nWe had $4.8 million and $3.9 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These balances\nare included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we expensed $3.9 million\nand $3.6 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $1.6 million and $1.3\n53\nmillion, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred.\n4.

The InfoGenesis indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding\nthe carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n6. Leases\nThe majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of\noffice equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases.\nWe do not have any related party leases. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We\ndo not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of\nthe lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe subleased one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that expired during fiscal year 2024.\nThe components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as\nfollows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nOperating leases expense $ 5,842 $ 5,301\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of ROU assets 2 3\nInterest on lease liabilities — 1\nTotal finance lease expense 2 4\nVariable lease costs 470 700\nShort term lease expense 258 300\nSublease income (654) (789)\nTotal lease expense $ 5,918 $ 5,516\nOther information related to leases for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\nSupplemental cash flow information 2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n(in thousands):\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,197 $ 5,862\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 5 6\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 2 4\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands):\nOperating leases $ 9,832 $ 8,292\nWeighted average remaining lease terms\nOperating leases 6.69 7.59\nFinance leases — 0.58\nWeighted average discount rates\nOperating leases 7.05% 6.44%\nFinance leases — 4.50%\n55\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-\ncancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nMarch 31, 2024:\n(In thousands) Operating leases\nFiscal year ending March 31,\n2025 $ 4,474\n2026 5,163\n2027 4,774\n2028 4,538\n2029 3,797\nThereafter 7,349\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 30,095\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease\nliabilities (6,203)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 23,892\n7.

The fiscal 2024 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the release of the valuation allowances.\nThe fiscal 2023 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense and minimal expense from the U.S. The fiscal 2023 tax\nprovision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets; offset by current year expense in foreign\njurisdictions.\n57\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued liabilities $ 10,135 $ 8,748\nAllowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 154 132\nFederal losses and credit carryforwards 28,588 36,912\nForeign losses and credit carryforwards 3,324 3,555\nState losses and credit carryforwards 7,248 10,080\nDeferred revenue 270 291\nCapitalized research expenses 22,280 11,399\nProperty and equipment and software amortization - 325\nOperating lease liabilities 5,715 4,171\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (694) (536)\nOther 438 185\n77,458 75,262\nLess: valuation allowance (2,938) (67,928)\nTotal 74,520 7,334\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (4,230) (3,153)\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (3,274) (3,659)\nOther (198) 12\nTotal (7,702) (6,800)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net $ 66,818 $ 534\nAt March 31, 2024, we had $78.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to\n2039, and $42.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Canada,\nSingapore and the U.A.E. subsidiaries have $0.7 million, $0.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million of net operating loss\ncarryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Singapore and the U.A.E. can be carried forward indefinitely. Canada losses\ncan be carried back three years and carried forward 20 years. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”.\nOne of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5\nyears of operations which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50% of regular India\nincome taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the\nbenefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $3.9 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company has paid minimum alternative\ntaxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of $1.8 million as of March 31, 2024.\nAt March 31, 2024 we also had $111.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2043.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances offsetting certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization\nof the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2024, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $2.9 million\nwas comprised of $1.5 million for U.S. state deferred tax assets, and $1.4 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong,\nSingapore, and the U.A.E. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of\ntaxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We consider the scheduled\nreversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected earnings, and tax\nplanning strategies in our assessment of positive and negative evidence supporting the likelihood of deferred tax asset realization. We\nmaintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of\nthe allowances.\nThe undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are\ndistributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed\nearnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $30.1 million and $22.2 million as of March 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we\nwill invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign expansion. The determination\nof the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable.\n58\nUncertain tax positions as of March 31, are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 575 $ 575 $ 575\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (575) — —\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 562 — —\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 562 $ 575 $ 575\nWe recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a\ncomponent of general and administrative expenses. For the year ended March 31, 2024, we reduced accrued interest and penalty by\n$0.6 million. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. As\nof March 31, 2024, no interest or penalties were accrued. As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately $0.6 million of interest and\npenalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate.\nIn the U.S. we file federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although\nwe have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2011\nforward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2019 forward in certain state jurisdictions.\nWe also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years.\nYears beginning after 2017 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities.\n10. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow\neligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100% of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax\ncontributions and 50% of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each\nyear for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $1.9 million, $1.7 million, and\n$1.4 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nWe also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in\naccordance with local statutory requirements and business practices.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nWe maintain certain defined benefit plans covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance with local statutory\nrequirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death,\nincapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment\nwith the Company. The Leave Encashment Plan provides a lump-sum payment to employees when they leave the Company based on\na multiple of their final monthly salary. Both the Gratuity and Leave Encashment Plans are unfunded with obligation amounts\ndetermined by actuarial valuations. These obligation amounts are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Employee benefit\nobligations” within “Other non-current liabilities”. All expenses associated with these plans are recorded in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations within “Operating expenses”.\nEmployer benefit obligations as of and related changes for the years ended March 31 are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nEmployee benefit obligations as of April 1 $ 2,742 $ 2,470 $ 1,728\nEmployee benefits paid (175) (255) (290)\nEmployer expenses 1,748 527 1,032\nEmployee benefit obligations $ 4,315 $ 2,742 $ 2,470\n59\nEndorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance\nAgilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements.\nWe entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified\namount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary.\nOur investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair\nvalue at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash surrender value of $1.0\nmillion for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those\nexecutives' designated beneficiaries of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within \"Other non-current\nliabilities.\"\nChanges in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within\n“Other (expense) income, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and are immaterial.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\n12. Earnings per Share\nThe following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average\nnumber of shares of dilutive potential common shares.\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 86,195 $ 14,582 $ 6,478\nSeries A convertible preferred stock dividends (1,204) (1,836) (1,836)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 84,991 $ 12,746 $ 4,642\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 25,668 24,694 24,357\nDilutive SSARs 929 1,059 1,063\nDilutive RSUs 10 — —\nDilutive unvested restricted shares 234 176 63\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 26,842 25,929 25,483\nIncome per share - basic: $ 3.31 $ 0.52 $ 0.19\nIncome per share - diluted: $ 3.17 $ 0.49 $ 0.18\nAnti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units,\nESPP shares, performance shares, and preferred shares 175 1,741 1,736\nBasic income per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares\noutstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 436,177, 407,324 and 147,973 of\nrestricted shares at March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not\nconsidered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates.\nDiluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled\nappreciation rights (SSARs), unvested restricted shares, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares, and\nperformance shares, that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share\ncannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive.\n60\n13. Share-based Compensation\nWe may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance\nshares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864\ncommon shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the\neffective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash,\ncanceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020\nPlan is 3.1 million. We may also grant shares under our shareholder-approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) for up to\n500,000 common shares.\nWe may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted\nshares, restricted stock units, performance shares, or ESPP shares.\nFor SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The\nmaximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes\nthe period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition.\nRestricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price\nthat may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-\nbased grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and\ncontingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that\napply to the underlying grants.\nWe record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, and ESPP shares\ngranted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of\nrestricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares\non the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date\nusing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and\nassumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected\nterm as estimated using the simplified method. We use the simplified method for SSAR grants because we believe historical exercise\ndata does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and\nSSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that\nutilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period\nterm and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility.\nInputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise\nfactor.\nWe record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the\ngraded vesting method. We record compensation expense for ESPP shares on a straight-line basis over the applicable offering period.\nWe record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an\noutput of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of\nour common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service\nperiod consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares, and ESPP shares included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nProduct development $ 7,380 $ 7,987 $ 8,186\nSales and marketing 831 1,044 1,355\nGeneral and administrative 5,900 3,927 5,008\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 14,111 $ 12,958 $ 14,549\nStock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights\nSSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date\nof exercise and the exercise price.

Once attainment of the\nperformance conditions becomes probable, we recognize compensation expense related to performance shares ratably over the\nperformance period. The number of performance shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant\ndate and settlement date, which are the same under the 2020 plan.\nBased on the performance conditions achieved as they relate to our annual bonus plan, management estimates a liability of $0.6\nmillion as of March 31, 2024, to be settled through the granting and vesting of performance shares after March 31, 2024. We\nrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares of $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.2 million in the fiscal years\nended March 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan Shares\nThe ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through regular payroll deductions, up to a specified percentage of their\neligible compensation. The ESPP is compensatory because, among other provisions, it currently allows participants to purchase stock\nat up to a 15% discount from the lower of the closing price of a share of our common stock on the first or last trading day of the ESPP\noffering period. We measure share-based compensation expense for the ESPP based on the fair value of the ESPP grant at the\nbeginning of the offering period. The fair value includes the value of the discount and the value associated with the call and put\noptions that take advantage of the variability in the common stock price during the offering period. We estimate the value of the call\nand put options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price of our common\nstock on the first date of the offering period and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected term, and expected\nvolatility of our common shares over the offering period based on historical volatility. We used the following inputs including\nprincipal assumptions for the following offering period reflected in our consolidated financial statements:\nOffering Period\nEnding\nJune 30, 2024\nGrant date fair value $ 81.60\nRisk-free interest rate over contractual term 5.36%\nExpected term (in years) 0.41\nExpected volatility 47.41%\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected\nterm of the ESPP shares. The expected term is the offering period, which is typically six months.\nWe record amounts withheld from participants during each offering period in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits in the\nconsolidated balance sheets until such shares are purchased. Amounts withheld from participants for the offering period ending June\n30, 2024 totaled $0.1 million as of March 31, 2024.\nAs of March 31, 2024, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to ESPP shares was $0.1 million, which is\nexpected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the offering period ending June 30, 2024.\n64\n14. Preferred Stock\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund\nI, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the\nInvestment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $35\nmillion. We incurred issuance costs of $1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance\nof the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One\nLLC.\nConversion\nOn November 24, 2023, at our option, we required conversion of all the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common\nstock. On November 27, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to\nthe Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to which the Convertible Preferred Stock was eliminated and returned to the status of\nauthorized and unissued preferred shares of the Company. Following the mandatory conversion of the outstanding shares of the\nConvertible Preferred Stock on November 24, 2023, there were no outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock.\nAccordingly, we removed the Series A convertible preferred stock, no par value from temporary equity on our consolidated balance\nsheet and recorded the associated increase of common shares at $0.30 stated value and capital in excess of stated value further\nreflected in our consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.\nDividends\nPrior to the conversion on November 24, 2023, the Holders were entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of\n5.25% per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation\nPreference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We paid dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors.\nAccounting Policy\nPrior to the conversion on November 24, 2023, we classified convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated\nbalance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that were at the election of the Holders. We increased the carrying value\nof the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value for all undeclared dividends using the interest method.\n65\n15. Business Combination\nOn January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a\nCanada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The\nconsolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our\nsolutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market.\nThe purchase price consisted of $22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $0.3 million of\nResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, $2.2 million of cash paid in March 2022 for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities, and $0.4\nmillion in cash received in January 2023 upon release of escrow funds resulting in net cash consideration of $24.1 million. We\nallocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based\non their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We\ndetermined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts\nthe expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to\nrecord certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered\nperformance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the\npurchase price, we recorded $2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying\nperformance obligations are delivered.\nThe following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite:\n(In thousands) Total\nComponents of Purchase Price:\nCash $ 24,405\nTotal purchase price $ 24,405\nAllocation of Purchase Price:\nNet tangible assets (liabilities):\nAccounts receivable, net $ 2,025\nOther current assets, including cash acquired 519\nOther assets 567\nCurrent and other liabilities (768)\nContract liabilities (2,835)\nDeferred income taxes, non-current (1,204)\nNet tangible assets (liabilities) (1,696)\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 9,634\nNon-competition agreements 848\nDeveloped technology 827\nTrade names 846\nTotal identifiable intangible assets 12,155\nGoodwill 13,946\nTotal purchase price allocation $ 24,405\nWe assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated\nuseful lives of 15 years, two years, five years, and five years, respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years.\nThe acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in\nwhich the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives.\nThe goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve\na broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. During the year ended March 31, 2023, we increased\ngoodwill by $0.8 million to record deferred income tax liabilities identified during the measurement period related to Canada tax\ntreatment of certain intangible assets and to record final working capital adjustments related to the purchase price. The acquisition\nresulted in the recognition of $13.9 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company recognized acquisition costs of $0.2 million and $0.5 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting\nprimarily of professional fees, during the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The consolidated statement of operations\nincludes these costs in other charges.\n66\nRevenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations was $4.8 million, $5.2 million, and\n$1.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The pro forma impact of the business combination\nduring the two years ended March 31, 2022 was not material to our historical consolidated operating results and is therefore not\npresented.\nEffective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc.\n16.

Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate\nController and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO, and PAO concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO,\nCFO, and PAO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO, CFO, and PAO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\nsupervision of our CEO, CFO, and PAO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of March 31, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on the evaluation, management concluded\nthat Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024.\nGrant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of March 31, 2024, which is included elsewhere in this annual report.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2024 that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our CEO, CFO, and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-\nmaking can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by\nindividual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls\nalso is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will\nsucceed in achieving its stated goals under all possible conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nOn January 25, 2024, Ramesh Srinivasan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan\non the terms, for the duration and for the aggregate number of shares as previously disclosed in Part II, Item 5 of the Company’s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n68\nAlso on January 25, 2024, MAK Capital One L.L.C.

All rights reserved. Page 2\nNEED FOR THE POLICY\nInsider trading. In general, \"insider trading\" is the purchase or sale of Securities (as defined\nbelow) made while in possession of material non-public information about the issuer of the\nSecurities (e.g., Agilysys, Inc.) in breach of a fiduciary duty. Insider trading is regarded as a\nserious violation of the federal securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\")\nhas made enforcement of the prohibitions on insider trading a top priority and has considerable\nresources at its disposal to detect and pursue suspected violators.\nWho may be liable. Although individuals remain the primary target of the SEC’s enforcement\nefforts, liability for insider trading is not limited to individuals. Under the Insider Trading and\nSecurities Fraud Enforcement Act enacted in 1988, companies and other \"controlling persons\"\nare potentially liable for insider trading violations by personnel of Agilysys, Inc. (the “Company”)\nand its subsidiaries. This means that the Company, Directors, or members of senior management\ncould be held liable under federal law for trades made on inside information by a Company\nemployee or contractor.\nThe consequences. The civil and criminal penalties for insider trading violations can be severe:\nFor individuals who trade on inside information, or who \"tip\" information to others,\n• A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained, or loss avoided.\n• A criminal fine (no matter how small the profit) of up to $5 million; and\n• Imprisonment for up to 20 years.\nFor a company, as well as any other controlling person that fails to take appropriate steps to\nprevent illegal trading,\n• A civil penalty of the greater of approximately $2.3 million (subject to annual increases)\nor three times the profit gained, or loss avoided as a result of a violation by personnel;\nand\n• A criminal penalty of up to $5 million (and up to $25 million for entities).\nThe non-legal consequences of insider trading can be as devastating. One can incur significant\nlegal expenses to defend against an SEC insider trading investigation and enforcement\nproceeding. Even an investigation that does not result in prosecution can irreparably tarnish one’s\nreputation and damage a career.\nThis insider trading policy (this “Policy”) has been adopted in response to the state of the law\nregarding insider trading, and the potential for serious harm to the Company and its personnel for\nactual or perceived violations of the law. The Policy is intended to provide a mechanism to prevent\ninsider trading by Company personnel, and moreover, to prevent even the appearance of\nimproper conduct by the Company. We have all worked hard over the years to establish the\nCompany’s reputation for integrity and ethical conduct. We cannot afford to have it damaged.\nSCOPE OF THE POLICY\nPersons Covered. This policy applies to all Directors, officers, and other employees (collectively,\n“Insiders”) of the Company and its subsidiaries and any contractors, consultants, or other outside\nparties (“Covered Outsiders”) who have access to material,non-public information regarding the\nCompany. This policy also applies to immediate family members of, and family members who\nshare their household with, an Insider or a Covered Outsider, as well as to any entities that an\nInsider or Covered Outsider influences or controls, including any corporations, limited liability\nMarch 1, 2024 | Copyright © 2024 by Agilysys NV, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 3\ncompanies, partnerships, or trusts (collectively with Insiders and Covered Outsiders, “Covered\nPersons”). It is the responsibility of each Insider and Covered Outsider to ensure that these other\nindividuals and entities comply with this Policy.\nApplicable Transactions. This Policy applies to any and all trading or other transactions,\nincluding gifts, transfers for estate planning purposes, hedging transactions, shorts sells, or any\noffer to purchase or sell, in (i) the Company's Securities (as defined below) and (ii) the Securities\nof certain other companies (“Business Partners”), including the Company's customers, vendors,\nsuppliers and any other company with which the Company has contractual relationships or may\nbe negotiating transactions, where the person trading used information about the Business\nPartner that was obtained in the course of employment with, or the performance of services on\nbehalf of, the Company.\n“Securities” means common stock, preferred stock, options, warrants, notes, bonds, convertible\nsecurities, derivative securities relating to any of the Company’s or a Business Partner’s\nsecurities, and any other securities that the Company or a Business Partner may issue.\nSTATEMENT OF THE GENERAL POLICY\nCovered Persons who possess material non-public information concerning the Company, or\nconcerning a Business Partner where such information is obtained in the course of employment\nwith, or the performance of services on behalf of, the Company, are prohibited from:\n• Directly or indirectly buying, selling, or trading or engaging in any transaction involving\nany Securities of the Company or a Business Partner; and\n• Disclosing (also known as \"tipping\") such material non-public information to others,\nincluding family members and friends, who may buy, sell, or trade any Securities of the\nCompany or a Business Partner.\n\"Material information\" means any information that a reasonable investor would regard as\nimportant in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold a security. Although the materiality of information\nwill depend on the circumstances of every case, below are some examples of information that\nwould generally be viewed as \"material\" to the Company or a Business Partner.\n• Financial performance, especially anticipated or actual quarterly and year end revenues\nand earnings, and significant changes in financial performance or liquidity\n• Projects and strategic plans\n• Declarations of stock splits and dividends\n• Potential mergers and acquisitions or the sale of assets or subsidiaries\n• New major contracts, product lines, suppliers, customers or finance sources, or the loss\nof any of these\n• Significant product or services pricing changes\n• Significant changes in senior management\n• Actual or threatened major litigation, or the resolutions of such litigation.\n• Proposed strategic alliances or partnering arrangements.\n• Proposed issuances of new Securities\n\"Non-public information\" is information about a company that has not yet been widely\ndisseminated to the marketplace through such means as SEC filings, newswire services or\nfinancial news services. For purposes of this policy, information that has been so disseminated\nMarch 1, 2024 | Copyright © 2024 by Agilysys NV, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 4\nwill be considered non-public until the close of trading on the first full day following the public\ndissemination.\nADDITIONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS FOR CERTAIN PERSONS\nTo facilitate compliance with the Company’s general policy and avoid even the appearance of\nimpropriety, the Company has adopted the following, additional restrictions (“Additional\nRestrictions”) with respect to trading in Company Securities by or on behalf of stockholders who,\nthrough their position or status with the Company, have continuing access to material non-public\ninformation regarding the Company.\nAll Directors and officers are required to abide by these Additional Restrictions in addition\nto the terms of the general policy. These Additional Restrictions also may be imposed from\ntime to time on any other Company employee or Covered Outsider who any elected officer\ndetermines has access to such information in the ordinary course of his or her\nemployment or services (collectively with all directors and elected officers, the “Restricted\nPersons”).\nPursuant to the Company’s general policy, no Covered Person may trade or otherwise effect\nany transactions in Company Securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public\ninformation concerning the Company even during a “trading window” (as defined below).\nTrading window. No Restricted Person may trade or otherwise effect transactions in the\nCompany’s Securities except during quarterly “trading windows.” Unless the Company has\nestablished a “blackout period” (described below), the trading window will open on the first trading\ndate after the first full day of trading following the Company’s public release of quarterly or year-\nend earnings and will close at the close of trading on the last trading date that is at least two\nweeks (14 days) prior to the end of the fiscal quarter.\nBlackout periods. The Company may designate blackout periods during which trading in\nCompany Securities is prohibited because of the existence of material non-public information.\nWhen a blackout period is in effect, the trading window will remain closed until the Company\ndetermines to terminate the blackout period. The Company will provide written notice to all\npersons to whom these restrictions may apply of any blackout period that has been established\nand the termination of any blackout period.\nPre-Clearance Procedures.All trades or other transactions by Restricted Persons involving the\nCompany’s Securities, other than excepted transactions set forth below, must be cleared in writing\nby the Company’s General Counsel prior to the execution of such trades or other transactions. A\nrequest for pre-clearance must be submitted in writing to the Company’s General Counsel at least\ntwo business days before the proposed trade or other transaction. Such pre-clearance will enable\nthe Company to assure that trades or other transactions are compliant with this Policy and will\nfacilitate timely preparation and submission of any regulatory filings required as a result of such\ntrades.\nExpiration of Pre-Clearance. The approval by the Company’s General Counsel of any proposed\ntrade or other transaction pursuant to the pre-clearance procedures set forth above will expire\nfive trading days after receipt of such approval. If the authorized trade or other transaction is not\neffected within that five-trading day period, the Restricted Person must reapply for approval of the\nMarch 1, 2024 | Copyright © 2024 by Agilysys NV, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 5\nproposed trade or other transaction in accordance with the pre-clearance procedures set forth\nabove.\nEXCEPTIONS\nStock Option Exercises. The trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy do not\napply to purchases of Company stock through a cash exercise of an option granted under a\nCompany equity compensation plan at its stated exercise price that does not involve the sale of\nCompany Securities to fund the exercise price or tax obligations owed in connection with such\nexercise. However, any sale of stock acquired through such an exercise would be subject to the\ntrading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy, including, with respect to Restricted\nPersons, the Additional Restrictions.\nAutomatic ESPP Purchases. For Covered Persons eligible to participate in the Company’s\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), the trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in\nthis Policy do not apply to purchases of Company stock through periodic, automatic payroll\ncontributions to the ESPP pursuant to a Covered Person’s advance instructions. However,\nelecting to enroll in the ESPP, making any changes in elections under the ESPP and selling any\nCompany stock acquired under the ESPP are subject to the trading prohibitions and restrictions\nset forth in this Policy, including, with respect to Restricted Persons, the Additional Restrictions.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act establishes a safe harbor for\nliability under Rule 10b-5 for trades or other transactions in the Company’s Securities by persons\nthat are made pursuant to a written plan that was adopted at a time when the person was not\naware of material nonpublic information and that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. The\ntrading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy do not apply to transactions in Company\nSecurities effected in accordance with the provisions of a pre-existing, properly established Rule\n10b5-1 trading plan. A properly established Rule 10b5-1 Plan must meet all the requirements set\nforth in the section below titled “Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans.” Note that the\nadoption, amendment, or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan remains subject to the trading\nprohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy, including, with respect to Restricted Persons,\nthe Additional Restrictions.\nREQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 PLANS\nAs indicated above, the trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy do not apply to\ntransactions in Company Securities effected pursuant to a pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 plan that\nmeets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and any additional requirements set forth in this Policy,\nincluding the following:\n• The plan must be entered into or amended at a time when the person covered by such\nplan is not aware of material nonpublic information.\n• The plan must be entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to\nevade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, and the person who entered into the plan must\nhave acted in good faith with respect to the plan.\n• With respect to Restricted Persons, such policy must be adopted during an open trading\nwindow and be expressly authorized by the Company’s General Counsel. With respect\nto all Covered Persons, such policy must not be adopted during any blackout period.\n• With respect to directors and officers of the Company, such director or officer must\nprovide a written certification at the time of adoption or amendment of the plan that such\ndirector or officer (i) is not aware of material nonpublic information about the Company\nMarch 1, 2024 | Copyright © 2024 by Agilysys NV, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 6\nor its Securities and (ii) is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or\nscheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1.\n• The person covered by such plan must not exercise any influence over the amount of\nSecurities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade.\nThe plan must either specify (including by formula) the amount, pricing, and timing of\ntransactions in advance, or delegate discretion on those matters to an independent third\nparty not under such person’s control or influence.\n• The plan must provide that trading will not begin until the expiration of the applicable\ncooling-off period as required by law.\n• In general, a person may not have multiple 10b5-1 plans regarding the purchase or sale\nof the Company’s Securities existing during the same period with the same broker\n(commonly referred to as “overlapping plans”). A series of separate contracts with\ndifferent broker-dealers or other agents acting on behalf of such person to execute\ntrades may be treated as a single Rule 10b5-1 plan, provided that all of the individual\ncontracts, when taken together as a whole, meet the applicable conditions and remain\nsubject to Rule 10b5-1.\nCONSEQUENCES OF POLICY VIOLATIONS\nYou are responsible for adhering to the provisions and procedures of the Policy. Your failure to\ndo so may result in disciplinary or other action by the Company, including, without limitation, your\ndismissal for cause.\nPlease direct any questions regarding the application of the Policy to the Company’s General\nCounsel.\nMarch 1, 2024 | Copyright © 2024 by Agilysys NV, LLC.

Robertson\nChris J. Robertson\nCorporate Controller and Treasurer\n(Principal Accounting Officer)\nAGILYSYS, INC. (the “Company”)\nINCENTIVE COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\n1. Introduction\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has adopted this Incentive Compensation\nRecovery Policy (this “Policy”) to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608, which provides for the\nrecovery of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement resulting\nfrom material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws.\n2. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the\n“Committee”). Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all\naffected individuals.\n3. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth\nbelow:\n(a) “Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement (i) due to the\nmaterial noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in\npreviously issued financial restatements that is material to the previously issued financial\nstatements (a “Big R” restatement), or (ii) that corrects an error that is not material to previously\nissued financial statements, but would result in a material misstatement if the error were not\ncorrected the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement).\n(b) “Covered Executives” means the Company's current and former Executive\nOfficers, as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act\nand the listing standards of Nasdaq, and such other senior executives and employees who may\nfrom time to time be deemed subject to this Policy by the Committee.\n(c) “Effective Date” means November 4, 2023.\n(d) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, with respect to each Covered\nExecutive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recovery Eligible\nIncentive-based Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-based Compensation that\notherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts,\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid.\n(e) “Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n(f) “Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer,\nprincipal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-\npresident of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales,\nadministration or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other\nperson (including any executive officer of the Company’s affiliates) who performs similar policy-\nmaking functions for the Company. The term “Executive Officer” includes, without limitation,\nthose officers identified by the Company in any disclosure made pursuant to the requirements of\nRegulation S-K Item 401(b).\n(g) “Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and\npresented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial\nstatements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock\nprice and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock\nprice or total shareholder return) shall for purposes of this Policy be considered Financial\nReporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a Financial Reporting Measure need not be\npresented in the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n(h) “Incentive-based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned\nor vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n(i) “Nasdaq” means The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n(j) “Received” – Incentive-based Compensation shall be deemed “Received” in the\nCompany’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-\nbased Compensation award is attained, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-based\nCompensation occurs after the end of that period.\n(k) “Recovery Eligible Incentive-based Compensation” means, in connection with\nan Accounting Restatement and with respect to each individual who served as a Covered Executive\nat any time during the applicable performance period for any Incentive-based Compensation\n(whether or not such Covered Executive is serving at the time the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is required to be repaid to the Company), all Incentive-based Compensation\nReceived by such Covered Executive (i) on or after the Effective Date, (ii) after beginning service\nas a Covered Executive, (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association, and (iv) during the applicable Recovery\nPeriod.\n(l) “Recovery Period” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three\ncompleted fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months\nwithin or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n(m) “Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (i) (A) the date the Board, or (B)\nthe date a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if\nBoard action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company\nis required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, and (ii) the date a court, regulator or other\nlegally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n(n) “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n2\n4. Repayment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation; Method of Recovery\n(a) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall take reasonably\nprompt action after the Restatement Date to determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation for each Covered Executive in connection with such Accounting Restatement and,\nthereafter, shall promptly provide each Covered Executive with a written notice containing the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as\napplicable. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total\nshareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting\nRestatement, the amount shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of\nthe effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which\nthe Incentive-based Compensation was Received (in which case the Company shall maintain\ndocumentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation\nto Nasdaq).\n(b) The Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of\nrecovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and circumstances\nand taking into account the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery,\nincluding without limitation (i) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-based Compensation\npreviously paid; (ii) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale,\ntransfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (iii) offsetting the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to\nthe Covered Executive; (iv) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or (v)\ntaking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, except\nas set forth in Section 4(d) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than\nthe amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Executive’s\nobligations hereunder.\n(c) To the extent that a Covered Executive fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation to the Company when due (as determined in accordance with Section 4(b) above),\nthe Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Executive. The applicable Covered\nExecutive shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred\n(including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in\naccordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required\nto take the actions contemplated by Section 4(b) above if the following conditions are met and the\nCommittee determines that recovery would be impracticable:\n(i) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy\nagainst a Covered Executive would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has\nmade a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously Awarded Compensation,\ndocumented such attempts and provided such documentation to Nasdaq;\n3\n(ii) recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior\nto November 28, 2022; provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover\nany amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the\nCompany has obtained an opinion of home country counsel (acceptable to Nasdaq) that recovery\nwould result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\n5. Acknowledgement by Covered Executives\nThe Committee shall provide notice of this Policy to, and seek written acknowledgement of this\nPolicy from, each Covered Executive in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A; provided that the\nfailure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the\napplicability or enforceability of this Policy.\n6. Reporting and Disclosure\nThe Company shall make all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the\nrequirements of the U.S. federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by applicable\nSEC filings.\n7. No Indemnification\nNotwithstanding the terms of any of the Company’s organizational documents, any corporate\npolicy or any contract, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss\nof any Erroneously Awarded Compensation or any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement\nof its rights under this Policy nor shall the Company pay or reimburse any Covered executive for\nany insurance premium to cover the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n8. Interpretation\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations\nnecessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this\nPolicy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the\nExchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC or any national securities\nexchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed.\n9. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Date.\n10. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy\nas it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the SEC under Section 10D of the\nExchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by any national securities\n4\nexchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. The\nBoard may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or\ntermination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking\ninto account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or\ntermination) cause the Company to violate any U.S. federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules\nof any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed.\n11. Other Recovery Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee\nmay require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement\nentered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit\nthereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of\nrecovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of\nrecovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant\nto the terms of any similar policy, whether or not included in any employment agreement, equity\naward agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies or rights available to the\nCompany.\n12. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n5\nExhibit A\nAGILYSYS, INC.

Business.\nOverview\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative state-of-the-art cloud-native SaaS and\non-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities,\nstadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and\nprocurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its\nworld-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest\nloyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle\nEast, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2023\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\nHistory and Significant Events\nOrganized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic\ncomponents and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial\nElectronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring\nbusinesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we\nchanged our name to Agilysys, Inc.\nIn fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology\nsolutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.\nIn fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to\nshareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis,\nInc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the\nhospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of\napplications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust\nsolutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations.\nIn fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth\nopportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating\ncorporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining\noperating units.\nIn fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital\nGroup, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth\nopportunities in the hospitality market.\nIn fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.\nWe converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022.\nToday, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest and staff experiences and allow our\ncustomers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs\nand increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy,\nintegrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective\nmanagement, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.\n4\nOur strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and\nmaintenance agreements, and professional services.\nProducts, Support and Professional Services\nWe are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software\nsolutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; subscription and maintenance; and professional services.\nAreas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core\nsolutions.\nWe present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories:\n• Products\n• Subscription and maintenance\n• Professional services\nTotal revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProducts $ 43,638 $ 35,956 $ 26,714\nSubscription and maintenance 118,285 98,958 88,565\nProfessional services 36,142 27,722 21,897\nTotal $ 198,065 $ 162,636 $ 137,176\nProducts: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems.\nSoftware sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’\nability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by\nthe ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third\nparty solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as\nstaff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven\nby new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases.\nSubscription and Maintenance: Software subscription and maintenance services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue\nand typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and\npromoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to\nreinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to\noptimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.\nProfessional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions\ninto both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and\nfast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive\nexperience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve\nmaximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.\nOur portfolio of hospitality software solutions:\nThe hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the\nindustry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos.

While the size of the\nopportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it remains in the billions of dollars while our business represents\nonly a fraction of that size. We are well positioned to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry.\nCustomers\nOur customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or\ndepartments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of\n12\ncustomer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly\nfragmented.\nHuman Capital\nAs of March 31, 2023, we employed approximately 1,600 employees, with approximately 66%, 30%, 3%, and 1% of our employees\nlocated in India, North America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good\nand a critical factor in our success.\nOur senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a\npassion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive\ncompensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development.

Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with\ncustomers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service.\nWe compete with other full-service providers who sell and deliver bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of software, hardware,\nsubscription, maintenance, and professional services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle\nCorp., Shiji, Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies who prodive either POS or PMS\nsolutions like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such\ncompliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.\nAccess to Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports\nare available free of charge through our corporate website, http://www.agilysys.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such\nmaterial is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMarkets, Competition, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions.\nBecause we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including\nin areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine\nwar), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening\n13\nof, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or\npotential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay,\ndecrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously\npurchased products and services.\nOur business is negatively impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in\nenergy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in\nair travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption\nof businesses and supply chains worldwide. The resulting travel, work and social restrictions along with actions by governmental\nauthorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in global economic activity and global trade. While\nCOVID-19 restrictions have since eased globally, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or a future pandemic, depending on its\nduration and severity, could materially adversely impact the global economy and our industry, operations and financial condition and\nperformance. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially\nimpacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities.\nSimilarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which\nmay adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the\nsupply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with\ninternational supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international\ntrade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs,\nincluding on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply\ncosts, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market\nacceptance.\nOur business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order\nto remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the\ninvestment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are\notherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new\nproducts or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at\nall, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and\nresources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n• Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n• Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers;\nand\n• Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware\nproducts, such as mobile devices.\nOur product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of\ntime, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related\nproduct opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will,\nif ever, receive significant revenues from these investments.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not\ntechnologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price\nreductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nSeveral companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes\nit likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our\n14\ncompetitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems\nintegration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete\neffectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to\nreduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or\nservices, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price\nmodifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to\ncontend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could\nadversely affect our revenues and liquidity.\nOur future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our\nbusiness and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-\nterm strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions.\nInvestments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, research and development, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion,\nand headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a\nsignificant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in\nresearch and development may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate.\nHowever, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in\nnew areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term.\nTo be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among\nopportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new\nareas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with\nthe new solutions, in which we have invested.\nOur success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure,\nsystems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new\nimplementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems\nduring or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and\ninfrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs.\nWe do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services\nneeds from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner\nprograms, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it\nmay have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business\nmay be impaired and our financial results may suffer.\nWe depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we\nmust retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry\nchallenge given the competitive technology labor market. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on\nnew and larger opportunities and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate\nand may be limited especially in technology areas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or\nfinancial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. If we are unable to attract and retain\nqualified personnel when and where they are needed, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we\nare not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nWhile the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even\ntighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or\n15\nincreasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs\noutpace our revenue growth.\nOur international operations have many associated risks.\nWe continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention\nand financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance\nthat we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and\nchallenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial\ncondition.\nWe have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Dubai, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and\nIndia. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support\nchannels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and\ndifficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing\nintegrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and\ncollecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in\nsome countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; inflation and any\nregulatory actions to counter inflation; and political and economic instability abroad.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research\nand development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our\nadministrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is\nconcentrated in our India research and development center. While we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, a\nnatural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location\nthat prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers.\nRegulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality\nCyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nWe have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data\nagainst cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon\nwhom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported\nactors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in\nour systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in\nthe design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems,\nand those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses,\ncredential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized\naccess to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.\nThe number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including\nsophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks,\nanticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain\nundetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained\ntherein, our customers and ultimately, our business.\nThese events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally\nidentifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our\nability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\n16\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with\napplicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as\ntheir and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable\ninformation is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security\nsuch as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what\nconstitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by\njurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their\napplicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to\ncomply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or\npotential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions,\ncomplaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities.\nOur software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be\npossible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the\ncustomer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry\nsecurity requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and\nimplementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our\nsoftware can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software,\nour business could be adversely affected.\nFor certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create\nsignificant risk exposure for us.\nWe maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other\ncloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these\nproviders with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If\nthese third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other\ndifficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs,\npotential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate\nthese services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it\ncould result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially\nadversely impact our business.\nWe also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our\ncompetitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be\nsmaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in\nan effort to benefit our margins.\nIf any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any\nother disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a\ncompetitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of\nUkraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the\napplicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any\nof which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish\ncontractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in\nobtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to\nstand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our\nrelationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to\nprotect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary\ntechnology.\n17\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual\nproperty or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by\nother parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase\nand overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the\nattention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the\nconduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we\nreceive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe\npatents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on\nelectronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for\nus and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement.\nIf we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal\nliability.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high\nquality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be\ndamaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions,\nbreaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions\nor breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses.\nIn addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include\nprovisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately\nprotect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for\nerrors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be\navailable on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not\ndisclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available\ninsurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.\nRisks Relating to the Industries We Serve\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of\nthat industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality\nindustry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit\nthe industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products.\nConsolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other\ncompanies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry.\nAlthough recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance\nthat future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a\ncompany that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services\nfrom us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nInsolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our\ncustomers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property.\nCustomers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements\n18\nwith us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and\nliquidity could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nOur stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low close of $32.41 to a high close of\n$87.33. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this\nsection, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n• uncertainties in the global economy;\n• economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;\n• our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of\nsecurities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial\nrelationships or capital commitments;\n• our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; and\n• any major change in our board or management\n• general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations\nand acts of war or terrorism.\nOn May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a\nconversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the\nprice of our common stock.\nAdditionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the\nvolatility of our common share price over time.\nIf we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.\nAs part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek\nacquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such\nacquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen\ndifficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired\nbusinesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.\nOur financial results may be significantly impacted by changes in our tax position.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be impacted by\nchanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets\n(including our net operating loss carryforwards), changes in unrecognized tax benefits, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nAny of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, including the United States, may from time to time review the pricing arrangements between us and our foreign\nsubsidiaries or among our foreign subsidiaries. An adverse determination by one or more tax authorities in this regard may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets which can provide us with significant future cash tax savings if we are able to use them,\nincluding significant net operating losses. However, the extent to which we will be able to use these net operating losses may be\nimpacted, restricted, or eliminated by a number of factors, including changes in tax rates, laws or regulations, and whether we generate\nsufficient future taxable income. To the extent that we are unable to utilize our net operating losses or other losses, our results of\noperations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. When we cease to have net operating losses\navailable to us in a particular tax jurisdiction, either through their expiration, disallowance, or utilization, our cash tax liability will\nincrease in that jurisdiction.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could negatively impact our financial results.\n19\nWe earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets, and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the\nBritish pound sterling, euro, Indian rupee, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar, and Canadian dollar, among others. Because our\nconsolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of entities\nusing non-U.S. dollar functional currencies into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each\nreporting period, meaning that we are exposed to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, the revaluation and\nsettlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar impact our net income with\nassociated gains or losses recorded within other income (expense), net.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from\nour customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies\nare included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these\ncontingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially\nimpact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had $32.6 million of goodwill and $18.1 million of intangible assets, net, on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more\nfrequently if an event or events indicate the potential for impairment. We assess as needed whether there have been impairments in our\nother intangible assets. We make assumptions and estimates in our assessments that can be complex and subjective. In our\nassumptions and estimates we consider whether negative factors exist such as deteriorating economic conditions, disruptions to our\nbusiness, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, intensified competition, market capitalization declines, or significant\nchanges in use of the intangible assets. To the extent that such factors or other negative factors emerge, we may record non-cash\nimpairment charges in the future that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.\nWhile we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront\ncredit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess\nof federally insured amounts, if any.\nOther Risk Factors\nWe are subject to litigation, which may be costly.\nAs a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such\nlitigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take\nsteps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact\non our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business.\nWhile we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the\nobjectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In\naddition, we lease approximately 36,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 30,000 square feet of office space in\nBellevue, Washington, of which we sublease 22,000 square feet to a third party, 5,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara,\n20\nCalifornia, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 101,000 square feet\nof office space in Chennai, India, 7,000 square feet in Toronto, Canada, and lease several other smaller office locations throughout\nEurope and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe our office space facilities are\nsufficient to meet our current needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging\nthat certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g.,\nrestaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was\nconsolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the\ncase were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the\none surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was\naffirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were\nnot asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In\nDecember 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth\nappealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although on May 11, 2022,\njudgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the\njudgement.\nAt this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary\nexposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in\nthis matter.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n21\nPart II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. As of May 12,\n2023, there were 1,233 registered holders of our common shares, without par value.\nDividends\nWe did not pay dividends in fiscal 2023 or 2022 on our common stock and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. We pay\npreferred stock dividends as described in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report. The current practice of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations and growth\nof our business, both organically and through acquisitions.\nShareholder Return Performance Presentation\nThe following chart compares the value of $100 invested in our common shares, including reinvestment of dividends, with a similar\ninvestment in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) and with the companies listed in the SIC Code 7373-Computer Integrated\nSystems Design for the period March 31, 2018 through March 31, 2023.

Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the\ngeneral financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including:\n— what factors affect our business;\n— what our earnings and costs were;\n— why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;\n— where the earnings came from;\n— how our financial condition was affected; and\n— where the cash will come from to fund future operations.\nThe MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nInformation provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could\ncause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking\nInformation” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information\nconcerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about\ninvesting in Agilysys.\nOverview\nRecent Developments\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, influenced by a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, inflation,\nand the erosion of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We believe such conditions are impacting customer spending and\nprovider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the\nUnited States.\nOur Business\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative state-of-the-art cloud-native SaaS and\non-premise guest-centric technology solutions.

Total revenue increased $35.4 million, or 21.8%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Products revenue increased $7.7\nmillion, or 21.4%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and\nmaintenance revenue increased $19.3 million, or 19.5%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased\n27.5% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Professional services revenue increased $8.4 million, or 30.4%, due to higher sales and\nservice activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations.\nGross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $19.3 million, or 19.0%, in fiscal 2023 and total gross profit\nmargin decreased from 62.4% to 61.0%. Products gross profit increased $3.9 million and gross profit margin increased from 46.5% to\n47.3% due to a higher proportion of proprietary software revenue over third-party products. Subscription and maintenance gross profit\nincreased $14.2 million and gross profit margin decreased from 78.6% to 77.8% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related\nrevenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.1 million and gross profit margin decreased from 25.3% to 22.6% reflecting\nlower utilization rates due to higher non-billable hours on new, more complex solution implementations over the comparable annual\nperiods.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and other charges, increased $14.5 million, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2023\ncompared with fiscal 2022. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 2.9% in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal\n2022.\nProduct development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development\nincreased $3.9 million, or 8.5%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to hiring and higher salary and incentive rates\nacross our development teams, increased travel, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing arrangements.\n27\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $8.0 million, or 54.2%, in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 due to various\nsales and marketing investments including several key hires, significantly higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and\nincreased commission expense on higher sales levels.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative increased $2.9 million, or 10.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due\nto investments in our information security and information technology infrastructure along with hiring and increased salary and\nincentive rates across our administrative teams, higher rent, increased travel, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing\narrangements.\nDepreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.4 million or 20.0% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022\ndue to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives.\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles increased $0.1 million or\n5.4% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the addition of certain intangible assets that began amortizing in January 2022\nsubsequent to the acquisition of ResortSuite Inc. (ResortSuite) as described in Note 15, Business Combination, to our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOther charges. Other charges decreased $1.1 million due to a significant reduction in non-recurring charges including ResortSuite\nacquisition costs during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nLegal settlements. Legal settlements decreased $0.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to an decrease in\nsettlements of employment and other business-related matters.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nYear ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income $ 2,192 $ 59 $ (2,133) nm\nInterest (expense) — (12) (12) nm\nOther income, net 697 145 (552) nm\nTotal other income, net $ 2,889 $ 192 $ (2,697) nm\nnm – not meaningful\nInterest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper,\ntreasury bills and money market funds.\nInterest (expense). Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases.\nOther income, net. Other income, net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Taxes\nYear ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nIncome tax expense $ 1,182 $ 33 $ (1,149) nm\nEffective tax rate 7.5% 0.5%\nnm – not meaningful\nFor fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including\ndecreases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets.\nWe are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of\ntax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in\nunrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the next 12 months.\n28\nBecause of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company's deferred\ntax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during\nthe future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. As of March 31, 2023, we had $132.0 million of\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to 2039, and $43.8 million of federal net operating\nloss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $133.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that\nexpire, if unused, in fiscal years 2024 through 2042. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient\nevidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we\nbelieve it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant\nportion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of\ncertain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits.\nFiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021\nNet Revenue and Operating Loss\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended March 31, Increase (decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ %\nNet revenue:\nProducts $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 9,242 34.6%\nSubscription and maintenance 98,958 88,565 10,393 11.7%\nProfessional services 27,722 21,897 5,825 26.6%\nTotal net revenue 162,636 137,176 25,460 18.6%\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts, inclusive of developed technology amortization 19,251 13,506 5,745 42.5%\nSubscription and maintenance 21,141 17,985 3,156 17.5%\nProfessional services 20,712 16,309 4,403 27.0%\nTotal cost of goods sold 61,104 47,800 13,304 27.8%\nGross profit $ 101,532 $ 89,376 $ 12,156 13.6%\nGross profit margin 62.4% 65.2%\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development $ 46,332 $ 55,345 $ (9,013) (16.3)%\nSales and marketing 14,730 14,196 534 3.8%\nGeneral and administrative 27,734 33,273 (5,539) (16.6)%\nDepreciation of fixed assets 2,210 2,832 (622) (22.0)%\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,654 1,959 (305) (15.6)%\nOther charges 1,584 2,529 (945) (37.4)%\nLegal settlements 969 200 769 384.5%\nOperating income (loss) $ 6,319 $ (20,958) $ 27,277 (130.2)%\nOperating income (loss) percentage 3.9% (15.3)%\n29\nThe following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated\nnet revenues for the periods presented:\nYear ended March 31,\n2022 2021\nNet revenue:\nProducts 22.1% 19.5%\nSubscription and maintenance 60.8 64.6\nProfessional services 17.1 15.9\nTotal net revenue 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts, inclusive of developed technology amortization 11.8% 9.8%\nSubscription and maintenance 13.0 13.1\nProfessional services 12.8 11.9\nTotal cost of goods sold 37.6% 34.8%\nGross profit 62.4% 65.2%\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development 28.4% 40.4%\nSales and marketing 9.1 10.3\nGeneral and administrative 17.1 24.4\nDepreciation of fixed assets 1.4 2.1\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.0 1.4\nOther charges 1.0 1.8\nLegal settlements 0.5 0.1\nOperating income (loss) 3.9% (15.3)%\nNet revenue.

General and administrative decreased $5.5 million, or 16.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due\nto an increase of $3.7 million in payroll and other expenses after restoring base pay, employee benefits and various operational\nactivities offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million due to significant charges resulting from the\naccelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021.\nDepreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.6 million or 22.0% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021\ndue to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives.\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.3 million or\n15.6% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal\n2020.\nOther charges.

We are\nconsistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.\nBecause of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred tax\nassets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the\nfuture periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. At March 31, 2022, we had $196.3 million of federal net\noperating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $42.8 million of federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that\nexpire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023 through 2041.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our\ncontractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease\nobligations in Note 6, Leases, and preferred stock dividends in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAt March 31, 2023, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 93% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank\naccounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of\nacquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other\nobservable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other\nobservable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash\nequivalents.\nWe believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $112.8 million as of March 31, 2023, and access to capital\nmarkets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements.\nCash Flow\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 34,463 $ 28,475 $ 28,407\nInvesting activities (6,870) (25,679) (1,391)\nFinancing activities (11,094) (4,901) 25,316\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (628) (104) 195\n(Decrease) increase in cash $ 15,871 $ (2,209) $ 52,527\nCash flow provided by operating activities.

We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life\ninsurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in\nthese corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance\nsheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining\npolicies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated\nbeneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets at the balance sheet date.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect\non our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,\nor capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nsignificant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments,\nintangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies\ndiscussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because\ntheir application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on\nestimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in\nthe following paragraphs.\nFor all these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely\nrequire adjustment.\nRevenue recognition. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The\nmajority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms\nand conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different\n33\ngoods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each\nindividual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and\nservices that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the\ncontract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange\nfor transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or\nrefund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or\nrefund.\nTypically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide\nsignificant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The\nsoftware is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical\nsupport. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software\nrevenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the\nsupplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at\nthe point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of\nsale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from\nthe software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the\nsoftware, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance\nobligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the\ncontract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and\nrenewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nWe derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for\nour proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes\nthe same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the\ncontract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of\npayment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services\nare being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s\nability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or\nservices in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\nWe use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies.\n34\nShare-based compensation. We have an equity incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock\noptions, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant\nto awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares.\nWe record compensation expense related to stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and\nperformance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date.\nThe fair value of restricted share and restricted stock unit grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our\ncommon shares on the grant date. For stock option and stock-settled appreciation right grants subject only to a service condition, we\nestimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing\nmarket price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common\nshares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share, restricted stock\nunit and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model\nthat utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance\nperiod term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical\nvolatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and\nsuboptimal exercise factor. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used\nto value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation, to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional information about accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services\ninternationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises\nfrom exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from international operations was 7%, 7% and 8%,\nrespectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of\noperations for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue,\nexpenses, operating profit and net income.\n35\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(“COSO”), and our report dated May 19, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 19, 2023\n37\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nAgilysys, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, and our report dated\nMay 19, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 19, 2023\n38\nAGILYSYS, INC.

Nature of Operations\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise\nsolutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and\nhealthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement,\npayments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world-class\ncustomer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty,\ndrive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-\nPacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within the fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2023\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments\nin affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been\neliminated.\nUse of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported\nperiods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of\nthree months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity\ndate are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the same or following\nbusiness day after instruction to redeem. Cash equivalent investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include\ncertificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Commercial paper cash\nequivalents totaled $5.0 million and $15.0 million as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We determine the fair\nvalue of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs (level 2) based on pricing from independent sources that use\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates.\nAllowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the\ninability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical\nexperience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we\nperform periodic credit evaluations of our customers.\nCustomer credit allowance. We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount\nof customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many\ncases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we\ninvoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested\nby the customer within the terms of our contract.\nInventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of\nrelated reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure\nappropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual\nprovisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change\nand/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations\nmay be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of\nhistorical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\n44\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”)\nassets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-\ncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities\nare included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right\nto use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset\nfor the duration of the lease term.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease\npayments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing\nsince our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease\neconomic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives\nreceived or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income\non a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have\nleases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index\nor rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have\na term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material\nimpact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party\ntransactions associated with our lease agreements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net\nassets of acquired companies. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill was $32.6 million and $32.8 million,\nrespectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist,\nbased on our one reporting unit. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based\non its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. The Company is also required to\ncompare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events\nand circumstances require an interim assessment. The Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite-\nlived assets has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAcquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include identifiable customer relationships, non-competition agreements,\ndeveloped technology, and trade names. We amortize the cost of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful\nlives, which are periods of 15 years or less, primarily on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the\nassets are utilized. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are determined\nprimarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows attributable to these assets to present value using\nestimates and assumptions determined by management.\nLong-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor\nreplacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of,\nthe cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under\nfinance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.\nThe estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years;\nfurniture – 7 to 10 years; equipment – 3 to 10 years; software – 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the\neconomic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts\ncapitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s\ncompletion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying\namounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future\nundiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in\nNote 4, Property and Equipment, Net.\nForeign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting\npurposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the\nperiod-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The\ncumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within shareholders’\nequity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional\n45\ncurrency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign\ncurrency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results.\nRevenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating\nsystems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. For the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from\ninternational operations was 7%, 7% and 8%, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented.\nOur customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts\nare governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any\nindividual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services,\nthe associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract\nare defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be\ntransferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction\nprice is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or\nservices to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain\nthe contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund.\nTypically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide\nsignificant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The\nsoftware is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical\nsupport. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software\nrevenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified\nby the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon\nreceipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of\nsale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from\nthe software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the\nsoftware, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance\nobligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the\ncontract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and\nrenewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nWe derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for\nour proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes\nthe same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the\ncontract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of\npayment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services\nare being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s\nability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or\nservices in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\n46\nWe use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies.\nComprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is the total of net income (loss), as currently reported under GAAP, plus\nother comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) considers the effects of additional transactions and economic\nevents that are not required to be recorded in determining net income (loss), but rather are reported as a separate statement of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nFair value measurements. We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial\nassets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event\noccurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques.\nInvestments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some\nare endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we\nmust maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated\nbeneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which\napproximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender\nvalue of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed\nto those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current\nliabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10,\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We\nrecognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in\nthe periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that\nsome portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is\nmade on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical\ntaxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the\nimplementation of tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax\npositions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is\nrecognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable\nunder relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9,\nIncome Taxes.\nAdvertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense\nwas $4.8 million, $2.6 million and $0.4 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nManagement continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial\nstatements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting\npronouncements.\n47\n3. Revenue Recognition\nFor in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating\nsystems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $43.6\nmillion, $36.0 million, and $26.7 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized over time (subscription and\nmaintenance, and professional services) totaled $154.4 million, $126.7 million, and $110.5 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nContract Balances\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is\nconditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to\nproducts and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We\nreceive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to\nconsideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally\ndue from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract.\nRevenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $45.3 million and $38.1 million\nduring fiscal 2023 and 2022. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $1.7\nmillion and $2.4 million, respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional.\nOur arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2023 are\nexpected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract\nSales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a\ncontract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred\nwhen the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an\nagreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally\nbased on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses\nare immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one\nyear or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected.\nWe had $3.9 million and $3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances\nare included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we expensed $3.6 million\nand $2.5 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $1.3 million and $1.2\nmillion, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred.\n4. Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment at March 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nFurniture and equipment $ 12,097 $ 14,632\nSoftware 15,989 16,338\nLeasehold improvements 5,656 7,123\nFacilities construction in progress 9,721 17\n43,463 38,110\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (28,887) (31,765)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 14,576 $ 6,345\n48\nTotal depreciation expense on property and equipment was $1.8 million, $2.2 million, and $2.8 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nThe Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software purchased and used exclusively in providing services or that is\nonly made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Total\namortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $0.6 million, $1.3 million and $2.0 million during fiscal 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\nAssets under financing leases are included in property and equipment categories above and further disclosed with Note 6. Leases.\n5. Intangible Assets, Goodwill, and Software Development Costs\nThe following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2023, and 2022:\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2022\nGross Net Gross Net\ncarrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying\n(In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount amount amortization impairment amount\nFinite-lived intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships $ 19,809 $ (11,529) $ — $ 8,280 $ 20,391 $ (10,938) $ — $ 9,453\nNon-competition agreements 3,487 (3,192) — 295 3,547 (2,808) — 739\nDeveloped technology 11,166 (10,590) — 576 11,224 (10,440) — 784\nTrade names 1,015 (426) — 589 1,075 (273) — 802\nPatented technology 80 (80) — — 80 (80) — —\n35,557 (25,817) — 9,740 36,317 (24,539) — 11,778\nIndefinite-lived trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 8,400 N/A — 8,400\nTotal intangible assets $ 43,957 $ (25,817) $ — $ 18,140 $ 44,717 $ (24,539) $ — $ 20,178\n(In thousands)\nSoftware development costs $ 67,541 $ (45,535) $ (22,006) $ — $ 67,541 $ (45,535) $ (22,006) $ —\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, goodwill increased $0.8 million due to business combination activity and decreased $0.9\nmillion due to foreign currency translation.

During the year ended March 31, 2022, finite-lived intangible assets\nincreased $12.2 million due to business combination activity and $0.4 million due to amortization expense.\nSee Note 15, Business Combination, for more information on business combination activity.\nEstimated future amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\n(In thousands) Estimated Amortization Expense\nFiscal year ending March 31,\n2024 $ 1,208\n2025 913\n2026 913\n2027 835\n2028 602\nThereafter 5,269\nTotal $ 9,740\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 are tested for\nimpairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount\nis greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding\nthe carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n49\n6. Leases\nThe majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of\noffice equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases.\nDuring April 2023, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately $1.4 million that will commence in fiscal year 2024 with a\nlease term of approximately 3.5 years. We do not have any related party leases. We have variable payments for expenses such as\ncommon area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not\ninclude variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe sublease one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that will expire during fiscal year 2024.\nThe components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as\nfollows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating leases expense $ 5,301 $ 4,752\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of ROU assets 3 17\nInterest on lease liabilities 1 2\nTotal finance lease expense 4 19\nVariable lease costs 700 463\nShort term lease expense 300 140\nSublease income (789) (782)\nTotal lease expense $ 5,516 $ 4,592\nOther information related to leases for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\nSupplemental cash flow information 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n(in thousands):\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,862 $ 5,536\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 6 23\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 4 19\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands):\nOperating leases $ 8,292 $ 1,314\nWeighted average remaining lease terms\nOperating leases 7.59 3.08\nFinance leases 0.58 1.43\nWeighted average discount rates\nOperating leases 6.44% 7.62%\nFinance leases 4.50% 4.50%\n50\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-\ncancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nMarch 31, 2023:\n(In thousands) Operating leases (1) Finance leases\nFiscal year ending March 31,\n2024 $ 3,408 $ 2\n2025 2,905\n2026 2,726\n2027 2,219\n2028 1,431\nThereafter 8,816\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 21,505 2\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease\nliabilities (4,765) —\nTotal lease liabilities $ 16,740 $ 2\n(1) Non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 of $0.7 million is not included in the table\nabove.\n7.

The fiscal 2022 tax provision differs from the statutory rate\nprimarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset\nby current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued liabilities $ 8,748 $ 7,574\nAllowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 132 83\nFederal losses and credit carryforwards 36,912 50,612\nForeign losses and credit carryforwards 3,555 2,793\nState losses and credit carryforwards 10,080 11,179\nDeferred revenue 291 193\nCapitalized research expenses 11,399 —\nProperty and equipment and software amortization 325 416\nOperating lease liabilities 4,171 1,489\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (536) 607\nOther 185 163\n75,262 75,109\nLess: valuation allowance (67,928) (69,515)\nTotal 7,334 5,594\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (3,153) (1,269)\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (3,659) (2,575)\nOther 12 (15)\nTotal (6,800) (3,859)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net $ 534 $ 1,735\nAt March 31, 2023, we had $132.0 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to\n2039, and $43.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Canada,\nSingapore and Australia subsidiaries have $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million of net operating loss\ncarryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia can be carried forward indefinitely. Canada losses\ncan be carried back three years and carried forward 20 years. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”.\nOne of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5\nyears of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50% of regular India\nincome taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the\nbenefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $2.7 million as of March 31, 2023. The Company has paid minimum alternative\ntaxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of $1.8 million as of March 31, 2023.\nAt March 31, 2023 we also had $133.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2042.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made a significant change to Internal Revenue Code Section 174, which went into effect\nfor taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. The change requires Companies to capitalize specific research and experimental\n(“R&E”) expenditures and amortize over five years for U.S. incurred R&E or fifteen years for foreign incurred R&E beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2022. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our deferred tax assets but does not impact our cash tax\nliabilities in the current period.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of\nthe ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2023, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax\nassets of $67.9 million was comprised of $66.2 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $1.7 million associated with\ndeferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets\ndepends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary\ndifferences are deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback\nand carryforward periods), projected earnings, and tax planning strategies in our assessment of positive and negative evidence\nsupporting the likelihood of deferred tax asset realization. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have\n53\nsufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future\nearnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that\na significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the\nrecognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance\nreleases will depend on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded effective\ntax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not impact the amount\nof cash paid for income taxes.\nThe undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are\ndistributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed\nearnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $22.2 million and $17.1 million as of March 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we\nwill invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion.\nThe determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not\npracticable.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had a liability of $0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would impact our\neffective income tax rate. There have been no changes to our uncertain tax positions during the three years ended March 31, 2023.\nWe recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a\ncomponent of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years\nended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million,\nrespectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of\ntax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in\nunrecognized tax benefits is more likely than not to occur during the next 12 months.\nIn the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five\nyears. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open\nfrom 2011 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2018 forward in certain state\njurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to\nseven years. Years beginning after 2016 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities.\n10. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow\neligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100% of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax\ncontributions and 50% of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each\nyear for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $1.7 million, $1.4 million, and\n$0.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nWe also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in\naccordance with local statutory requirements and business practices.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance\nwith local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at\nretirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the\ntenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated\n54\nBalance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities” and \"Salaries, wages, and related benefits\"\nwithin \"Accrued liabilities\".\nEndorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance\nAgilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements.\nWe entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified\namount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary.\nOur investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair\nvalue at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the cash surrender value of $1.0\nmillion for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those\nexecutives' designated beneficiaries of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within \"Other non-current\nliabilities.\"\nChanges in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within\n“Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a loss of $18,000 in fiscal\n2023 and a gain of $13,000 and $31,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging\nthat certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g.,\nrestaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was\nconsolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the\ncase were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the\none surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was\naffirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were\nnot asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In\nDecember 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth\nappealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with\nits prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us.\nAt this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary\nexposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in\nthis matter.\n55\n12. Earnings per Share\nThe following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average\nnumber of shares of dilutive potential common shares.\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 14,582 $ 6,478 $ (21,001)\nSeries A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — — (1,031)\nSeries A convertible preferred stock dividends (1,836) (1,836) (1,576)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 12,746 $ 4,642 $ (23,608)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,694 24,357 23,458\nDilutive SSARs 1,059 1,063 —\nDilutive RSUs — — —\nDilutive unvested restricted shares 176 63 —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,929 25,483 23,458\nIncome (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.52 $ 0.19 $ (1.01)\nIncome (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.49 $ 0.18 $ (1.01)\nAnti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares and preferred shares 1,741 1,736 4,228\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic\nshares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 407,324, 147,973 and\n132,198 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as these shares were issued but\nwere not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet\ndates.\nDiluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled\nappreciation rights (SSARs), restricted stock units, and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is\nreported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards\nbecause doing so would be anti-dilutive.\n13. Share-based Compensation\nWe may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance\nshares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864\ncommon shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the\neffective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash,\ncanceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020\nPlan is 3.1 million.\nWe may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted\nshares, restricted stock units or performance shares.\nFor SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The\nmaximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes\nthe period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition.\nRestricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price\nthat may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-\nbased grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and\n56\ncontingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that\napply to the underlying grants.\nWe record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to certain\nemployees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit\nand restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For\nstock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-\nMerton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the\nrisk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the\nsimplified method. We used the simplified method for SSAR grants during the year ended March 31, 2021 because we believed\nhistorical exercise data did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For restricted stock unit,\nrestricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option\npricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold,\nperformance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on\nhistorical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and\nsuboptimal exercise factor.\nWe record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the\ngraded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service\nperiod, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on\nthe closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense\nover the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of\nDirectors.\nThe following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProduct development 7,987 8,186 21,634\nSales and marketing 1,044 1,355 4,254\nGeneral and administrative 3,927 5,008 14,206\nTotal share-based compensation expense 12,958 14,549 40,093\nStock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights\nSSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date\nof exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc.\nWe use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs. There were no service\ncondition SSARs granted in fiscal 2023 or 2022. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing service\ncondition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021:\n2021\nRisk-free interest rate 0.31%\nExpected life (in years) 4\nExpected volatility 42.99%\nWeighted-average grant date fair value $ 22.57\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected\nlife of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be\noutstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded\nvesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date.\nWe use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. There were no market condition SSARs\ngranted in fiscal 2023 or 2022. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair\nvalue of market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021:\n57\n2021\nRisk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.60%\nExpected volatility 40.00%\nSuboptimal exercise factor 2.50x\nWeighted-average grant date fair value $ 19.55\nThe following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2023 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans:\nWeighted-\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nNumber Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\n(In thousands, except share and per share data) of Rights Price Term Value\n(per right) (in years)\nOutstanding at April 1, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02\nGranted — —\nExercised (573,016) 18.70\nForfeited (27,463) 20.02\nCancelled/expired — —\nOutstanding at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804\nExercisable at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804\nVested and expected to vest at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804\nThe following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCompensation expense $ 3,188 $ 10,030 $ 35,808\nTotal intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 28,025 $ 34,437 $ 25,153\nTotal fair value of SSARs vesting $ 13,037 $ 6,439 $ 31,380\nAs of March 31, 2023, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to SSARs.\nA total of 403,079 shares, net of 127,747 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued\nfrom treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. The shares withheld were returned to\ntreasury shares.\nRestricted Shares\nWe use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition. There were no\nrestricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2023 or 2021.

We do not include restricted shares in\nthe calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested.\nRestricted Stock Units\nWe granted restricted stock units to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted stock units\nare also subject to a market condition.

Once attainment of the\nperformance conditions becomes probable, we recognize compensation expense related to performance shares ratably over the\nperformance period. The number of performance shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant\ndate and settlement date, which are the same under the 2020 plan.\nBased on the performance conditions achieved as they relate to our annual bonus plan, management estimates a liability of $0.4\nmillion as of March 31, 2023, to be settled through the granting and vesting of performance shares after March 31, 2023. We\nrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares of $0.4 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 and $0.2\nmillion in each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n14. Preferred Stock\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund\nI, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the\nInvestment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $35\nmillion. We incurred issuance costs of $1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance\nof the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One\nLLC.\nAccounting Policy\nWe classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption\nclauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value\n(described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Designation included as\nExhibit 3.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 9, 2022, which superseded the Certificate of Amendment included as\nExhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, when we converted to a Delaware corporation in February\n2022, defines all terms not otherwise defined below):\nVoting\nThe Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common\nshareholders of the Company, and except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or required by\nlaw, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the\nConvertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a\nseparate class.\nLiquidation Preference\nUpon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an\namount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the\n60\n“Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible\nPreferred Stock were converted into common stock.\nRedemption\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was initially issued, the Company will have the right,\nand the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less\nthan all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference.\nConversion\nEach Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-\nassessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as\ndescribed in the Certificate of Designation).\nSubject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible\nPreferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023, the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s\ncommon stock is at least 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately\npreceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert.\nDividends\nThe Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25% per annum, payable semi-annually either (i)\n50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the\nCompany. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis;\nhowever, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on\nliquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible\nPreferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the\namount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into\ncommon stock.\nChange in Control Events\nUpon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case,\nat the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible\nPreferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring\nprior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation\nPreference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the\nConvertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control\noccurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued.\nStandstill Restrictions\nThe Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions,\nacquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25%\nof the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred\nStock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and\nConvertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10% of the outstanding common stock.\n61\n15. Business Combination\nOn January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a\nCanada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition\nextends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market.\nThe purchase price consisted of $22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $0.3 million of\nResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, $2.2 million of cash paid in March 2022 for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities, and $0.4\nmillion in cash received in January 2023 upon release of escrow funds resulting in net cash consideration of $24.1 million. We\nallocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based\non their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We\ndetermined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts\nthe expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to\nrecord certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered\nperformance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the\npurchase price, we recorded $2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying\nperformance obligations are delivered.\nThe following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite:\n(In thousands) Total\nComponents of Purchase Price:\nCash $ 24,405\nTotal purchase price $ 24,405\nAllocation of Purchase Price:\nNet tangible assets (liabilities):\nAccounts receivable, net $ 2,025\nOther current assets, including cash acquired 519\nOther assets 567\nCurrent and other liabilities (768)\nContract liabilities (2,835)\nDeferred income taxes, non-current (1,204)\nNet tangible assets (liabilities) (1,696)\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 9,634\nNon-competition agreements 848\nDeveloped technology 827\nTrade names 846\nTotal identifiable intangible assets 12,155\nGoodwill 13,946\nTotal purchase price allocation $ 24,405\nWe assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated\nuseful lives of 15 years, two years, five years, and five years, respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years.\nThe acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in\nwhich the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives.\nThe goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve\na broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. During the year ended March 31, 2023, we increased\ngoodwill by $0.8 million to record deferred income tax liabilities identified during the measurement period related to Canada tax\ntreatment of certain intangible assets and to record final working capital adjustments related to the purchase price. The acquisition\nresulted in the recognition of $13.9 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company recognized acquisition costs of $0.2 million and $0.5 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting\nprimarily of professional fees, during the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The consolidated statement of operations\nincludes these costs in other charges.\n62\nRevenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations was $5.2 million and $1.3 million for the\nyear ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The pro forma impact of the business combination during the two years ended\nMarch 31, 2022 was not material to our historical consolidated operating results and is therefore not presented.\nEffective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc.\n16.

Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate\nController and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO, and PAO concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO,\nCFO, and PAO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute\nassurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO, CFO, and PAO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\nsupervision of our CEO, CFO, and PAO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of March 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on the evaluation, management concluded\nthat Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023.\nGrant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of March 31, 2023, which is included elsewhere in this annual report.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our CEO, CFO, and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-\nmaking can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by\nindividual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls\nalso is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will\nsucceed in achieving its stated goals under all possible conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nItem 9C.

Business.\nOverview\nAgilysys has been driving hospitality software innovations for more than 40 years, delivering cloud-native SaaS and on-premise ready\nguest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise lines, corporate foodservice management, restaurants,\nuniversities, stadiums and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the hospitality industry, including\npoint-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the\nentire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service and recent investments in research and\ndevelopment, having modernized virtually all its longstanding trusted software solutions. Some of the largest hospitality companies\naround the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies.\nAgilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta,\nGA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2022\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.\nHistory and Significant Events\nOrganized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic\ncomponents and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial\nElectronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring\nbusinesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we\nchanged our name to Agilysys, Inc.\nIn fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology\nsolutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.\nIn fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to\nshareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis,\nInc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the\nhospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of\napplications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust\nsolutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations.\nIn fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth\nopportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating\ncorporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining\noperating units.\nIn fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital\nGroup, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth\nopportunities in the hospitality market.\nIn fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.\nWe converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022.\nToday, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to\npromote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase\nefficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate\n4\nwith other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective\nmanagement, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.\nOur strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and\nmaintenance agreements, and professional services.\nProducts, Support and Professional Services\nWe are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software\nsolutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and\nprofessional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the\necosystem of these core solutions.\nWe present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories:\n• Products (hardware and software)\n• Support, maintenance and subscription services\n• Professional services\nTotal revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nProducts $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 44,230\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 98,958 88,565 83,680\nProfessional services 27,722 21,897 32,847\nTotal $ 162,636 $ 137,176 $ 160,757\nProducts: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems.\nSoftware sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’\nability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by\nthe ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third\nparty solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as\nstaff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven\nby new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases.\nSupport, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription\nservices are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue.\nGrowth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative\nnew products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has\nenabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and\nmaximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.\nProfessional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions\ninto both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and\nfast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive\nexperience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve\nmaximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.\nOur portfolio of hospitality software solutions:\nThe hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the\nindustry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To\nresolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be\nfocused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications\nnecessary to support this ecosystem.\n5\nOur technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality\noperators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that\nhelps our customers improve the guest experience, optimize staff efficiency, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs,\nwhich leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and\nretain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the\nentire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.\nWith our omni-channel suite of software products, we are uniquely positioned to offer solutions that allow customers to adhere to\nsocial distancing guidelines, offer contactless solutions at every point of the guest journey, and maximize operational efficiency all\nwhile providing an improved guest experience.\nPoint of Sale (POS) Solutions:\nAgilysys POS solution suite allows customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property.

Our products have been enabling\nmission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the\nhospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency,\nenhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for\nour customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following\nhospitality verticals: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare.\nWe operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA.\nSome verticals we serve continue to face uncertainties with the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people receive vaccinations and\npandemic-related restrictions continue to ease, the markets we serve are recovering and re-opening to their customers. The long-term\noutlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the three years preceding the pandemic to continue building with a\ngrowing focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be\napproximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an\neconomic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about\nour opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry.\nCustomers\nOur customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or\ndepartments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of\ncustomer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly\nfragmented.\nHuman Capital\nAs of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 1,400 employees, with approximately 63%, 30%, 3%, 3%, and 1% of our\nemployees located in India, the United States, APAC, Canada, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our\nemployees to be good and a critical factor in our success.\nOur senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a\npassion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive\ncompensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our\nemployees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local\nmarkets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success.\nWe are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We\nmake all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without\nregard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship,\npregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws.

We believe that each of our employees' individual character, virtues, and individual\nexperiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers.\nSeasonality\nOccasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large\ncustomer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.\nCompetition\nOur solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with\ncustomers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service.\nWe compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software,\nsupport, subscription and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji,\n12\nAmadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS\nsystems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such\ncompliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.\nAccess to Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports\nare available free of charge through our corporate website, http://www.agilysys.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such\nmaterial is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information posted on our\nwebsite is not incorporated into this Annual Report. Reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding\nissuers that file electronically, are maintained on the SEC website, http://www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMarkets, Competition, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions.\nBecause we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including\nin areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the 2022 Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any\ngeneral weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending\ncould cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could\ncause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay\npayment for previously purchased products and services.\nFor example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases\nin energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions\nin air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed below under “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our\nbusiness and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,” our performance has\nbeen affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these\nconditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after\nCOVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of\nadverse changes in travel and leisure activities.\nSimilarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which\nmay adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an\nunknown period of time.\nThe global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the\nglobal economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to\ncontrol its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations\nsuch as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as\nthese restrictions have been relaxed in many parts of the world, including across the United States, they remain effective in other parts\nof the world and have frequently been re-imposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a\nresult, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate\nfoodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadiums and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity\nacross these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers’ businesses. Business\nclosures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue.\nWe saw an improvement in the overall business environment and the hospitality market we serve during the second half of our fiscal\n2021 (the year ended March 31, 2021) that continued through our fiscal 2022 as our customers re-opened their locations for business\nand our suppliers resumed operations that had been closed or reduced due to the pandemic. Based on the improved business\n13\nenvironment and our financial performance, we have resumed certain levels of spending; however, we will continue to assess\nspending activity as the facts and circumstances surrounding the pandemic evolve. Any resulting cost controls may have an adverse\nimpact on our business, particularly if they remain in place for an extended period. As the pandemic has evolved, we have also\nadapted our pandemic response based on the conditions of the locations in which we and our customers and suppliers operate. We\nexpect to incur additional costs to the extent we further resume business-related travel and our employees return to our office\nlocations, the timing and extent of which remains undetermined at this time. We expect the office activity will vary significantly from\nregion to region based on factors such as the availability of vaccines and the spread and overall impact of any new virus variants.\nNotwithstanding the recovery in the business environment since the early part of the pandemic, given the uncertainty associated with\nthe pandemic, our ability to predict how it will impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results in future\nperiods is limited.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the\nsupply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with\ninternational supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international\ntrade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs,\nincluding on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply\ncosts, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market\nacceptance.\nOur business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order\nto remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the\ninvestment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are\notherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new\nproducts or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at\nall, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and\nresources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n• Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n• Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers;\nand\n• Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware\nproducts, such as mobile devices.\nOur product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of\ntime, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related\nproduct opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will,\nif ever, receive significant revenues from these investments.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not\ntechnologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price\nreductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nSeveral companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes\nit likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our\ncompetitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems\nintegration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete\neffectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to\nreduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or\n14\nservices, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price\nmodifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to\ncontend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could\nadversely affect our revenues and liquidity.\nOur future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our\nbusiness and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-\nterm strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions.\nInvestments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are\ncritical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of\nresources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and development\nmay result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate.\nHowever, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in\nnew areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term.\nTo be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among\nopportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new\nareas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with\nthe new solutions, in which we have invested.\nOur success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure,\nsystems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new\nimplementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems\nduring or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and\ninfrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs.\nWe do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services\nneeds from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner\nprograms, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it\nmay have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.\nFor certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create\nsignificant risk exposure for us.\nWe maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other\ncloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these\nproviders with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If\nthese third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other\ndifficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs,\npotential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate\nthese services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it\ncould result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially\nadversely impact our business.\nWe also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our\ncompetitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be\nsmaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in\nan effort to benefit our margins.\nIf any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any\nother disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a\n15\ncompetitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of\nUkraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the\napplicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any\nof which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish\ncontractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in\nobtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to\nstand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our\nrelationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business\nmay be impaired and our financial results may suffer.\nWe depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we\nmust retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry\nchallenge given the competitive technology labor market, especially with the remote work options brought on by the COVID-19\npandemic. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities and challenges.\nThe market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in technology\nareas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other\nemerging companies in trending market sectors. Remote employment arrangements also come with challenges, including with respect\nto collaboration, training, and corporate culture, especially at a significant scale. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel when and where they are needed or to manage effectively our remote workforce, our ability to operate and grow our\nbusiness could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our\nprofitability may be adversely affected.\nWhile the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even\ntighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or\nincreasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs\noutpace our revenue growth.\nOur international operations have many associated risks.\nWe continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention\nand financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance\nthat we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and\nchallenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial\ncondition.\nWe have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India.\nWe have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support\nchannels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and\ndifficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing\nintegrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and\ncollecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in\nsome countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic\ninstability abroad.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research\nand development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our\nadministrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is\nconcentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for\nmonths at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of\nterrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’\nability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to\ncustomers.\n16\nRegulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality\nCyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nWe have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data\nagainst cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon\nwhom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported\nactors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in\nour systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in\nthe design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems,\nand those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses,\ncredential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized\naccess to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.\nThe number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including\nsophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks,\nanticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain\nundetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained\ntherein, our customers and ultimately, our business.\nThese events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally\nidentifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our\nability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with\napplicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as\ntheir and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable\ninformation is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security\nsuch as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what\nconstitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by\njurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their\napplicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to\ncomply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or\npotential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions,\ncomplaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities.\nOur software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be\npossible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the\ncustomer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry\nsecurity requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and\nimplementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our\nsoftware can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software,\nour business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to\nprotect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary\ntechnology.\n17\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual\nproperty or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by\nother parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase\nand overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the\nattention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the\nconduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we\nreceive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe\npatents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on\nelectronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for\nus and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement.\nIf we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal\nliability.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high\nquality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be\ndamaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions,\nbreaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions\nor breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses.\nIn addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include\nprovisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately\nprotect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for\nerrors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be\navailable on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not\ndisclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available\ninsurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.\nRisks Relating to the Industries We Serve\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of\nthat industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality\nindustry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as\ncustomers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding\nthe potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our\nbusiness, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information.\nConsolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other\ncompanies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry.\nAlthough recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance\nthat future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a\ncompany that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services\nfrom us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nInsolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19\npandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their\n18\nlenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have\nsufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of\ncustomers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nIf we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.\nAs part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek\nacquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such\nacquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen\ndifficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired\nbusinesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from\nour customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies\nare included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these\ncontingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially\nimpact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $32.8 million and $20.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March\n31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain\nsolutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment\ncharges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and\ncash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued\ncosts to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to\nzero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required\nto write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our\nproducts. Our lack of consistent profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product\nupgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations.\nOur stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2022,\nthe trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $58.45 to a low close of $35.31. The market price for our common\nstock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n• uncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy;\n• economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;\n• our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of\nsecurities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial\nrelationships or capital commitments;\n• our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; and\n• any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates,\nfuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\n19\nOn May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a\nconversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the\nprice of our common stock.\nAdditionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the\nvolatility of our common share price over time.\nWe may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.\nWhile we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront\ncredit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess\nof federally insured amounts, if any.\nOther Risk Factors\nWe are subject to litigation, which may be costly.\nAs a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such\nlitigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take\nsteps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact\non our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business.\nWhile we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the\nobjectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In\naddition, we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 30,000 square feet of office space in\nBellevue, Washington, of which we sublease 22,000 square feet to a third party, 5,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 101,000 square feet\nof office space in Chennai, India, 7,000 square feet in Toronto, Canada, and lease several other smaller office locations throughout\nEurope and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe that our current facilities and\noffice space are sufficient to meet our needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging\nthat certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g.,\nrestaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was\nconsolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the\ncase were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the\none surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was\naffirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were\nnot asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In\nDecember 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth\n20\nappealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although on May 11, 2022,\njudgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the\njudgement.\nAt this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary\nexposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in\nthis matter.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n21\nPart II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. As of May 13,\n2022, there were 1,343 registered holders of our common shares, without par value.\nDividends\nWe did not pay dividends in fiscal 2022 or 2021 on our common stock and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. We pay\npreferred stock dividends as described in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report. The current practice of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations and growth\nof our business, both organically and through acquisitions.\nShareholder Return Performance Presentation\nThe following chart compares the value of $100 invested in our common shares, including reinvestment of dividends, with a similar\ninvestment in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) and with the companies listed in the SIC Code 7373-Computer Integrated\nSystems Design for the period March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2022.

[Reserved]\n23\nItem 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the\ngeneral financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including:\n— what factors affect our business;\n— what our earnings and costs were;\n— why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;\n— where the earnings came from;\n— how our financial condition was affected; and\n— where the cash will come from to fund future operations.\nThe MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nInformation provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could\ncause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking\nInformation” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information\nconcerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about\ninvesting in Agilysys.\nOverview\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our\nbusiness during the year ended March 31, 2022. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and\nresults of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers,\npartners, and suppliers and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on\na subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time.\nWhile we have previously taken certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations in\nresponse to changes in the global environment. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the\noperational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be\npredicted at this time.\nOur Business\nAgilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise\nguest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities,\nstadiums and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS),\nproperty management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey.\nAgilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service. During recent years, Agilysys has made major investments in\nR&D and has successfully modernized virtually all its longstanding trusted software solutions. Some of the largest hospitality\ncompanies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational\nefficiencies.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America,\nEurope, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia.\nOur top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business\nthrough superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to\nexisting software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and\ngeographically.\nOur strategic plan specifically focuses on:\n24\n• Putting the customer first\n• Focusing on product innovation and development\n• Improving our liquidity\n• Increasing organizational efficiency and teamwork\n• Developing our employees and leaders\n• Growing revenue by improving the breadth and depth of our product set across both point-of-sale and property management\napplications\n• Growing revenue through international expansion\nThe primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities,\nincreasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve.\nProfitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus\nof our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns.\nRevenue – Defined\nAs required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services\nrevenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may,\nat times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our\nrevenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to\nthose of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue:\n• Revenue – We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances.\n• P roducts revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems.\n• Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed\no ngoing support, maintenance and subscription services.\n• Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for\nproprietary and remarketed products.\n25\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021\nNet Revenue and Operating Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended March 31, Increase (decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ %\nNet revenue:\nProducts $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 9,242 34.6 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 98,958 88,565 10,393 11.7 %\nProfessional services 27,722 21,897 5,825 26.6 %\nTotal net revenue 162,636 137,176 25,460 18.6 %\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts 19,251 13,506 5,745 42.5 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 21,141 17,985 3,156 17.5 %\nProfessional services 20,712 16,309 4,403 27.0 %\nTotal cost of goods sold 61,104 47,800 13,304 27.8 %\nGross profit $ 101,532 $ 89,376 $ 12,156 13.6 %\nGross profit margin 62.4 % 65.2 %\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development $ 46,332 $ 55,345 $ (9,013 ) (16.3 )%\nSales and marketing 14,730 14,196 534 3.8 %\nGeneral and administrative 27,734 33,273 (5,539 ) (16.6 )%\nDepreciation of fixed assets 2,210 2,832 (622 ) (22.0 )%\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,654 1,959 (305 ) (15.6 )%\nSeverance and other charges 1,584 2,529 (945 ) (37.4 )%\nLegal settlements 969 200 769 nm\nOperating income (loss) $ 6,319 $ (20,958 ) $ 27,277 nm\nOperating income (loss) percentage 3.9 % (15.3 )%\nnm - not meaningful\n26\nThe following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated\nnet revenues for the periods presented:\nYear ended March 31,\n2022 2021\nNet revenue:\nProducts 22.1 % 19.5 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 60.8 64.6\nProfessional services 17.1 15.9\nTotal net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts 11.8 % 9.8 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 13.0 13.1\nProfessional services 12.8 11.9\nTotal net cost of goods sold 37.6 % 34.8 %\nGross profit 62.4 % 65.2 %\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development 28.4 % 40.4 %\nSales and marketing 9.1 10.3\nGeneral and administrative 17.1 24.4\nDepreciation of fixed assets 1.4 2.1\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.0 1.4\nSeverance and other charges 1.0 1.8\nLegal settlements 0.5 0.1\nOperating income (loss) 3.9 % (15.3 )%\nNet revenue. Total revenue increased $25.5 million, or 18.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $9.2\nmillion, or 34.6%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and\nsubscription services revenue increased $10.4 million, or 11.7%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which\nincreased 28.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Professional services revenue increased $5.8 million, or 26.6%, due to higher\nsales and service activity as our customers shift their focus to implementing technology to improve their operations.\nGross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 13.6%, in fiscal 2022 and total gross profit\nmargin decreased from 65.2% to 62.4%. Products gross profit increased $3.5 million and gross profit margin decreased from 49.4% to\n46.5% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software revenue. Support, maintenance and subscription\nservices gross profit increased $7.2 million and gross profit margin decreased from 79.7% to 78.6% as certain variable costs increased\nahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.4 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from\n25.5% to 25.3% due to continued hiring and training of new staff to meet increasing project backlogs from ongoing sales activity and\ncertain project delays.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $14.9 million, or 13.9%, in\nfiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 21.5% in fiscal 2022\ncompared with fiscal 2021.\nProduct development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development\ndecreased $9.0 million, or 16.3%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $4.4 million in payroll and other\noperating expenses as we continue to manage market compensation pressures offset by a decrease in share-based compensation\nexpense of $13.4 million due to significant charges resulting from accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs)\nupon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021.\n27\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.5 million, or 3.8%, in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 due to an increase\nof $3.4 million in payroll, travel, advertising, promotion and other operating expenses as we invest in our sales and marketing teams\nand return to travel for in-person selling and increased marketing event and trade show activity offset by a decrease in share-based\ncompensation expense of $2.9 million due to significant charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market\ncondition satisfaction in February 2021.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative decreased $5.5 million, or 16.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due\nto an increase of $3.7 million in payroll and other expenses after restoring base pay, employee benefits and various operational\nactivities offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million due to significant charges resulting from the\naccelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021.\nDepreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.6 million or 22.0% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021\ndue to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives.\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.3 million or\n15.6% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal\n2020.\nSeverance and other charges. Severance and other charges decreased $0.9 million due to a significant reduction in employee\nterminations during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nLegal settlements. Legal settlements increased $0.8 million during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase in\nsettlements of employment and other business-related matters.\nOther (Income) Expenses\nYear ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ %\nOther (income) expense:\nInterest (income) $ (59 ) $ (107 ) $ (48 ) 44.9 %\nInterest expense 12 20 8 40.0 %\nOther (income) expense, net (145 ) 338 483 nm\nTotal other (income) expense, net $ (192 ) $ 251 $ 443 nm\nnm – not meaningful\nInterest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper,\ntreasury bills and money market funds.\nInterest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian\ncurrencies against the US dollar.\nIncome Taxes\nYear ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ %\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 33 $ (208 ) $ (241 ) nm\nEffective tax rate 0.5 % 1.0 %\nnm – not meaningful\nFor fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including\nincreases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign\njurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions.\n28\nAlthough the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an\nimmaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are\nconsistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that\nwe will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences and have recorded a valuation allowance substantially offsetting our\ndeferred tax assets. At March 31, 2022, we had $196.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in\nfiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $42.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We\nalso had $166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023 through 2041.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet Revenue and Operating Loss\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:\nYear ended March 31, Increase (decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ %\nNet revenue:\nProducts $ 26,714 $ 44,230 $ (17,516 ) (39.6 )%\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 88,565 83,680 4,885 5.8 %\nProfessional services 21,897 32,847 (10,950 ) (33.3 )%\nTotal net revenue 137,176 160,757 (23,581 ) (14.7 )%\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts, inclusive of developed technology amortization 13,506 36,427 (22,921 ) (62.9 )%\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 17,985 19,248 (1,263 ) (6.6 )%\nProfessional services 16,309 24,130 (7,821 ) (32.4 )%\nTotal cost of goods sold 47,800 79,805 (32,005 ) (40.1 )%\nGross profit $ 89,376 $ 80,952 $ 8,424 10.4 %\nGross profit margin 65.2% 50.4 %\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development $ 55,345 $ 41,463 $ 13,882 33.5 %\nSales and marketing 14,196 19,864 (5,668 ) (28.5 )%\nGeneral and administrative 33,273 24,374 8,899 36.5 %\nDepreciation of fixed assets 2,832 2,574 258 10.0 %\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,959 2,541 (582 ) (22.9 )%\nImpairments — 23,740 (23,740 ) (100.0 )%\nSeverance and other charges 2,529 582 1,947 334.5 %\nLegal settlements 200 (125 ) 325 (260.0 )%\nOperating loss $ (20,958) $ (34,061 ) $ 13,103 (38.5 )%\nOperating loss percentage (15.3) % (21.2 )%\n29\nThe following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated\nnet revenues for the periods presented:\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nNet revenue:\nProducts 19.5 % 27.5 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 64.6 52.1\nProfessional services 15.9 20.4\nTotal net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold:\nProducts, inclusive of developed technology amortization 9.8 % 22.6 %\nSupport, maintenance and subscription services 13.1 12.0\nProfessional services 11.9 15.0\nTotal cost of goods sold 34.8 % 49.6 %\nGross profit 65.2 % 50.4 %\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development 40.4 % 25.8 %\nSales and marketing 10.3 12.4\nGeneral and administrative 24.4 15.2\nDepreciation of fixed assets 2.1 1.6\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.4 1.6\nSeverance and other charges 1.8 0.4\nLegal settlements 0.1 (0.1 )\nOperating loss (15.3 )% (21.2 )%\nNet revenue. Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased\n$17.5 million, or 39.6%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19\npandemic remained unclear during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or\n5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 15.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nSubscription revenue sales were led by our add on software modules, including modules enabling social distancing and contactless\ncapabilities. Professional services revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 33.3%, due to delays in implementation services due to\ncustomer property restrictions, property closures and lower sales from delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the\nhospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remained unclear.\nGross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 10.4%, in fiscal 2021 and total gross profit\nmargin increased from 50.4% to 65.2%. Products gross profit increased $5.4 million and gross profit margin increased from 17.6% to\n49.4% driven mostly by the absence of software development cost amortization during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and\nsubscription services gross profit increased $6.1 million and gross profit margin increased 269 basis points to 79.7% due to increased\nsubscription revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $3.1 million and gross profit margin\ndecreased slightly from 26.5% to 25.5% due to the delay in professional service projects and the fixed costs of maintaining a\nminimum required professional services team as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations and accept\nimplementations and installations.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments, severance and other charges, increased $16.8 million, or\n18.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 22.0% in fiscal\n2021 compared with fiscal 2020.\nProduct development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development\nincreased $13.9 million, or 33.5%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to the continued expansion of our R&D teams\nand significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs)\nupon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021.\n30\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $5.7 million, or 28.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 due to reduced\ncommission expense as a result of lower sales levels, significantly reduced travel, layoffs, temporary reductions in employee benefits,\nand the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity. The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in stock-based\ncompensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative increased $9.0 million, or 37.0%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The\nchange is due primarily to significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs.\nDepreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.3 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020\ndue to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives.\nAmortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.6 million or\n22.9% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal\n2020.\nImpairments. There were no impairments in fiscal 2021. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. The impairments resulted\nfrom specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\non the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions that made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the\nimpacted solutions at the time of impairment determination. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and\ncontinued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We recorded impairment charges to reduce the net\nrealizable value of the related assets to zero during the 2020 fiscal year.\nSeverance and other charges. Severance and other charges increased $1.9 million due to an increase in non-restructuring severance\nactivity during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nLegal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.\nOther (Income) Expenses\nYear ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ %\nOther (income) expense:\nInterest (income) $ (107 ) (380 ) $ (273 ) (71.8 )%\nInterest expense 20 9 $ (11 ) nm\nOther expense, net 338 176 (162 ) (92.0 )%\nTotal other expense (income), net $ 251 $ (195 ) $ (446 ) nm\nnm – not meaningful\nInterest income.

Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that\nwe will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2021, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $46.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that\ncan be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $165.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in\nfiscal years 2022 through 2041.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and\noperating expenses including payments of lease obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office\nspace and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases, and preferred stock dividends in Note 14,\nPreferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAt March 31, 2022, all $97.0 million of our cash on hand was deposited in bank accounts, of which 93% are located in the United\nStates. We believe there is limited credit risk with respect to our cash balances.\nWe believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $97.0 million as of March 31, 2022, and access to capital markets\nwill provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements.\nCash Flow\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 28,475 $ 28,407 $ 10,575\nInvesting activities (25,679 ) (1,391 ) (3,447 )\nFinancing activities (4,901 ) 25,316 (1,116 )\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (104 ) 195 (130 )\n(Decrease) increase in cash $ (2,209 ) $ 52,527 $ 5,882\nCash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.5 million in fiscal 2022. The\nprovision of cash was due primarily to our net income of $6.5 million adjusted for $17.7 million in non-cash expense including\ndepreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of $4.3 million from the changes in operating assets and\nliabilities.\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $28.4 million in fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to our\noperating loss of $21.0 million adjusted for $44.0 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based\ncompensation and an increase of approximately $5.4 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $10.6 million in fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our\noperating loss of $34.1 million adjusted for $46.2 million in non-cash expense including impairment charges, depreciation,\namortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 were $25.7 million due to $24.5 million in\ncash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and $1.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, including internal\nuse software.\nCash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 were $1.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment,\nincluding internal use software.\n32\nCash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 were $3.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment,\nincluding internal use software.\nCash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 were $4.9 million and\nprimarily comprised of share repurchases of $3.0 million to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8\nmillion in preferred stock dividends.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the $25.3 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance\nproceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $7.5 million for the repurchase of shares to satisfy\nemployee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends.\nCash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 were $1.1 million and primarily comprised of share repurchases to satisfy\nemployee tax withholding on share-based compensation.\nInvestments\nInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies\nAgilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar\nlife insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life\ninsurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in\nthese corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance\nsheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining\npolicies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated\nbeneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets at the balance sheet date.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect\non our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,\nor capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nsignificant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments,\nintangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies\ndiscussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because\ntheir application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on\nestimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in\nthe following paragraphs.\nFor all these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely\nrequire adjustment.\nRevenue recognition. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The\nmajority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms\nand conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different\ngoods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each\nindividual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and\nservices that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the\ncontract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange\n33\nfor transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or\nrefund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or\nrefund.\nTypically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant\nservices of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is\ndelivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have\nconcluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically\nrecognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nRevenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the\nsupplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at\nthe point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nSupport and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and\nunspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready\nobligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and\nmaintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to\naccess the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not\nconsidered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance\nobligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on\nthe typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services\nare being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s\nability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or\nservices in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\nWe use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShare-based compensation. We have an equity incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock\noptions, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted\nshares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but\nunissued shares.\nWe record compensation expense related to stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted\nto certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted\nshare grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option\nand stock-settled appreciation right (SSAR) grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date\nusing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and\nassumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected\n34\nterm as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the\nfair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing\nmarket price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our\ncommon shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price,\nremaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional\ninformation regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based\nCompensation, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional information about recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted and those not yet effective.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services\ninternationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises\nfrom exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue from international operations was 7%, 8% and 9%,\nrespectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of\noperations for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue,\nexpenses, operating profit and net income.\n35\nItem 8.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),\nshareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial\nstatement schedule(s) included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(“COSO”), and our report dated May 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical\naudit matters.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 23, 2022\n37\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nAgilysys, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, and our report dated\nMay 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over\nfinancial reporting of ResortSuite, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues\nconstituting one percent and less than one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for\nthe year ended March 31, 2022. As indicated in Management’s Report, ResortSuite, Inc. was acquired during 2022. Management’s\nassertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial\nreporting of ResortSuite, Inc.\n38\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally\\ accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 23, 2022\n39\nAGILYSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of March 31,\n(In thousands, except share

share data)\n1. Nature of Operations\nAgilysys has been driving hospitality software innovations for more than 40 years, delivering cloud-native SaaS and on-premise ready\nguest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise lines, corporate foodservice management, restaurants,\nuniversities, stadiums and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the hospitality industry, including\npoint-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the\nentire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service and recent investments in research and\ndevelopment, having modernized virtually all its longstanding trusted software solutions. Some of the largest hospitality companies\naround the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies.\nAgilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta,\nGA.\nThe Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.\nReference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within the fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2022\nrefers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe World Health Organization declared novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic has created\nsignificant economic challenges as organizations and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous\nmeasures attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and\nsocial distancing requirements. Our customers and vendors have closed or have otherwise applied restrictions at certain sites in\nresponse to the pandemic. Similarly, we have provided remote working arrangements for our employees, limited business travel, and\ncanceled or shifted various events to virtual attendance. We have localized our pandemic response to the countries and specific\nlocations in which we, our customers and our vendors operate.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments\nin affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been\neliminated.\nUse of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported\nperiods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19.\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of\nthree months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity\ndate are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the following business day\nafter instruction to redeem. Cash equivalent investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of\ndeposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. As of March 31, 2022, commercial paper cash\nequivalents totaled $15 million. We held no commercial paper as of March 31, 2021 or 2020. We determine the fair value of\ncommercial paper using significant other observable inputs (level 2) based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates.\nAllowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the\ninability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical\nexperience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we\nperform periodic credit evaluations of our customers.\n45\nCustomer credit allowance. We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount\nof customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many\ncases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we\ninvoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested\nby the customer within the terms of our contract.\nInventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of\nrelated reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure\nappropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual\nprovisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change\nand/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations\nmay be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of\nhistorical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”)\nassets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-\ncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities\nare included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right\nto use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset\nfor the duration of the lease term.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease\npayments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing\nsince our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease\neconomic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives\nreceived or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income\non a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have\nleases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index\nor rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have\na term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material\nimpact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party\ntransactions associated with our lease agreements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net\nassets of acquired companies. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of goodwill was $32.8 million and $19.6 million,\nrespectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist,\nbased on our one reporting unit. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based\non its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. Based on testing performed, the\nCompany concluded that no impairment of its goodwill has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least\nannually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nAcquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include identifiable customer relationships, non-competition agreements,\ndeveloped technology, and trade names. We amortize the cost of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful\nlives, which are periods of 15 years or less, primarily on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the\nassets are utilized. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are determined\nprimarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows attributable to these assets to present value using\nestimates and assumptions determined by management.\nLong-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor\nreplacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of,\nthe cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under\nfinance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.\n46\nThe estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years;\nfurniture – 7 to 10 years; equipment – 3 to 10 years; software – 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the\neconomic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts\ncapitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s\ncompletion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying\namounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future\nundiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in\nNote 4, Property and Equipment, Net.\nForeign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting\npurposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the\nperiod-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The\ncumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within shareholders’\nequity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional\ncurrency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign\ncurrency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results.\nRevenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (i.e., software, third party hardware and operating systems),\nsupport, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. For the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue from\ninternational operations was 7%, 8% and 9%, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented.\nOur customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts\nare governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any\nindividual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services,\nthe associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract\nare defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be\ntransferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction\nprice is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or\nservices to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain\nthe contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund.\nTypically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations.\nOur software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant\nservices of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is\ndelivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have\nconcluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically\nrecognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer.\nRevenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s\nfinal acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers\nvia drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the\nsupplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay\nfor the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified\nby the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon\nreceipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site.\nSupport and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and\nunspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready\nobligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and\nmaintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement.\nOur subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a\nsubscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription\nperiod under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to\naccess the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not\nconsidered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance\n47\nobligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on\nthe typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services\nare being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s\nability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or\nservices in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are\nperformed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours\nexpended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation.\nWe use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently\nexecuted customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract\ncontains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain\nmultiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP\nbasis.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies.\nComprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is the total of net income (loss), as currently reported under GAAP, plus\nother comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) considers the effects of additional transactions and economic\nevents that are not required to be recorded in determining net income (loss), but rather are reported as a separate statement of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nFair value measurements. We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial\nassets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event\noccurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques.\nInvestments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some\nare endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we\nmust maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated\nbeneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which\napproximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender\nvalue of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed\nto those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current\nliabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10,\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We\nrecognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in\nthe periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that\nsome portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is\nmade on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical\ntaxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the\nimplementation of tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax\npositions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is\nrecognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable\nunder relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9,\nIncome Taxes.\nAdvertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense\nwas $2.6 million, $0.4 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n48\nReclassification. Certain prior year balances have been reclassed to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we\nreclassed certain employee benefit obligations from non-current to current liabilities.\nAdopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With\nCustomers (ASU No. 2021-08), which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 to require acquiring entities to apply\nASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract\nliabilities in a business combination. The ASU is intended to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in\na business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability\nas well as the payment terms and their impact on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The new standard will be effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,\nincluding adoption in an interim period. We adopted ASU 2021-08 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 – see Note 15,\nBusiness Combination.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt—\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity\n(Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting\nfor convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the\nconversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result\nin substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be\nreported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also\nremoves certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted\nearnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement\nbe included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2021 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\nwhich affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for\nincome taxes. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those\nfiscal years. We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of April 1, 2021 with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nManagement continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial\nstatements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting\npronouncements.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nFor in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support,\nmaintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $36.0\nmillion, $26.7 million, and $44.2 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and\nsubscription services and professional services) totaled $126.7 million, $110.5 million, and $116.5 million during fiscal 2022, 2021,\nand 2020.\nContract Balances\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is\nconditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to\nproducts and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We\nreceive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to\n49\nconsideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally\ndue from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract.\nRevenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $38.1 million and $40.9 million\nduring fiscal 2022 and 2021. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $2.4\nmillion and $2.0 million, respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional.\nOur arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2022 are\nexpected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract\nSales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a\ncontract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred\nwhen the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an\nagreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally\nbased on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses\nare immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one\nyear or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected.\nWe had $3.3 million and $2.9 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances\nare included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we expensed $2.5 million\nand $2.8 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $1.2 million and $1.4\nmillion, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred.\n4.

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount\nis greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding\nthe carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAmortization expense related to software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $12.6\nmillion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. These charges are included as Products cost of goods sold within the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\n6. Leases\nThe majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of\noffice equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we have an additional operating lease that has not yet commenced of approximately $11.7 million. This\noperating lease will commence in fiscal year 2023 with a lease term of approximately eleven years. We do not have any related party\nleases. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that\n51\nare based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nWe sublease one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that will expire during fiscal year 2024.\nThe components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as\nfollows:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021\nOperating leases expense $ 4,752 $ 4,440\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of ROU assets 17 26\nInterest on lease liabilities 2 5\nTotal finance lease expense 19 31\nVariable lease costs 463 443\nShort term lease expense 140 120\nSublease income (782 ) (129 )\nTotal lease expense $ 4,592 $ 4,905\nOther information related to leases for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\nSupplemental cash flow information 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n(in thousands):\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,536 $ 5,987\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 23 30\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 19 24\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands):\nOperating leases $ 1,314 $ 1,573\nWeighted average remaining lease terms\nOperating leases 3.08 4.39\nFinance leases 1.43 1.44\nWeighted average discount rates\nOperating leases 7.62 % 10.51 %\nFinance leases 4.50 % 4.46 %\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-\ncancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nMarch 31, 2022:\n(In thousands) Operating leases (1) Finance leases\nFiscal year ending March 31,\n2023 5,222 5\n2024 2,939 2\n2025 1,846 —\n2026 1,319 —\n2027 880 —\nThereafter — —\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 12,206 7\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease\nliabilities (1,508 ) (1 )\nTotal lease liabilities $ 10,698 $ 6\n(1) Non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2023, and 2024 of $0.8 million and $0.7 million,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\n52\n7.

The fiscal 2022 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2022 tax provision\ndiffers from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number\nof foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions.\nThe fiscal 2021 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2021 tax provision differs from the statutory rate\nprimarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset\nby current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued liabilities $ 7,574 $ 9,141\nAllowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 83 279\nFederal losses and credit carryforwards 50,612 51,856\nForeign losses and credit carryforwards 2,793 2,103\nState losses and credit carryforwards 11,179 11,642\nDeferred revenue 193 464\nProperty and equipment and software amortization 416 171\nOperating lease liabilities 1,489 2,694\nGoodwill and other intangible assets 607 1,889\nOther 163 90\n75,109 80,329\nLess: valuation allowance (69,515 ) (74,631 )\nTotal 5,594 5,698\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (1,269 ) (2,312 )\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (2,575 ) (2,514 )\nOther (15 ) 7\nTotal (3,859 ) (4,819 )\nTotal deferred tax assets, net $ 1,735 $ 879\nAt March 31, 2022, we had $196.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to\n2038, and $42.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong,\nMalaysia, Singapore and Australia subsidiaries have $0.4 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million of net operating loss\ncarryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia can be carried forward indefinitely. Our\n54\nIndia subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India\nsubsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal\n2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50% of regular India income taxes during the second five years of operations which\nincludes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $2.6 million as\nof March 31, 2022. The Company has paid minimum alternative taxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of\n$2.0 million as of March 31, 2022.\nAt March 31, 2022 we also had $166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023\nthrough 2041.\nWe recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the\nfuture benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2022, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $69.5 million was\ncomprised of $68.6 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong\nKong, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers\nwhether it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation\nallowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers\nthe scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected\ntaxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to\ngenerate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in\nrecent periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.\nThe amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of\nprofitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods\nfollowing a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes.\nThe undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are\ndistributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed\nearnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $17.1 million and $8.4 million as of March 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will\ninvest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The\ndetermination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not\npracticable.\nWe recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our uncertain tax positions were as follows\nfor the years ended March 31:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at April 1 $ 575 $ 575 $ 580\nReductions relating to lapse in statute — — (5 )\nBalance at March 31 $ 575 $ 575 $ 575\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had a liability of $0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our\neffective income tax rate.\nAlthough the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an\nimmaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are\nconsistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.\nWe recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a\ncomponent of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years\nended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $1.2 million and $1.0 million,\nrespectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five\nyears. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open\nfrom 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2015 forward in certain state\n55\njurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to\nseven years. Years beginning after 2011 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)\nThe CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the\nend of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2022.\n10. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow\neligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100% of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax\ncontributions and 50% of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each\nyear for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $1.4 million, $0.1 million, and\n$1.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in\naccordance with local statutory requirements and business practices.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance\nwith local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at\nretirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the\ntenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities” and \"Salaries, wages, and related benefits\"\nwithin \"Accrued liabilities\".\nEndorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance\nAgilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements.\nWe entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified\namount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary.\nOur investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair\nvalue at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the cash surrender value of $1.0\nmillion for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those\nexecutives' designated beneficiaries of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within \"Other non-current\nliabilities.\"\nChanges in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within\n“Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a gain of $13,000, $31,000\nand $14,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of\nany current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging\nthat certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g.,\nrestaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was\nconsolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the\ncase were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the\n56\none surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was\naffirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were\nnot asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In\nDecember 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth\nappealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with\nits prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us.\nAt this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary\nexposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in\nthis matter.\n12. Earnings per Share\nThe following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average\nnumber of shares of dilutive potential common shares.\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 6,478 $ (21,001 ) $ (34,067)\nSeries A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — (1,031 ) —\nSeries A convertible preferred stock dividends (1,836 ) (1,576 ) —\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 4,642 $ (23,608 ) $ (34,067)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,357 23,458 23,233\nDilutive SSARs 1,063 — —\nDilutive unvested restricted shares 63 — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,483 23,458 23,233\nIncome (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.19 $ (1.01 ) $ (1.47)\nIncome (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.18 $ (1.01 ) $ (1.47)\nAnti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares,\nperformance shares and preferred shares 1,736 4,228 1,510\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic\nshares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 147,973, 132,198 and\n208,581 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as these shares were issued but\nwere not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet\ndates.\nDiluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled\nappreciation rights (\"SSARs\") and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the\ndenominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because\ndoing so would be anti-dilutive.\n13. Share-based Compensation\nWe may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our\nshareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares,\nthe number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the\n2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired.\nThe maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million.\n57\nWe may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and\nperformance share grants.\nFor SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The\nmaximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes\nthe period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition.\nRestricted shares, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their\nfair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be\nconditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted\nshares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying\ngrants.\nWe record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-\nemployee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a\nservice condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only\nto a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs\nincluding the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility\nof our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share\nand SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that\nutilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions\nregarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants\nsubject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor.\nWe record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting\nmethod. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which\nis an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price\nof our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service\nperiod consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nProduct development 8,186 21,634 2,241\nSales and marketing 1,355 4,254 321\nGeneral and administrative 5,008 14,206 2,643\nTotal share-based compensation expense 14,549 40,093 5,205\nStock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights\nSSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date\nof exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc.\nWe use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs. There were no service\ncondition SSARs granted in fiscal 2022. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing service condition\nSSARs granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020:\n2021 2020\nRisk-free interest rate 0.31% 1.38%-1.74%\nExpected life (in years) 4 4.5-5\nExpected volatility 42.99% 31.7%-32.42%\nWeighted-average grant date fair value $ 22.57 $ 10.01\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected\nlife of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be\n58\noutstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded\nvesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date.\nWe use a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. There were no market condition SSARs\ngranted in fiscal 2022.

The shares withheld were returned to\ntreasury shares.\nRestricted Shares\nWe use a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition. There were no\nrestricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2021 or 2020. The following table summarizes the principal valuation\nassumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2022:\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.5% - 0.9%\nExpected volatility 54.0% - 56.0%\nWeighted-average grant date fair value $24.77 - $39.12\n59\nWe granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based.

During fiscal 2022, a total of 147,900 shares were issued from\ntreasury.\nThe following table presents additional information related to restricted share activity during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nCompensation expense $ 4,339 $ 4,105 $ 3,232\nTotal fair value of restricted share vesting $ 3,297 $ 7,554 $ 3,491\nAs of March 31, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted shares was $4.5 million,\nwhich is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.2 years. We do not include restricted shares in the\ncalculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested.\nPerformance Shares\nUpon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with\nour annual bonus plan, we grant common shares to our Chief Executive Officer that vest immediately. Once attainment of the\nperformance conditions becomes probable, we recognize compensation expense related to performance shares ratably over the\nperformance period. The number of performance shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant\ndate and settlement date, which are the same under the 2020 plan.\nBased on the performance conditions achieved as they relate to our annual bonus plan, management estimates a liability of $0.2\nmillion as of March 31, 2022, to be settled through the granting and vesting of performance shares after March 31, 2022. We\nrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares of $0.2 million in each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively.\n14. Preferred Stock\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund\nI, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the\nInvestment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $35\nmillion. We incurred issuance costs of $1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance\nof the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One\nLLC.\nAccounting Policy\n60\nWe classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption\nclauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value\n(described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Designation included as\nExhibit 3.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 9, 2022, which superseded the Certificate of Amendment included as\nExhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, when we converted to a Delaware corporation in February\n2022, defines all terms not otherwise defined below):\nVoting\nThe Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common\nshareholders of the Company, and except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or required by\nlaw, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the\nConvertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a\nseparate class.\nLiquidation Preference\nUpon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an\namount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the\n“Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible\nPreferred Stock were converted into common stock.\nRedemption\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was initially issued, the Company will have the right,\nand the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less\nthan all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference.\nConversion\nEach Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-\nassessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as\ndescribed in the Certificate of Designation).\nSubject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible\nPreferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023, the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s\ncommon stock is at least 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately\npreceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert.\nDividends\nThe Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25% per annum, payable semi-annually either (i)\n50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the\nCompany. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis;\nhowever, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on\nliquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible\nPreferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the\namount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into\ncommon stock.\nChange in Control Events\nUpon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case,\nat the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible\n61\nPreferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring\nprior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation\nPreference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the\nConvertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control\noccurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued.\nStandstill Restrictions\nThe Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions,\nacquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25%\nof the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred\nStock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and\nConvertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10% of the outstanding common stock.\n15. Business Combination\nOn January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a\nCanada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The\nconsolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our\nsolutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market.\nThe purchase price consisted of $22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $0.3 million of\nResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, and $2.2 million of cash paid in March for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities resulting in\nnet cash consideration of $24.5 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets\nacquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated\npurchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by\nusing the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions\ndetermined by management.\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2021-08, we applied Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities\nassumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-\n08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the\nrevenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered.\nThe following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite:\n(In thousands) Total\nComponents of Purchase Price:\nCash $ 24,800\nTotal purchase price $ 24,800\nAllocation of Purchase Price:\nNet tangible assets (liabilities):\nAccounts receivable, net $ 2,025\nOther current assets, including cash acquired 519\nOther assets 567\nCurrent and other liabilities (768 )\nContract liabilities (2,835 )\nNet tangible assets (liabilities) (492 )\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 9,634\nNon-competition agreements 848\nDeveloped technology 827\nTrade names 846\nTotal identifiable intangible assets 12,155\nGoodwill 13,137\nTotal purchase price allocation $ 24,800\n62\nWe assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated\nuseful lives of 15 years, two years, five years, and five years, respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years.\nThe acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in\nwhich the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives.\nThe goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve\na broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $13.1\nmillion of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company recognized acquisition costs of $0.5 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of\nprofessional fees, during the year ended March 31, 2022. The consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in severance\nand other charges.\nRevenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $1.3\nmillion. Net income (loss) was not material. The pro forma impact of the business combination during the two years ended March 31,\n2022 was not material to our historical consolidated operating results and is therefore not presented.\nWe have prepared the purchase price allocation for ResortSuite on a preliminary basis. Changes to the allocation may occur as\nadditional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nEffective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc.\n16.

Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the\nCEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to\nour management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls\nsystem cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\nsupervision of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting as of March 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In performing the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, because we acquired ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”) in a business combination on January 5, 2022\nas described in Part II, Item 8, Note 15, Business Combination, to our consolidated financial statements, our management has\nexcluded the operations of ResortSuite in accordance with the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired\nbusiness may be omitted from the scope of the evaluation for a period of up to one year following the acquisition. Total assets\n(excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired) and revenue subject to ResortSuite’s internal control over financial reporting\nrepresented approximately 1% and less than 1% of our consolidated total assets and revenue, respectively, as of and for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of March 31, 2022.\nGrant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of March 31, 2022, which is included elsewhere in this annual report.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2022 that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nsignificant portions of our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2022. While we continue to adapt our work model in response to the ongoing global pandemic, we believe our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting continue to be effective.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nThe Company currently plans to hold its 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 26, 2022. Pursuant to the provisions of the\nCompany’s Bylaws, for any stockholder to propose business (other than pursuant to and in compliance with Exchange Act Rule 14a-\n8) or make a nomination before the annual meeting, the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the\nprincipal executive offices of the Company and received by the secretary not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the first\nanniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is\nadvanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 30 days from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely\nmust be so received not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth\n(10th) calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made.

          "content": "INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nQ2 FY2024\nForward-looking Statements & Non-GAAP\nFinancial Information\nForward-Looking Language\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-\nlooking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,”\n“should,” “will” and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, our revenue, subscription revenue and Adjusted EBITDA\nguidance for the 2024 fiscal year and statements we make regarding expected property management room growth.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions\nregarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking\nstatements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our\ncontrol. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these\nforward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking\nstatements include, among others, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the success of any measures we have taken or may take in the future in response\nthereto; and the risks described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We\nundertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether written or oral, whether as a result of new information,\nfuture developments or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement the unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in this press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined\nby the SEC rules are used. These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, adjusted diluted\nearnings per share and free cash flow. Management believes that such information can enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s ongoing operations.\n2\nAgilysys Private\nOur Mission\nThank You\nFor your partnership and\nyour business\nHelping Our Customers Improve Employee & Guest Experiences, With\nDedication To Past, Present & Future Customer Investments\nIn Our Products And Services.\n3\nAgilysys Private\nAgilysys Defining Strategy Pillars\n1 100% HOSPITALITY FOCUSED\nOBSESSIVELY CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 2\n3 CORE PRODUCT FOCUS & INNOVATION DRIVEN\nSTATE OF THE ART CLOUD-NATIVE & ON-PREMISE OPTIONS 4\n5 END-TO-END COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION OFFERINGS\n4\nAgilysys Private\n100% Hospitality Focused - Why It Matters\n5\nAgilysys Private\nObsessively Customer-Centric - Why It Matters\n6\nAgilysys Private\nCore Product Focus & Innovation Driven - Why It Matters\n7\nAgilysys Private\nState Of The Art Cloud-native & On-premise Options - Why It Matters\n8\nAgilysys Private\nEnd-To-End Comprehensive Solution Offerings - Why It Matters\n9\nAgilysys Private\nAgilysys Hospitality Product Suite\nA\nN\nR\nA\nE-L EY NT I GC AS G& E TRIP PLANNING TRIP BOOKING PRE-A\nR RI\nV\nA\nL\nFood & Hospitality Inventory &\nBeverage & Leisure Procurement\nR\nE\nS\nY\nS EIN\nE R- V\nV VE\nR AN\nU Document TU\nS OIE\nManagement N\nS\nP A Y E N U E S\nM E NTS I N - V NITIE\nIN-VENUE BACK OF A M E\nDINING HOUSE\nOPTIMIZATION\n3rd Party Solution Integration With Modern Restful APIs\n10\nAgilysys Private\nSolution Strategy Themes\nExtensible Experiences Staff2Guest Efficiency Future-Forward Fluidity\nThe same code engines inform multiple workflows Solutions adapt from staff-facing to guest- Systems – and Agilysys services teams -- are\nso solutions can be repurposed for multiple facing.
