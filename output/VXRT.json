(Nasdaq: VXRT) today announced its business update and financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“Our successful initiation of sentinel cohort dosing is a testament to our rapid execution in helping to ensure that we remain on track to meet the milestones of our Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) contract,” said Steven Lo, Vaxart’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are pleased to be nearing completion of enrollment of the sentinel cohort. Then, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board’s (DSMB’s) 30-day safety data review is favorable, we will initiate the 10,000-participant portion of the Phase 2b trial. Our continued progress brings us closer to our goal of demonstrating advantages of our mucosal technology against an approved mRNA vaccine.”\n\n“On our norovirus program, we received constructive feedback from the FDA on our proposed correlate of protection and are evaluating next steps,” Mr. Lo added. “Additionally, our scientific team created potentially more potent norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 constructs compared to the constructs previously evaluated in our clinical trials. We are excited about the potential these improvements may yield and remain committed to moving forward with our norovirus program.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccine Developments**\n\n  * In September 2024, Vaxart initiated the 400-participant sentinel cohort of its Phase 2b trial to evaluate Vaxart’s oral pill COVID-19 vaccine candidate against an approved mRNA vaccine comparator. The sentinel cohort is being funded as part of the Phase 2b NextGen COVID-19 clinical trial, valued at up to $456 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle under the U.S. government’s Project NextGen. \n    * Enrollment of the sentinel cohort is expected to be completed in November 2024. The 30-day safety data of the sentinel cohort will then be reviewed by the independent DSMB and the FDA.\n    * If the review of safety data by the DSMB and FDA is favorable, Vaxart expects the study to progress to the second part of the trial in early 2025 by enrolling approximately 10,000 participants.\n    * The primary efficacy analysis will be performed when all participants have either discontinued or completed a study visit 12 months post-vaccination.\n\n\n\n**Norovirus Vaccine Developments**\n\n  * In the second half of 2024, Vaxart held productive conversations with the FDA on its data for potential correlates of protection and next steps for Vaxart’s norovirus program. \n    * Based on the latest feedback, the FDA requested new clinical data before proceeding with further review of Vaxart’s potential correlate.\n    * Vaxart created additional norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 constructs that may be more potent than the constructs being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaxart is discussing regulatory feedback, clinical data on current constructs, and preclinical data generated on its new constructs with certain key opinion leaders in determining the best way to progress its norovirus program.\n  * In October 2024, Vaxart presented clinical research demonstrating the potential of its norovirus oral pill vaccine candidate at IDWeek.\n\n\n\n**Other Programs**\n\n  * In August 2024, preclinical data was published in _Vaccines,_ demonstrating the potential of Vaxart’s mucosal vaccine technology platform in enabling therapeutic vaccination against HPV-related cervical dysplasia.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $58.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Vaxart continues to anticipate cash runway into 2026.\n  * Vaxart reported a net loss of $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.06, compared to a net loss per share of $0.11 for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.9 million, compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily from government contracts related to the BARDA contracts awarded in January 2024 and June 2024. Revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily from revenue recognized for work performed under Vaxart’s grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and non-cash royalty revenue from increased sales of Inavir in Japan.\n  * Research and development expenses were $15.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The R&D expenses in the latest quarter were primarily due to increases in clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate and preclinical expenses across multiple programs and facilities expenses, partially offset by decreases in clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s norovirus vaccine candidate, stock-based compensation expenses and personnel-related costs, and manufacturing expenses.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in stock-based compensation expense and directors’ and officers’ insurance costs, partially offset by increases in legal and other professional fees.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call** The Vaxart senior management team will host a conference call to discuss the business update and financial results for the third quarter of 2024 today, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed using the following information:\n\nWebcast: [Click here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W9smsDJpImE-CUe4R57rlCjnWUBtxSy3QayZ0qXQpAgjqsXQF6Sbiu7cSBjo41j-MG82MCFC943i3-IfFiU4T1hHR-ossgug_s5E6hOHA1b-ZMOk01WyVL11e2E2Pmn-kH9_G9JhVkipilC_S-qGdA==)Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 – 4:30 p.m. ETDomestic: (877) 407-0832International: (201) 689-8433Conference ID: 13749666\n\nInvestors may submit written questions in advance of the conference call to [ir@vaxart.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BI06w_fcSVYq1ZC0JA9B6atf2JcM64D74qdEGf8B5vuhhvAdEbHivMUvR9seX9Men3JKzaGZ7aTUdc6uxMJpzA==).\n\nA replay of the webcast will be available for 30 days on Vaxart’s website at [www.vaxart.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TVyAC-YGrGZ7fPFXT2LCI1kNmjx5rpfhOd32ydVnnDbwujh64VTOZmPIkgfyHjbXSF_EGHar3cJdxfqTRtZXvw==) following the conclusion of the event.\n\n**About Vaxart **Vaxart is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a range of oral recombinant vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform.
