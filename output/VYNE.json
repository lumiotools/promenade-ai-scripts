(Nasdaq: VYNE) (“VYNE” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated therapies to treat chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions with high unmet need, today announced financial results as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update.\n\n“We continue to make excellent progress in advancing our two InhiBET™ clinical programs VYN201 and VYN202, and believe each product candidate has the potential to be a differentiated, class-leading therapy for immune-mediated diseases,” said David Domzalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of VYNE. “We recently reported positive SAD data from our Phase 1a SAD/MAD trial of oral, BD2-selective BET inhibitor, VYN202, and we anticipate reporting data from the MAD portion of the trial later this quarter. We are encouraged by the strong enrollment in our ongoing Phase 2b trial for VYN201 which we believe underscores the significant unmet need in the treatment of vitiligo. We expect to complete enrollment next month and report topline data mid- next year.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Updates**\n\n**_VYN201, a locally-administered small molecule pan-BD BET inhibitor:_**\n\n  * **Phase 2b trial of VYN201 in nonsegmental vitiligo exceeds initial enrollment target and expected to complete enrollment next month.** The Phase 2b trial is expected to be fully enrolled in December 2024, with approximately 40 to 50 subjects per arm. The trial was initiated in June 2024 and VYNE expects to report top-line results from the 24-week double-blind portion of the trial in mid-2025.\n  * The Phase 2b trial (NCT06493578) is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-daily VYN201 gel in three dose cohorts (1%, 2% and 3% concentrations) compared to vehicle for 24 weeks. Subjects are being randomized equally (1:1:1:1 ratio) across the active drug cohorts or vehicle. Following the 24-week treatment period, subjects who have been randomized in the three dose cohorts will have the option to continue treatment with their respective dose concentrations for an additional 28-week extension. Subjects who have been randomized in the vehicle group during the initial 24-week treatment period will be equally re-randomized into one of the three active dose cohorts for an additional 28 weeks.\n\n\n\n**_VYN202, an oral small molecule BD2-selective inhibitor:_**\n\n  * **VYNE expects to report top-line results from the multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) portion of the Phase 1a trial in the fourth quarter of 2024.** Data from the single ascending dose (“SAD”) portion of the trial, announced in September 2024, showed that VYN202 was generally well tolerated with no drug related adverse events. Assessment of key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters demonstrated dose dependent drug concentrations of VYN202 in the blood and showed pharmacodynamic impact of VYN202 on key target-engagement and inflammatory biomarkers in whole blood assays, including an inhibitory effect on select inflammatory biomarkers relevant to psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n  * Pending successful completion of the Phase 1a trial, VYNE plans to initiate Phase 1b trials in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis, with top-line results anticipated in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results as of and for the****Third** **Quarter****Ended****September 30, 2024**\n\n**_Cash position._** As of September 30, 2024, VYNE had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $70.2 million. VYNE believes its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of 2025.\n\n**_Share count._** As of September 30, 2024, VYNE had 14,751,433 shares issued and outstanding, and outstanding pre-funded warrants to purchase 27,842,740 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share.\n\n**_Revenues._** Revenues totaled $0.1 million for both the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting of royalty revenue from the Company's royalty agreement with LEO Pharma, to whom VYNE previously licensed the rights to Finacea® foam.\n\n**_Research and development expenses_**. VYNE’s research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $10.2 million, representing an increase of $6.9 million, or 208.9%, compared to $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased expenses associated with VYNE's ongoing Phase 2b trial of VYN201 in subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo and its ongoing Phase 1a SAD/MAD trial of VYN202 of $5.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Both trials were initiated in June 2024. In addition, employee-related expenses increased by $0.3 million following the hiring of additional research and development personnel.\n\n**_General and administrative expenses._** VYNE’s general and administrative expenses for both the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $3.0 million, representing an immaterial change year-over-year.\n\n**_Net loss._** Net loss and net loss per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $12.2 million and $0.29, respectively, compared to a net loss and net loss per share of $6.6 million and $2.01, respectively, for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n**About VYNE Therapeutics Inc.**\n\nVYNE is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated therapies to treat chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions with high unmet need.

(Nasdaq: VYNE) (“VYNE” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated therapies to treat chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions with high unmet need, today announced positive data from the single ascending dose (“SAD”) portion of its ongoing Phase 1a trial of VYN202. The Phase 1a trial is a two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers consisting of SAD and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) components to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and pharmacodynamics of VYN202. Findings from the SAD portion of the Phase 1a trial to date are as follows:\n\n**VYN202 Was Generally Well Tolerated Across All Dose Groups**\n\nSingle ascending doses of VYN202 across all cohorts were generally well tolerated up to and including the highest planned dose level. There were no serious adverse events, drug-related adverse events, or clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory results or electrocardiogram findings.\n\n**VYN202 Demonstrated Dose-Dependent PK**\n\nVYN202 also met expected PK parameters, with plasma and urine drug concentrations of VYN202 increasing in a dose-dependent manner across all doses tested.\n\n**VYN202 Demonstrated Pharmacodynamic Effects**\n\nParticipant blood samples were stimulated ex-vivo to assess the pharmacodynamic impact of single doses of VYN202 on key target-engagement and inflammatory biomarkers. Results demonstrated an increase in marker protein HEXIM1, indicative of target engagement of VYN202 with BET proteins1. Additionally, exploratory data from the SAD arm showed that single doses of VYN202 demonstrated biological activity and an inhibitory effect on select inflammatory biomarkers relevant to psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**Phase 1a MAD Portion of Trial Initiated**\n\nThe primary objectives of the MAD portion of the Phase 1a trial are to assess safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of VYN202 over 14 days at different dose levels. Results are expected in Q4 2024.\n\n“These results from our SAD trial mark the first clinical data for our BD2-selective BET inhibitor, VYN202, and represent an important milestone for our Company and the development of our BET inhibitor platform,” said David Domzalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of VYNE. “We look forward to further assessing safety and PK as well as VYN202’s potential to impact several relevant biomarkers following multiple doses, which we expect to disclose next quarter. These data would inform the design of our planned studies in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.”\n\n**About VYN202** VYN202 is an innovative, oral small molecule BET inhibitor that has potential class-leading selectivity and potency for BD2 vs. BD1. By maximizing BD2 selectivity, VYNE believes VYN202 has the potential to be a more conveniently administered non-biologic treatment option for both acute control and chronic management of immuno-inflammatory indications, in which the damaging effects of unrestricted inflammatory signaling activity is common. VYN202 is structurally distinct from VYNE’s pan-BET inhibitor (VYN201) and covered by distinct Patent Cooperation Treaty and provisional composition of matter patent applications directed to new chemical entities and their uses.\n\n**About BET Inhibitors** BET proteins play a key role in regulating gene transcription via epigenetic interactions (“reading”). Recent research has identified a key role for these proteins in regulating activation of immune cells, including T and B cells, and subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic processes. As epigenetic readers, BET proteins regulate the recruitment of transcriptional factors that are key to the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. BET inhibitors have the potential to treat a range of immuno-inflammatory and fibrotic diseases by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription, with additional potential in myeloproliferative neoplastic disorders.\n\n1.

VYNE’s unique and proprietary BET inhibitors, which comprise its InhiBET™ platform, are designed to overcome limitations of early generation BET inhibitors by leveraging alternative routes of administration and enhanced selectivity. \n\nFor more information about VYNE Therapeutics Inc. or its product candidates, visit [www.vynetherapeutics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JJKqhmw9Hl_ItScJrxRrXbbEO9wZky8Q7THHu6aoS2nIOg03oApDdGbCPf-NTwh_iIScI3lxVlryiGP2qOznTSo7w2XHvcGiTx6Fktv20cg= \"www.vynetherapeutics.com\").

(Nasdaq: VYNE) (“VYNE” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated therapies to treat chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions with high unmet need, today announced financial results as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and provided a business update.\n\n“We advanced our clinical programs in the second quarter of 2024, highlighted by the initiation of our Phase 2b trial of VYN201 and the Phase 1a trial of VYN202,” said David Domzalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of VYNE. “We are pleased with the progress we are making with both clinical programs. We remain on track to report top-line data from our Phase 2b clinical trial for VYN201 in subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo in the middle of next year. We also expect to report top-line data from the single ascending dose portion of the Phase 1a trial of VYN202 this quarter, followed by results from the multiple ascending dose portion in the fourth quarter. Upon the successful completion of this Phase 1a trial, we plan to advance VYN202 into two Phase 1b proof-of-concept trials with top-line readouts in the second half of next year.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Updates**\n\n**_VYN201_**\n\n  * VYN201 is a locally administered pan-bromodomain (“BD”) BET inhibitor designed as a “soft” drug to address diseases involving multiple, diverse inflammatory cell signaling pathways while providing low systemic exposure. VYNE initiated a Phase 2b trial of VYN201 in nonsegmental vitiligo in June 2024. [_The Phase 2b trial_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a9fzeXftbh9XDpyN08AsALPrr_P9mTbipWAE8QY0v2mv3Yev-voNMku8-YVaxI6y1ZhaatX9fltNBF94_jR55BZg0GCMJ8xVjikDlq0nnVnplo16IdN97A9YoFGphvhznPRCDyNRMr5zWoP2tq8nY9YSKNvDYo38Kw2lWO0xg55T1D1dtQKUBd5Q5FD6arNF) is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-daily VYN201 gel in three dose cohorts (1%, 2% and 3% concentrations) compared to vehicle for 24 weeks. Subjects are being randomized at 1:1:1:1 ratio. Following the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the 1%, 2%, and 3% cohorts will continue treatment with their respective dose concentrations for an additional 28-week open label extension. Subjects in the vehicle group during the initial 24-week treatment period will be equally re-randomized to receive VYN201 1%, 2% or 3% gel for an additional 28 weeks. VYNE expects to enroll approximately 40 subjects in each arm and to report top-line results from the 24-week double-blind portion of the trial in mid-2025.\n\n\n\n**V**** _YN202_**\n\n  * VYN202 is an oral small molecule BD2-selective BET inhibitor designed to achieve potential class-leading selectivity and potency (BD2 vs. BD1). A first-in-human Phase 1a single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose (“SAD/MAD”) trial was initiated in June 2024. VYNE expects to report top-line results from the SAD and MAD portions of the trial in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively. If the Phase 1a trial is successfully completed, VYNE plans to initiate Phase 1b trials in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, with top-line results anticipated in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Update**\n\n  * In July, VYNE appointed Subhashis Banerjee, M.D., as Senior Vice President of Clinical Development. Dr. Banerjee is a trained immunologist and rheumatologist with over 25 years of drug development experience at large pharmaceutical companies, including the development of therapies for psoriasis and arthritic conditions. He most recently served as Vice President & Disease Area Head, Rheumatology and Dermatology at Bristol Myers Squibb. Dr. Banerjee played a key role in the development strategy of immunology assets across multiple platforms for several immune-mediated diseases, including SOTYKTU® (deucravacitinib), ORENCIA® (abatacept), clazakizumab (anti-IL-6 antibody), TALTZ® (ixekizumab, anti-IL-17 antibody) and XELJANZ® (tofacitinib).\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Conference Participation**\n\n  * H.C. Wainwright 26th Annual Global Investment Conference, September 9-11, 2024, New York, NY\n  * Stifel Immunology and Inflammation Virtual Summit, September 17-18, 2024\n\n\n\n**Financial Results as of and for the****Second** **Quarter****Ended****June 30, 2024**\n\n**_Cash position._** As of June 30, 2024, VYNE had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $78.1 million. VYNE believes its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of 2025.\n\n**_Revenues._** Revenues totaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting of royalty revenue from the Company’s royalty agreement with LEO Pharma, to whom VYNE previously licensed the rights to Finacea® foam.\n\n**_Research and development expenses_**. VYNE’s research and development expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $7.3 million, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 1.0%, compared to $7.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by expenses related to preparatory and clinical trial activities for a Phase 2b trial of VYN201 in subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo, which was initiated in June 2024, of $3.2 million, including a $1.0 million development milestone payment due to Tay Therapeutics Ltd. (“Tay”) upon the initiation of the Phase 2b trial. In addition, employee-related expenses increased by $0.3 million following the hiring of additional research and development personnel. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with VYN202 of $3.5 million, primarily driven by lower amounts owed to Tay under the license agreement with respect to VYN202 (the “VYN202 License Agreement”). In April 2023, VYNE made a one-time cash payment of $3.75 million to Tay in connection with entering into the VYN202 License Agreement. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company incurred a $1.0 million development milestone payment due to Tay following the initiation of a Phase 1a SAD/MAD trial of VYN202.\n\n**_General and administrative expenses._** VYNE’s general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $3.3 million, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 2.1%, compared to $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by consulting and professional fees.\n\n**_Net loss._** Net loss and net loss per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $9.4 million and $0.22, respectively, compared to a net loss and net loss per share of $10.1 million and $3.09, respectively for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n**About VYNE Therapeutics Inc.**\n\nVYNE is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated therapies to treat chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions with high unmet need.

This granted patent covers the compound in VYNE’s VYN202 program and has a 20-year term that will expire in June 2042.\n\n“The granting of this composition of matter patent is key to the development of VYN202, which we believe is the most potent and BD2-selective BET inhibitor in development,” said David Domzalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of VYNE. “Obtaining intellectual property protection is an important value driver for VYNE and we will continue to seek protection in additional jurisdictions as we progress our BET inhibitor pipeline.”\n\nThis newly issued patent is derived from Tay Therapeutics Limited’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application No. WO 2023/275542 A1, which was filed nationally in multiple jurisdictions, and is exclusively licensed to VYNE. This patent is the first of the national filed applications to be granted.\n\n**About VYN202** VYN202 is an innovative, oral small molecule BET inhibitor that has potential class-leading selectivity and potency (BD2 vs. BD1). By maximizing BD2 selectivity, VYNE believes VYN202 has the potential to be a more conveniently administered non-biologic treatment option for both acute control and chronic management of immuno-inflammatory indications, in which the damaging effects of unrestricted inflammatory signaling activity is common. VYN202 is structurally distinct from VYNE’s pan-BET inhibitor (VYN201) and covered by distinct PCT and provisional composition of matter patent applications directed to new chemical entities and their uses.\n\n**About BET Inhibitors** BET proteins play a key role in regulating gene transcription via epigenetic interactions (“reading”), and recent research has identified a key role for these proteins in regulating B cell and T cell activation and subsequent inflammatory processes. As epigenetic readers, BET proteins regulate the recruitment of transcriptional factors that are key to the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. BET inhibitors have the potential to treat a range of immuno-inflammatory and fibrotic diseases by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription with additional potential in myeloproliferative neoplastic disorders.\n\n**About VYNE Therapeutics Inc.** VYNE’s mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory conditions. The Company’s unique and proprietary bromodomain & extra-terminal (BET) domain inhibitors, which comprise its InhiBET™ platform, include a locally administered pan-BD BET inhibitor (VYN201) and an orally available BD2-selective BET inhibitor (VYN202) that were licensed from Tay Therapeutics Limited. \n\nFor more information about VYNE Therapeutics Inc. or its product candidates, visit [www.vynetherapeutics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o7JiGVIEP1nJHvTd4YsCQgFBq3YAL-SXcSOYWJsKScFvab3zwQU-GLytijHG0lWFgCIu3Y-ADGQxB9Bs2LjDbdJiJ7s9ni_zAYJp_-Diqo0= \"www.vynetherapeutics.com\").
