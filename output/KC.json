The accelerated growth of high-quality business, such as AI, has offset the decline in the low-margin CDN business due to strategic proactive adjustments.\n  * **Gross profit** was RMB303.4 million (US$43.2 million), representing a significant increase of 54.6% from RMB196.2 million in the same quarter of 2023. Our profitability has been fundamentally improved.\n  * **Non-GAAP EBITDA****2** was RMB185.4 million (US$26.4 million), compared with RMB-45.4 million in the same quarter of 2023. **Non-GAAP EBITDA margin** was 9.8%, compared with -2.8% in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nMr. Tao Zou, Chief Executive Officer of Kingsoft Cloud, commented, “This quarter, our steadfast belief in, and unwavering execution of the ‘High-quality and Sustainable Development Strategy’ continued to deliver strong results. We are excited to announce further accelerated topline growth of 16%, with fast-increasing Non-GAAP EBITDA margin reaching 9.8% in the third quarter of 2024. In particular, AI business continued to expand to RMB362 million, accounting for approximately 31% of public cloud revenue. Meanwhile, as we wholeheartedly embrace the Xiaomi and Kingsoft Ecosystem and tap into the vast tangible opportunities from EV car, LLM to WPS AI, to name a few, we grew our revenues from the Ecosystem by a significant year-over-year increase of 36%. We are confident that we are on the right track and momentum to building more success in the future.”\n\nMr. Henry He, Chief Financial Officer of Kingsoft Cloud, added, “We recorded another strong quarter with growth in both revenue and profits. The Company achieved a double-digit year-on-year growth in total revenue, reaching RMB1,885.6 million, restoring the high-speed growth of revenue. Meanwhile, the growth rates of our gross profit and EBITDA profit far exceed the industry average level. Compared with the adjusted gross profit margin of 3.6% in the second quarter of 2022, which was before the Company carried out business structure adjustment and AI transformation, a 4.5-fold growth to 16.3% was achieved in this quarter; and the adjusted EBITDA margin has been significantly improved from a loss of 8.6% in the second quarter of 2022 to a profit of 9.8%, with an increase of 18.4 percentage points. The Company’s revenue structure adjustment and AI strategic transformation have achieved remarkable results.”\n\n______________________1 This announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (RMB) amounts into U.S. dollars (US$) at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, the translation of RMB into US$ has been made at RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on September 30, 2024 as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\n2 Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as Non-GAAP net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, and we define Non-GAAP EBITDA margin as Non-GAAP EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Total Revenues** reached RMB1,885.6 million (US$268.73 million), increased by 16.0% year-over-year from RMB1,625.2 million in the same quarter of 2023 and remained flat quarter-over-quarter from RMB1,891.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the expanded revenue from Xiaomi and Kingsoft Ecosystem and AI related customers, incremental demands from enterprise cloud and partially offset by our proactive scale-down of low-margin content delivery network (CDN) services.\n\nRevenues from public cloud services were RMB1,175.5 million (US$167.5 million), increased by 15.6% from RMB1,016.6 million in the same quarter of 2023 and decreased by 4.8% from RMB1,234.5 million last quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the growth of AI demands and partially offset by the proactive scale-down of our CDN services.\n\nRevenues from enterprise cloud services were RMB710.0 million (US$101.2 million), representing an increase of 16.7% from RMB608.5 million in the same quarter of 2023 and an increase of 8.0% from RMB657.2 million last quarter. We keep focus on selected verticals such as public services cloud, state-owned assets cloud, healthcare and financial services, leverage Camelot’s capability to cater for the IT development, enhance our solutions with AI capabilities and take profitability and sustainability of the enterprise cloud projects as our priorities.\n\nOther revenues were nil this quarter.\n\n**Cost of revenues** was RMB1,582.2 million (US$225.5 million), representing an increase of 10.7% from RMB1,429.0 million in the same quarter of 2023. IDC costs decreased significantly by 8.7% year-over-year from RMB737.7 million to RMB673.8 million (US$96.0 million) this quarter. The decrease was in line with the scale-down of our CDN services and our strict control over procurement costs. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by 48.5% from RMB200.4 million in the same quarter of 2023 to RMB297.5 million (US$42.4 million) this quarter. The increase was mainly due to the depreciation of newly acquired electronic equipments which were related to AI business. Solution development and services costs increased by 17.3% year-over-year from RMB425.3 million in the same quarter of 2023 to RMB499.0 million (US$71.1 million) this quarter. The increase was mainly due to the solution personnel expansion of Camelot. Fulfillment costs and other costs were RMB59.5 million (US$8.5 million) and RMB52.3 million (US$7.5 million) this quarter.\n\n**Gross profit** was RMB303.4 million (US$43.2 million), representing a significant increase of 54.6% from RMB196.2 million in the same quarter of 2023, demonstrating our improvements in revenue quality and structure. **Gross margin** was 16.1%, compared with 12.1% in the same period in 2023. **Non-GAAP gross profit** 4 was RMB307.6 million (US$43.8 million), compared with RMB196.3 million in the same period in 2023. **Non-GAAP gross margin****4** was 16.3%, compared with 12.1% in the same period in 2023. The significant improvements of our gross profit and margin were mainly due to our strategic adjustment of revenue mix, expansion of AI revenues, optimized enterprise cloud project selection and efficient cost control measures, while partially offset under pressure of bandwidth costs increase and price fluctuation of certain customer.\n\n______________________3 This announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (RMB) amounts into U.S. dollars (US$) at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.

In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating loss, Non-GAAP operating loss margin, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP net loss margin, as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding share-based compensation allocated in the cost of revenues, and we define Non-GAAP gross margin as Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss excluding share-based compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and amortization of intangible assets and we define Non-GAAP operating loss margin as Non-GAAP operating loss as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss and impairment of long-lived assets, and we define Non-GAAP net loss margin as Non-GAAP net loss as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as Non-GAAP net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, and we define Non-GAAP EBITDA margin as Non-GAAP EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**_Exchan_****g**** _e Rate Information_**\n\nThis press release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.

Our _high-quality_ _and_ _sustainable_ _development_ strategy continued to bear fruits. During the past quarter, embracing AI opportunities, we have recorded AI revenue of RMB326 million, approximately 26% of revenues from public cloud services, doubling from 13% last quarter. We have also been enhancing our AI capabilities, successfully deploying AI solutions to enterprises and organizations to improve our customers’ data management performances.”\n\nMr. Henry He, Chief Financial Officer of Kingsoft Cloud, added, “We are pleased to achieve growth in both revenue and profits. This quarter our total revenues returned to year-over-year growth track, arriving at RMB1,891.8 million, increased by 3.1% year-over-year and 6.5% quarter-over-quarter. This quarter our adjusted gross margin was 17.1%, significantly increased by 5.8 percentage points from 11.3% in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit was RMB323.4 million, increased by 56.4% from RMB206.8 million in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA turned to profit last quarter and steadily increased to RMB60.6 million, significantly improving from negative RMB61.4 million in the same quarter of 2023. This quarter we have recorded net inflow of operating cash at RMB151.2 million, compared with RMB65.2 million in the same period and negative RMB321.3 million last quarter.”\n\n**_Second_** **_Quarter_** **_2024_** **_Financial_** **_Results_**\n\n**Total** **revenues** reached RMB1,891.8 million (US$260.31 million), increased by 3.1% year-over-year and 6.5% quarter-over-quarter from RMB1,835.4 million in the same quarter of 2023 and RMB1,775.7 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was mainly due to the expanded revenue from AI related customers and partially offset by our proactive scale-down of content delivery network (CDN) services, and more stringent project selection of enterprise cloud projects.\n\nRevenues from public cloud services were RMB1,234.5 million (US$169.9 million), increased by 6.5% from RMB1,159.5 million in the same quarter of 2023 and 4.0% from RMB1,187.4 million last quarter. The increase was mainly due to the growth of AI demands and partially offset by the proactive scale-down of our CDN services.\n\nRevenues from enterprise cloud services were RMB657.2 million (US$90.4 million), representing a decrease of 2.7% from RMB675.2 million in the same quarter of 2023 and an increase of 11.7% from RMB588.2 million last quarter. We keep focus in selected verticals such as public services cloud, state-owned assets cloud, healthcare and financial services, enhance our solutions with AI capabilities and take profitability and sustainability of the enterprise cloud projects as our priorities.\n\nOther revenues were nil this quarter.\n\n**Cost** **of** **revenues** was RMB1,573.4 million (US$216.5 million), representing a decrease of 3.4% from RMB1,628.8 million in the same quarter of 2023. IDC costs decreased significantly by 15.4% year-over-year from RMB860.7 million to RMB728.2 million (US$100.2 million) this quarter. The decrease was in line with the scale down of our CDN services and our strict control over procurement costs. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by 31.6% from RMB202.1 million in the same quarter of 2023 to RMB265.9 million (US$36.6 million) this quarter. The increase was mainly due to the depreciation of _newly_ acquired servers which were allocated to AI business. Solution development and services costs increased by 8.4% year-over-year from RMB452.9 million in the same quarter of 2023 to RMB491.1 million (US$67.6 million) this quarter. The increase was mainly due to the solution personnel expansion of Camelot. Fulfillment costs and other costs were RMB37.6 million (US$5.2 million) and RMB50.6 million (US$6.9 million) this quarter.\n\n______________________1 This announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (RMB) amounts into U.S. dollars (US$) at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.

The significant improvement of our gross profit and margin was mainly due to our strategic adjustment of revenue mix, expansion of AI revenues, optimized enterprise cloud project selection and efficient cost control measures.\n\n**Total operating expenses** were RMB595.9 million (US$82.0 million), increased by 4.6% from RMB569.7 million in the same period in 2023 and 5.0% from RMB567.4 million last quarter. Among which:\n\n**Selling** **and** **marketing** **expenses** were RMB125.7 million (US$17.3 million), decreased by 2.7% from RMB129.3 million in the same period in 2023 and increased by 7.7% from RMB116.8 million last quarter, the sequential increase was due to the increase of personnel costs and promotional expense, partially offsetting by the reversal of share-based compensation related to forfeiture.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** were RMB266.2 million (US$36.6 million), compared with RMB246.5 million in the same period in 2023 and RMB218.7 million last quarter. The sequential increase was mainly due to the one-time-off gain of property disposal of last quarter and the year- over-year increase was mainly due to the increase in personnel costs.\n\n**Research** **and** **development** **expenses** were RMB204.0 million (US$28.1 million), increased by 5.2% from RMB193.9 million in the same period in 2023 and decreased by 12.1% from RMB232.0 million last quarter. The sequential decrease was mainly due to the reversal of share-based compensation expense related to forfeiture and the year-over-year increase was mainly due to the increase in personnel costs, partially offsetting by the reversal of share-based compensation related to forfeiture.\n\n**Operating** **loss** was RMB277.6 million (US$38.2 million), significantly decreased compared with operating loss of RMB363.1 million in the same quarter of 2023 and slightly increased from RMB274.2 million last quarter. The year-over-year improvement was mainly due to our gross profit expansion and we have been taking strict control over expenses, bearing fruit from our high-quality and sustainable development strategy. The sequential _increase_ was mainly due to the above-mentioned expenses increase and partially offset by the increase of gross profit.\n\n**Net** **loss** was RMB353.7 million (US$48.7 million), significantly decreased compared with net loss of RMB498.3 million in the same quarter of 2023 and RMB363.6 million last quarter. The improvements of our profitability were in line with our strategies of high quality and sustainable development, as we focus on profitable business and execute strict control over costs and expenses.\n\n______________________2 Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding share-based compensation allocated in the cost of revenues and we define Non-GAAP gross margin as Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**Non-****GAAP** **net** **loss****3** was RMB301.1 million (US$41.4 million), compared with RMB315.0 million in the same quarter of 2023 and RMB217.3 million last quarter.\n\n**Non-GAAP** **EBITDA****4** was RMB60.6 million (US$8.3 million), compared with RMB-61.4 million in the same quarter of 2023 and RMB33.2 million last quarter. **Non-GAAP** **EBITDA** **margin** was 3.2%, compared with -3.3% in the same quarter of 2023 and 1.9% last quarter. The increase was mainly due to the expansion in gross profit and our strict control over costs and expenses.\n\n**Basic** **and** **diluted** **net** **loss** **per** **share** was RMB0.10 (US$0.01), compared with RMB0.14 in the same quarter of 2023 and RMB0.10 last quarter.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** were RMB1,837.8 million (US$252.9 million) as of June 30, 2024, compared with RMB1,881.7 million as of March 31, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the investment into the procurement of high performance servers and the payment to daily operation.\n\n**Outstanding** **ordinary** **shares** were 3,596,874,352 as of June 30, 2024, equivalent to about 239,791,623 ADSs.\n\n**_Conference_** **_Call_** **_Information_**\n\nKingsoft Cloud’s management will host an earnings conference call on Tuesday, August 20, 2024 at 8:15 am, U.S. Eastern Time (8:15 pm, Beijing/Hong Kong Time on the same day).\n\nParticipants can register for the conference call by navigating to https://register.vevent.com/ register/BI2ed9e3a7930e4c958cfbd29da2a97c19.

See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n4 Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as Non-GAAP net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense _(benefit)_ and depreciation and amortization, and we define Non-GAAP EBITDA margin as Non-GAAP EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**_Use_** **_of_** **_Non-GAAP_** **_Financial_** **_Measures_**\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP net loss margin, as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding share-based compensation allocated in the cost of revenues, and we define Non-GAAP gross margin as Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss and impairment of long-lived assets, and we define Non-GAAP net loss margin as Non-GAAP net loss as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as Non-GAAP net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, and we define Non-GAAP EBITDA margin as Non-GAAP EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**_Exchange_** **_Rate_** **_Information_**\n\nThis press release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
