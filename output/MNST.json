Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were adversely impacted by a $16.7 million provision and $1.2 million of Company incurred legal expenses (collectively, the “Hansen Expenses”) in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the descendants of Hubert Hansen, in relation to the Company’s use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, which closed in 2015. Net of tax, these items adversely impacted net income for the 2024 third quarter by $21.5 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share.\n\n_Items impacting profitability in the 2023 third quarter:_ On July 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its debtor affiliates (the “Bang Transaction”). Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value (the “Bang Inventory Step-Up”). Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $45.4 million (the “Bang Transaction Gain”) in interest and other income (expense), net. During the 2023 third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $8.0 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang Transaction (the “Bang Transaction Expenses”). Net of tax, these items positively impacted net income for the 2023 third quarter by $22.7 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share.\n\nThe tables at the end of this press release summarize the income statement impact of the selected items discussed above for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (See “Adjusted Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Information” and “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” below).\n\n**Third Quarter Results** Net sales for the 2024 third quarter increased 1.3 percent to $1.88 billion, from $1.86 billion in the comparable period last year. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 third quarter of $62.8 million ($26.5 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 4.7 percent (5.0 percent excluding the Alcohol Brands segment) in the 2024 third quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, increased 0.8 percent to $1.72 billion for the 2024 third quarter, from $1.71 billion for the 2023 third quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $52.8 million for the 2024 third quarter ($26.5 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased 3.9 percent in the 2024 third quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands Predator® and Fury®, increased 14.0 percent to $112.6 million for the 2024 third quarter, from $98.8 million in the 2023 third quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $10.0 million for the 2024 third quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Strategic Brands segment increased 24.1 percent in the 2024 third quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of The BeastTM, Nasty Beast™ Hard Tea, as well as various craft beers and hard seltzers, decreased 6.0 percent to $39.8 million for the 2024 third quarter, from $42.3 million in the 2023 third quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreased sales by volume of craft beers.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Other segment, which primarily includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers, decreased 11.5 percent to $5.9 million for the 2024 third quarter, from $6.7 million in the 2023 third quarter.\n\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 3.6 percent to $760.1 million in the 2024 third quarter, from $733.7 million in the 2023 third quarter. Such sales were approximately 40.4 percent of total net sales for the 2024 third quarter compared with 39.5 percent in the 2023 third quarter.

Gross profit for the 2024 third quarter was adversely impacted by the Alcohol Brands Inventory Reserves. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter, exclusive of the Alcohol Brands Inventory Reserves was 53.7 percent. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was primarily the result of lower input costs, pricing actions in certain international markets and the Bang Inventory Step-Up (included in the comparative 2023 third quarter), partially offset by higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales, mainly to drive trial and awareness of the Bang Energy® brand in the United States, as well as the Alcohol Brands Inventory Reserves.\n\nOperating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $519.9 million, compared with $473.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter were 27.6 percent, compared with 25.5 percent in the 2023 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter included the Hansen Expenses.\n\nDistribution expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $82.7 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, compared with $85.7 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, in the 2023 third quarter.\n\nSelling expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $196.1 million, or 10.4 percent of net sales, compared with $177.2 million, or 9.5 percent of net sales, in the 2023 third quarter.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $241.1 million, or 12.8 percent of net sales, compared with $210.3 million, or 11.3 percent of net sales, for the 2023 third quarter.

Adjusted operating income for the 2024 third quarter was $508.4 million, compared with $526.8 million in the 2023 third quarter. (See “Adjusted Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Information” and “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” below).\n\nThe effective tax rate for the 2024 third quarter was 21.8 percent, compared with 22.2 percent in the 2023 third quarter.\n\nNet income for the 2024 third quarter decreased 18.1 percent to $370.9 million, from $452.7 million in the 2023 third quarter. Adjusted net income for the 2024 third quarter decreased 8.8 percent to $392.4 million from adjusted net income of $430.0 million in the 2023 third quarter.

(See “Adjusted Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Information” and “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” below).\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “The energy drink category continues to grow globally and has demonstrated resilience. In the United States, the energy drink category continued to experience slower growth rates. However, in all measured channels excluding convenience, the energy drink category is growing at a faster rate. In the United States, the energy drink category in the convenience channel is beginning to show some improvement in October. A number of other consumer packaged goods companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment for certain income groups and weaker demand in the quarter. \n\n“We believe growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption, along with consumers’ growing need for energy are positive trends for the category.\n\n“Our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels continued to grow.\n\n“Our third quarter financial results were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets. On a foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brands segment, net sales increased 5.0 percent in the quarter. We estimate that diluted earnings per share were adversely impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in September and October 2024, however we cannot determine the impact on our business.\n\n“Gross profit margins improved in the 2024 third quarter, compared with the 2023 third quarter, both on a reported and adjusted basis and were higher on an adjusted basis compared with the 2024 second quarter.\n\n“As previously reported, we have implemented an approximately 5.0 percent price increase on our brands and packages, excluding Bang Energy®, Reign® and Reign Storm® in the United States, effective November 1, 2024,” Schlosberg added.\n\nRodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “Innovation continues to play a key role in our strategy. Globally our innovation has been generally well received by our bottlers/distributors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. We launched Monster Energy® Ultra Vice Guava™ in the United States in October, with positive consumer response.\n\n“Predator Energy® Gold Strike, launched in April 2024 in selected provinces in China, continues to perform and plans are underway to accelerate its rollout into further markets in China.\n\n“Our Alcohol Brands segment has now been restructured under new management and we remain positive for the prospects of alcohol products within our broader portfolio. In the 2024 third quarter, we launched a second variety pack of The BeastTM in a 12-pack of slim 12-oz cans, comprising of Mean Green, Pink Poison, Gnarly Grape and Killer Sunrise. We are currently exploring opportunities for distribution of our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. \n\n“Our innovation pipeline for both our non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages remains robust,” Sacks said. **2024 Nine-Months Results** Net sales for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.0 percent to $5.68 billion, from $5.41 billion in the comparable period last year.

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 second quarter of $67.7 million ($34.0 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 6.1 percent (7.4 percent excluding the Alcohol Brands segment) in the 2024 second quarter. \n\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks, Bang Energy® drinks and Monster Tour Water®, increased 3.3 percent to $1.74 billion for the 2024 second quarter, from $1.69 billion for the 2023 second quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $53.6 million for the 2024 second quarter ($34.0 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased 6.5 percent in the 2024 second quarter (4.5 percent exclusive of Argentina’s impact).\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands Predator® and Fury®, increased 9.6 percent to $109.2 million for the 2024 second quarter, from $99.7 million in the 2023 second quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $14.0 million for the 2024 second quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Strategic Brands segment increased 23.6 percent in the 2024 second quarter. \n\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of The Beast Unleashed®, Nasty Beast™ Hard Tea, as well as various craft beers and hard seltzers, decreased 31.9 percent to $41.6 million for the 2024 second quarter, from $61.1 million in the 2023 second quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreased sales by volume of flavored malt beverages.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Other segment, which primarily includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), decreased 4.2 percent to $7.0 million for the 2024 second quarter, from $7.3 million in the 2023 second quarter.\n\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 4.3 percent to $746.0 million in the 2024 second quarter, from $715.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. Such sales were approximately 39 percent of total net sales in both the 2024 and 2023 second quarters. Net sales to customers outside the United States, on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 13.7 percent in the 2024 second quarter (9.0 percent exclusive of Argentina’s impact).\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter was 53.6 percent, compared with 52.5 percent in the 2023 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower aluminum can costs, partially offset by production inefficiencies.\n\nOperating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $492.3 million, compared with $450.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter were 25.9 percent, compared with 24.3 percent in the 2023 second quarter. \n\nDistribution expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $87.4 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, compared with $82.0 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, in the 2023 second quarter.\n\nSelling expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $192.1 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales, compared with $172.6 million, or 9.3 percent of net sales, in the 2023 second quarter.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $212.8 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, compared with $195.8 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, for the 2023 second quarter. Stock-based compensation was $18.8 million for the 2024 second quarter, compared with $18.6 million in the 2023 second quarter.\n\nOperating income for the 2024 second quarter was $527.2 million, compared with $523.8 million in the 2023 second quarter.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the 2024 second quarter was 22.9 percent, compared with 23.2 percent in the 2023 second quarter. \n\nNet income for the 2024 second quarter increased 2.8 percent to $425.4 million, from $413.9 million in the 2023 second quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2024 second quarter increased 5.0 percent to $0.41, from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic and we have seen a shift at retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter. \n\n“The energy category globally continues to grow and has demonstrated resilience, as we believe that consumers view energy drinks as an ‘affordable luxury.’ \n\n“Growth opportunities in penetration, per capita consumption, along with consumers’ growing need for energy are positive trends for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels.\n\n“We achieved another quarter of solid revenue growth, with record second quarter sales. The quarter was again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets.\n\n“Gross profit margins improved in the second quarter, compared with the 2023 second quarter. This improvement was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower aluminum can costs, partially offset by production inefficiencies. On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were 0.5 percent below first quarter margins primarily as a result of higher allowances, certain of which we believe are non-recuring as well as production inefficiencies.\n\n“As previously reported, we will be taking an approximately 5 percent price increase on our core brands and packages in the United States, effective November 1, 2024,” Schlosberg added.\n\nRodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “Innovation continues to play a key role in our strategy and globally, our innovation has been well received by our bottlers/distributors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. We are planning to launch Monster Energy® Ultra Vice Guava™ in the United States in October.\n\n“Response to Predator Energy® Gold Strike, launched in April 2024 in selected provinces in China, has been positive and plans are underway to continue its rollout into more markets in China later this year and in 2025.\n\n“The Beast Unleashed® is now available in all 50 states. Nasty Beast™, our new hard tea line is now available in 49 states. We are currently launching a second variety pack of the Beast Unleashed® in a 12-pack of slim 12-oz cans, comprising of Mean Green, Pink Poison, Gnarly Grape and Killer Sunrise.\n\n“Our innovation pipeline for both our non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages remains robust,” Sacks said.\n\n**2024 Six-Months Results** Net sales for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 increased 6.9 percent to $3.80 billion, from $3.55 billion in the comparable period last year. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $132.0 million on net sales for the six-months ended June 30, 2024. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 10.6 percent in the six-months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 was 53.9 percent, compared with 52.7 percent in the comparable period last year.\n\nOperating expenses for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 were $977.5 million, compared with $863.2 million in the comparable period last year.\n\nOperating income for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 increased to $1.07 billion, from $1.01 billion in the comparable period last year.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 was 23.2 percent, compared with 21.7 percent in the comparable period last year. \n\nNet income for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 increased 6.9 percent to $867.4 million, from $811.3 million in the comparable period last year.

Monster has been informed by the depositary that the final proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 47.18%. The depositary will promptly pay for all the shares accepted for purchase pursuant to the tender offer and will return all other shares tendered and not purchased.\n\nRodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, who are Monster’s Co-CEOs and members of the Board of Directors, tendered 608,114 and 350,000 shares, respectively, that they beneficially own. Of these shares, 286,918 and 165,135, respectively, were accepted for purchase by Monster in the tender offer.\n\nSterling Trustees LLC, which controls certain trusts and entities for the benefit of certain family members of Messrs. Sacks and Schlosberg, tendered 8,450,000 shares on behalf of such trusts and entities. Of these shares, 3,986,853 were accepted for purchase by Monster in the tender offer.\n\nMonster may purchase additional shares in the future in the open market subject to market conditions, or in private transactions, exchange offers, tender offers or otherwise. Under applicable securities laws, however, Monster may not repurchase any shares until June 21, 2024. Whether Monster makes additional repurchases in the future will depend on many factors, including the market price of the shares, Monster’s business and financial condition and general economic and market conditions.\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as dealer managers for the tender offer. D.F. King served as the information agent, and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC acted as the depositary. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to Evercore Group L.L.C. at (888) 474-0200 or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (877) 371-5947.\n\n**Monster Beverage Corporation**\n\nBased in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business except through its consolidated subsidiaries.

The tender offer commenced on May 8, 2024, and will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Monster.\n\nOn May 22, 2024, Monster and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement providing for a new $750 million three-year delayed draw senior term loan A facility (the “Term Loan”) and a new $750.0 million five-year senior revolving credit facility (the “RCF”). The tender offer was originally conditioned on entry into the credit agreement and at least $1.0 billion in the aggregate being funded under the Term Loan and the RCF at least five business days prior to the expiration of the tender offer (the “Financing Condition”). Monster intends to borrow an aggregate of $750.0 million under the credit agreement, and expects to use $2.25 billion in cash on hand, to consummate the tender offer. Because Monster expects to use less than $1.0 billion in debt financing to consummate the tender offer, Monster waives the Financing Condition and the tender offer is no longer subject to the Financing Condition.\n\nSterling Trustees LLC, which controls trusts and entities for the benefit of certain family members of Monster’s co-CEOs Messrs. Sacks and Schlosberg, has advised Monster that it currently intends to tender up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares on behalf of such trusts and entities, as purchase price tenders, subject to market conditions. Hilton Schlosberg, one of Monster’s co-CEOs and a member of the Board of Directors, has advised Monster that he currently intends to tender up to 350,000 shares that he beneficially owns, as purchase price tenders, subject to market conditions. Rodney Sacks, Monster’s other co-CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, has advised Monster that he currently intends to tender up to 610,000 shares that he beneficially owns, as purchase price tenders, subject to market conditions.\n\nThe tender offer is only being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 8, 2024 (the “Offer to Purchase”), the related Letter of Transmittal, dated May 8, 2024 (the “Letter of Transmittal”), and certain other materials related thereto, as each may be amended and supplemented from time to time.\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as dealer managers for the tender offer. D.F. King & Co., Inc. is serving as the information agent, and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC is acting as the depositary. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and the other tender offer materials were filed with the SEC, and shareholders may obtain free copies of these documents from the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Shareholders should read these materials carefully because they contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the tender offer. Requests for documents may also be directed to D.F. King & Co., Inc. at (888) 605-1958 or MNST@dfking.com. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to Evercore Group L.L.C. at (888) 474-0200 or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (877) 371-5947.\n\nAlthough Monster has authorized the tender offer, none of the Board of Directors, Monster, the dealer managers, the information agent or the depositary or any of their affiliates has made, and they are not making, any recommendation to shareholders as to whether shareholders should tender or refrain from tendering their shares or as to the price or prices at which shareholders may choose to tender their shares. Monster has not authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Shareholders must make their own decision as to whether to tender their shares and, if so, how many shares to tender and the price or prices at which they will tender the shares. In doing so, shareholders should read carefully the information in, or incorporated by reference in, the Offer to Purchase and in the Letter of Transmittal, including the purpose and effects of the tender offer. Shareholders are urged to discuss their decision with their own tax advisors, financial advisors and/or brokers.\n\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security. No offer, solicitation or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful, save as in compliance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4(f)(8) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n**Monster Beverage Corporation**\n\nBased in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business except through its consolidated subsidiaries.

The tender offer begins today, May 8, 2024, and will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Monster. The tender offer will be funded using a combination of (1) $2.0 billion of cash on hand, (2) $750.0 million in borrowings under a new term loan, and (3) $250.0 million in borrowings under a new revolving credit facility. Monster and certain of its subsidiaries expect to enter into a new credit agreement providing for a new $750 million three-year delayed draw senior term loan A facility (the “Term Loan”) and a new $750.0 million five-year senior revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) at least five business days prior to the expiration of the tender offer. It is a condition to the consummation of the tender offer that the credit agreement is entered into and at least $1.0 billion is funded under the Term Loan and the RCF at least five business days prior to the expiration of the tender offer (the “Financing Condition”). If the Financing Condition is not satisfied and Monster does not waive the Financing Condition, Monster may amend, terminate or extend the tender offer.\n\nMonster shareholders may tender all or a portion of their shares at a price specified by the tendering shareholder of not less than $53.00 nor greater than $60.00 per share in increments of $0.50. Alternatively, Monster shareholders may tender shares without specifying a purchase price, in which case their shares will be purchased at the purchase price determined in accordance with the tender offer. When the tender offer expires, Monster will determine the lowest price per share within the range specified above that will enable it to purchase the maximum number of shares of its common stock having an aggregate purchase price up to $3.0 billion. All shares accepted in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price, which may be higher or lower than the market price immediately prior to or during the tender offer. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, then shares of common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $3.0 billion will be purchased, which would represent approximately between 4.8% to 5.4% of Monster’s issued and outstanding shares as of April 22, 2024, depending on the purchase price payable in the tender offer. In addition, if shares valued at more than the maximum aggregate purchase price of up to $3.0 billion are tendered in the tender offer at or below the purchase price, Monster may accept for purchase at the purchase price pursuant to the tender offer up to an additional 2% of its outstanding shares without extending the expiration time of the tender offer.\n\nThe tender offer is being made outside of Monster’s existing stock repurchase programs. The tender offer provides all Monster shareholders, including Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Monster’s Co-CEOs, with the opportunity to obtain liquidity for all or a portion of their shares with less potential disruption than open-market sales or other transactions. Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg have communicated their intent to tender up to 610,000 and 610,000 shares, respectively, for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. In addition, Sterling Trustees LLC, which controls trusts and entities for the benefit of certain family members of Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg, has advised Monster that it intends to tender up to an aggregate of 20,500,000 shares on behalf of such trusts and entities. Mark S. Vidergauz and Mark J. Hall, who are members of the Board, and Thomas J. Kelly and Emelie C. Tirre, who are executive officers, have advised us that they intend to tender up to 20,000, 500,000, 80,000 and 45,000 shares, respectively, that they beneficially own in the Offer. No other directors or executive officers intend to tender any of their shares in the tender offer. The tender of shares by Mr. Sacks, in particular, may provide him some flexibility to consider his own potential options, which may also help Monster continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. In this regard, after consultation with the Board, Mr. Sacks is considering reducing his day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of Monster's business for which he has always been responsible. At that time, Mr. Sacks intends to remain Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Schlosberg would segue from Co-CEO to CEO.\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as dealer managers for the tender offer. D.F. King & Co., Inc. is serving as the information agent, and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC is acting as the depositary. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and the other tender offer materials will be sent to Monster shareholders shortly after commencement of the tender offer. Each of these documents is also being filed with the SEC, and shareholders may obtain free copies of these documents from the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Shareholders should read these materials carefully when they become available because they will contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the tender offer. Requests for documents may also be directed to D.F. King & Co., Inc. at (888) 605-1958 or MNST@dfking.com. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to Evercore Group L.L.C. at (888) 474-0200 or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (877) 371-5947.\n\nAlthough Monster has authorized the tender offer, none of the Board, Monster, the dealer managers, the information agent or the depositary or any of their affiliates has made, and they are not making, any recommendation to shareholders as to whether shareholders should tender or refrain from tendering their shares or as to the price or prices at which shareholders may choose to tender their shares. Monster has not authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Shareholders must make their own decision as to whether to tender their shares and, if so, how many shares to tender and the price or prices at which they will tender the shares. In doing so, shareholders should read carefully the information in, or incorporated by reference in, the Offer to Purchase and in the Letter of Transmittal, including the purpose and effects of the tender offer. Shareholders are urged to discuss their decision with their own tax advisors, financial advisors and/or brokers.\n\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security. No offer, solicitation or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful, save as in compliance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4(f)(8) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The tender offer is only being made pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Purchase.\n\n**Monster Beverage Corporation**\n\nBased in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business except through its consolidated subsidiaries.

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 first quarter of $64.4 million ($50.4 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 15.6 percent in the 2024 first quarter (12.6 percent exclusive of Argentina’s impact). The difference between reported net sales and net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis was largely due to the impact of inflation related local currency price increases in Argentina, as well as the significant decrease in the Argentine Peso relative to the U.S. Dollar.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks, Bang Energy® drinks and Monster Tour Water®, increased 10.7 percent to $1.73 billion for the 2024 first quarter, from $1.56 billion for the 2023 first quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $54.6 million for the 2024 first quarter ($50.4 million related to Argentina). Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased 14.2 percent in the 2024 first quarter (11.0 percent exclusive of Argentina’s impact).\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands Predator® and Fury®, increased 25.6 percent to $108.4 million for the 2024 first quarter, from $86.4 million in the 2023 first quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $9.8 million for the 2024 first quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Strategic Brands segment increased 36.9 percent in the 2024 first quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of The Beast Unleashed®, Nasty Beast™ Hard Tea, as well as various craft beers and hard seltzers, increased 21.1 percent to $56.1 million for the 2024 first quarter, from $46.3 million in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Other segment, which primarily includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), increased 19.9 percent to $5.5 million for the 2024 first quarter, from $4.6 million in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 19.5 percent to $744.1 million in the 2024 first quarter, from $622.9 million in the 2023 first quarter. Such sales were approximately 39 percent of total net sales in the 2024 first quarter, compared with 37 percent in the 2023 first quarter. Net sales to customers outside the United States, on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 29.8 percent in the 2024 first quarter (21.7 percent exclusive of Argentina’s impact).\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter was 54.1 percent, compared with 52.8 percent in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower input costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix. \n\nOperating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $485.1 million, compared with $412.8 million in the 2023 first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter were 25.5 percent, compared with 24.3 percent in the 2023 first quarter. \n\nDistribution expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $94.4 million, or 5.0 percent of net sales, compared with $76.3 million, or 4.5 percent of net sales, in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nSelling expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $174.4 million, or 9.2 percent of net sales, compared with $149.0 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales, in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $216.3 million, or 11.4 percent of net sales, compared with $187.4 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, for the 2023 first quarter. Stock-based compensation was $22.5 million for the 2024 first quarter, compared with $16.1 million in the 2023 first quarter. \n\nOperating income for the 2024 first quarter was $542.0 million, compared with $485.1 million in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the 2024 first quarter was 23.5 percent, compared with 20.1 percent in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction in the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter.\n\nNet income for the 2024 first quarter increased 11.2 percent to $442.0 million, from $397.4 million in the 2023 first quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2024 first quarter increased 12.0 percent to $0.42, from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to see growth in the energy drink market globally. In the United States, energy is the only segment of the beverage category currently showing unit growth. We continue to grow our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels.\n\n“We achieved another quarter of solid revenue growth, with record first quarter sales. The quarter was again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets.\n\n“We are pleased to report gross profit margin improvement in the first quarter, which increased significantly when compared to the 2023 first quarter. This improvement was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower input costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix,” Schlosberg said.\n\nRodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “Innovation continues to play an important role in our strategy and contributed to our record sales in this quarter. We launched a number of new innovation products in the quarter, including Monster Energy® Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red™, Juice Monster® Rio Punch™ and Java Monster® Irish Créme in the United States.\n\n“Predator Energy®, our affordable energy brand, was launched in the Philippines during the quarter.\n\n“In April 2024, we launched Predator Energy® Gold Strike in a non-carbonated formula in a 500 ml PET bottle, in selected provinces in China. Initial response to this product has been positive.\n\n“The Beast Unleashed® is now available in 49 states and we have commenced with distribution of The Beast Unleashed® in 24 oz. single serve cans in the convenience and gas channel. Nasty Beast™, our new hard tea line was launched in 12 oz. variety packs in January 2024 and in 24 oz. single serve cans in February 2024, and is now available in 49 states. Early response to our hard tea line has been positive.\n\n“Our innovation pipeline for both our non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages remains strong,” Sacks said.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program** During the 2024 first quarter, the Company purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.96 per share, for a total amount of $97.2 million (excluding broker commissions). As of May 2, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs.\n\n**Intention to Commence Tender Offer** The Company intends to commence a modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer for up to $3.0 billion in value of shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions, at a specified price range that is yet to be determined. The Company believes that the tender offer represents an efficient mechanism to permit shareholders the opportunity to obtain liquidity without the potential disruption that can result from market sales.\n\nThe Company expects to fund the tender offer with approximately $2.0 billion of cash on hand and approximately $1.0 billion in combined borrowings, consisting of a new revolving credit facility and a new delayed draw term loan facility, each expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the tender offer. The tender offer will be made outside of the Company’s previously authorized repurchase programs and will allow the Company to retain the ability to purchase additional shares through the previously authorized repurchase programs in the future.\n\nThe Company's Co-CEOs have indicated that they intend to participate in the offer for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. Mr. Sacks' participation, in particular, may provide him some flexibility to consider his own potential options, which may also help the Company continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. In this regard, after consultation with the Company’s Board, Mr. Sacks is considering reducing his day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of the Company's business for which he has always been responsible. At that time, Mr. Sacks intends to remain Chairman of the Company's Board and Mr. Schlosberg would segue from Co-CEO to CEO.\n\n**Investor Conference Call** The Company will host an investor conference call today, May 2, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

For those who are not able to listen to the live broadcast, the call will be archived for approximately one year on the website.\n\n**Monster Beverage Corporation** Based in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business except through its consolidated subsidiaries.

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter of $27.1 million. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 16.1 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks, Bang Energy® drinks and Monster Tour Water®, increased 15.1 percent to $1.60 billion for the 2023 fourth quarter, from $1.39 billion for the 2022 fourth quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $18.8 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased 16.5 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands Predator® and Fury®, decreased 1.3 percent to $91.8 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, from $93.0 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $8.3 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Strategic Brands segment increased 7.7 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of The Beast Unleashed® which was launched in the 2023 first quarter, as well as the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on February 17, 2022, increased 30.6 percent to $35.2 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, from $26.9 million in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nNet sales for the Company’s Other segment, which primarily includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), increased 6.2 percent to $4.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, from $4.6 million in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 17.4 percent to $637.0 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, from $542.5 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Such sales were approximately 37 percent of total net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with 36 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. Net sales to customers outside the United States, on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 22.4 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2 percent, compared with 51.8 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of pricing actions in certain markets, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 fourth quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value (the “Bang Inventory Step-Up”). As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $5.0 million during the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.5 percent for the 2023 fourth quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up.\n\nOperating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $504.4 million, compared with $390.0 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter were 29.2 percent, compared with 25.8 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter included $39.9 million of impairment charges related to the Alcohol Brands segment (the “Alcohol Impairment Charges”), due in part to the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories. The Alcohol Impairment Charges relate to certain non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment acquired as part of the CANarchy transaction. Exclusive of the Alcohol Impairment Charges, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.8 percent for the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nDistribution expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $79.6 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, compared with $76.1 million, or 5.0 percent of net sales, in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nSelling expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $176.8 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales, compared with $145.3 million, or 9.6 percent of net sales, in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $248.0 million, or 14.3 percent of net sales, compared with $168.5 million, or 11.1 percent of net sales, for the 2022 fourth quarter. General and administrative expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter include the Alcohol Impairment Charges. Exclusive of the Alcohol Impairment Charges, general and administrative charges as a percentage of net sales were 12.0 percent for the 2023 fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation was $16.4 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with $14.9 million in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nOperating income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10.0 percent to $434.0 million, from $394.4 million in the 2022 fourth quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in net sales, as well as an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Operating income, adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and Alcohol Impairment Charges, increased 21.4 percent to $478.9 million in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was primarily due to a large increase in the tax benefit related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options.\n\nNet income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 21.6 percent to $367.0 million, from $301.7 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Net income, adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and Alcohol Impairment Charges, net of tax, increased 33.1 percent to $401.5 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 22.3 percent to $0.35, from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and Alcohol Impairment Charges was $0.38 for the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to see sound growth in the energy drink market globally. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue growth, with record sales for our fourth quarter and 2023 financial year. The quarter and the 2023 financial year were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n“Gross profit margins in the quarter improved significantly as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter, primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs. Gross profit margins also improved sequentially from the previous quarters.\n\n“The Bang Energy acquisition has been successfully integrated and is performing according to expectations.”\n\n“Operating expenses for the Alcohol Brands Segment included impairment charges of $39.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, relating to certain acquired non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment, as a result of the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories,” Schlosberg said.\n\nRodney C.

This change will better align the business with Monster Beverage Corporation’s brand equity, particularly as these products are expected to continue to play an increasingly important role in CANarchy’s future activities.\n\n“We entered the alcohol beverage sector with the acquisition of CANarchy in February 2022, providing us with a fully staffed organizational infrastructure, full distribution in place and manufacturing capabilities,” said Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Monster Beverage Corporation. “During the past two years, we integrated CANarchy’s infrastructure to develop, introduce and market new products that are becoming leading brands in the flavored malt beverage space.”\n\n“Monster Brewing Company will continue to function independently under the management of its President, Tony Short, and his team,” added Rodney Sacks, Monster Beverage Corporation’s Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer. “We are pleased that the strategy of combining the strengths of both organizations is proving successful, as we continue to develop and roll out innovative new products in the flavored malt beverages space and beyond. We are particularly proud that The Beast Unleashed was the best-selling new beer brand in 2023.”\n\nTony Short, Monster Brewing Company’s President, said, “Our new corporate identity operating as Monster Brewing Company affords an even greater opportunity to grow, not only with the introduction of innovative new products but also with our well-established core brands, which are cherished by a loyal consumer base.”\n\n**About Monster Brewing Company**Monster Brewing Company, formerly known as CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, was founded in 2015 as a disruptive collective of craft breweries. Among its current portfolio of beer brands are Jai Alai® IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, and Wild Basin® hard seltzers, among others.
