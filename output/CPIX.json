(Nasdaq: CPIX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that its portfolio of FDA-approved brands delivered combined revenues of $9.1 million during the third quarter of 2024. The company ended the third quarter of 2024 with $77 million in total assets, $52 million in liabilities and $25 million of shareholders' equity.\n\n[ ![Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Logo \\(PRNewsFoto/Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/84325/cumberland_pharmaceuticals_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/84325/cumberland_pharmaceuticals_logo.html)\n\n\"With a number of developments and growth opportunities underway at Cumberland, we remain optimistic about our future outlook,\" said A.J. Kazimi, CEO of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. \"As we move into the remainder of the year, our dedicated team will continue in their efforts – working together to provide unique products that improve the quality of patient care.\"\n\n**_RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE:_**\n\n**New Real-World Study Favors Caldolor over ketorolac**\n\nEarlier this week, Cumberland announced the publication of new real-world outcomes research comparing Caldolor to its key competitor – ketorolac.\n\nThis extensive analysis evaluated 17 million patient records and selected over 150,000 adult and pediatric patients who receive either product.\n\nThe results provide compelling evidence that Caldolor is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse drug reactions and also improved healthcare utilization.\n\nCumberland believes these important new findings underscore Caldolor's potential to improve patient care by reducing their treatment complications, while also delivering potential savings for healthcare systems through decreased hospital readmissions and shortened treatment times.\n\n**State Medicaid Coverage for Kristalose ® Grows**\n\nCumberland's prescription-strength laxative, Kristalose, continues to perform best in states where the company has Medicaid coverage, such as Texas, New York and Wisconsin. Cumberland has announced that the product is now also covered on certain Virginia, Louisiana and Maine Medicaid plans.\n\n**New WHO Report Highlights Need for Antibiotics like Vibativ®**\n\nThe  _World Health Organization (\"WHO\")_ issued a new report that found that antimicrobial resistance is becoming an urgent global health and socioeconomic crisis. Further, it noted that the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the effectiveness of many common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. Unlike many antibiotics that are losing the battle to fight bacteria, Vibativ's unique dual method of action was specifically designed to address drug-resistant bacteria, and Cumberland believes it has the potential to help many patients amid the growing antibiotic resistance crisis.\n\n**Expanded Patient Support for Sancuso ®**\n\nDuring the third quarter, Cumberland launched new patient support initiatives for Sancuso, its oncology medication, which broaden access to the product, allowing more patients to try it and experience its benefits. The company introduced a new HUB services capability to provide enhanced, comprehensive patient access and assistance throughout their treatment journey.\n\n**International Partnerships**\n\nIn September 2024, Cumberland's partner for Caldolor in Mexico, PiSA Pharmaceutical – one of the largest established pharmaceutical companies in that country – completed the submission of the approval dossier to Mexico's regulatory agency for the product's approval there.\n\nCumberland also continues to work with its partners in their efforts to register and launch Vibativ in several international markets such as China, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. In fact, Cumberland's partner in the Middle East, Tabuk Pharmaceutical, has obtained the final approvals needed to commercialize Vibativ in Saudi Arabia and has begun ordering the product in preparation for its launch, which is planned for this year.\n\n**Cumberland Emerging Technologies Program Developments**\n\nThrough its work at Cumberland Emerging Technologies, Inc. (\"CET\"), Cumberland continues to build a long-term pipeline of innovative new biopharmaceutical products and has recently shared several new developments.\n\nCET is advancing a new treatment for delirium, a growing neurological condition affecting critical care patients. Results from the Phase II MENDING Trial, conducted with Vanderbilt University Medical Center and funded by the National Institute of Health (\"NIH\"), demonstrate promising outcomes for the treatment's safety and efficacy. The trial's primary safety endpoint – the safety of this new treatment – was met, with the treatment generally well-tolerated among patients. Additionally, findings showed reductions in delirium days, antipsychotic, opioid and sedative use, and coma occurrences, which, while not statistically significant due to the small sample size, were deemed clinically meaningful. CET is now planning to discuss a potential pivotal study with the FDA to further evaluate the proprietary formulation tested in the pilot study.\n\nAdditionally, CET has announced a new product, developed in collaboration with Vanderbilt researchers and initially funded by an NIH small business grant, designed to detect internal bleeding. During the third quarter, CET partnered with a corporate sponsor to fund the remaining development and plan for the commercialization of this biologic. Unlike standard GI hemorrhage diagnostics, which rely on colonoscopy or CT scans that may be ineffective without active bleeding, CET's technology identifies pre-formed blood clots, enabling precise localization of bleeding sites even after bleeding stops. This advancement could streamline diagnosis, reduce healthcare costs and lessen patient strain. Next steps include scaling up supplies, while conducting the additional testing needed to file and obtain clearance for an investigational new drug application, paving the way for an initial patient study.\n\n**Product Pipeline**\n\nCumberland has been evaluating its ifetroban product candidate, a selective thromboxane-prostanoid receptor antagonist, in a series of clinical studies. It has now been dosed in nearly 1,400 subjects and has been found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and various patient populations. The company has three Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating ifetroban in patients with 1) Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, 2) cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare, fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease that results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart, and lung muscles and 3) Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, the most common form of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease. This third program is the company's newest, with enrollment now underway.\n\nThe company has applied for two FDA designations for our Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy product candidate:\n\n1) _Orphan Drug Designation_ , which is granted to products that show promise in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of rare – or orphan – diseases; such designation can result in a number of benefits associated with the FDA review process including exclusivity after approval of the product.\n\n2) _Rare Pediatric Disease Designation_ , which is given to products intended to prevent or treat serious or life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children from birth to 18 years of age. Upon FDA approval, this designation may result in a priority review voucher from the FDA for a different product.\n\nCumberland subsequently was informed by the FDA that both the Orphan Drug Designation and the Rare Pediatric Disease Designation requests for this candidate have been granted.\n\nCumberland expects to close two ifetroban studies this year and will share results from all studies underway before deciding on the best development path for ifetroban, its first new chemical entity, which the company believes has the potential to benefit many patients with orphan diseases that represent unmet medical needs.\n\n**_FINANCIAL RESULTS_**\n\n**Net Revenue:** For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues were $9.1 million.

These financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). The definition of these supplemental measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\n\nBecause these supplemental financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the supplemental financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.\n\nCumberland's management believes these supplemental financial performance measures are important as they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the Company's operating performance. In addition, Cumberland believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure the Company's operating results. Management believes that presenting these supplemental measures provides useful information about the Company's underlying performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that Cumberland does not believe are indicative of its core business performance or reflect long-term strategic activities. Certain of these items are not settled through cash payments and include: depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense and income taxes. Cumberland utilizes its net operating loss carryforwards to pay minimal income taxes. In addition, the use of these financial measures provides greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the evaluation of the Company's operating performance.\n\nThe Company defines these supplemental financial measures as follows:\n\n  * **Adjusted Earnings (loss):** net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation, interest income and interest expense. \n\n\n\n(a) Represents the share-based compensation of Cumberland.\n\n  * **Adjusted Diluted Earnings (loss) Per Share:** Adjusted Earnings (loss) divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL51075&sd=2024-11-07) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cumberland-pharmaceuticals-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-company-update-302299197.html>\n\nSOURCE Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nInvestor Contact: Shayla Simpson, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc., (615) 255-0068, or Media Contact: Molly Aggas, Dalton Agency, (704) 641-6641\n\nCumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. 1600 West End Avenue, Suite 1300, Nashville, Tennessee 37203 \n\n[Site Map](http://www.cumberlandpharma.com/sitemap)[Privacy Policy](http://www.cumberlandpharma.com/privacy-policy)[Terms & Conditions](http://www.cumberlandpharma.com/terms)\n"

(NASDAQ: CPIX)**, a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to Ifetroban for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Cumberland is completing the _[FIGHT DMD™ trial](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296611-1&h=3272968686&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fightdmdtrial.com%2F&a=FIGHT+DMD%E2%84%A2+trial)_ , a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study investigating the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of once daily oral Ifetroban in patients with DMD. Results will be announced later this year.\n\n[ ![Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Logo \\(PRNewsFoto/Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/84325/cumberland_pharmaceuticals_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/84325/cumberland_pharmaceuticals_logo.html)\n\n\"For Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating genetic disorder affecting young boys, securing both Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations for Ifetroban from the FDA is a critical step forward,\" said A.J. Kazimi, chief executive officer of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. \"These designations not only recognize the urgent need for effective treatments but also provide vital support to accelerate research and development. These important regulatory milestones represent hope for families and a pathway to bring transformative medicines to a vulnerable patient population more quickly and efficiently.\"\n\nThe U.S. FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to incentivize drug development for life-threatening diseases affecting less than 200,000 children in the U.S. As these diseases pose unique challenges to drug development, special focus is needed to provide therapeutic options to these children. Companies that receive approval for a drug or biologic with this designation may be eligible for a voucher which may be redeemed for priority review of a different product. Additionally, this voucher may be transferred or sold to another sponsor. \n\nOrphan Drug Designation is granted by the U.S. FDA to encourage development of new therapies for rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. This designation offers sponsors multiple incentives, which include exemption from user fees, tax credits for qualified clinical trials and potential market exclusivity for seven years following approval of the product.\n\n**_About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy_**\n\nDMD is a rare and fatal genetic disorder which affects about 1 in every 3,300 male births worldwide. Characterized by mutations in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin, DMD causes damage to the skeletal and cardiac muscle of DMD patients, with cardiomyopathy recognized as the primary cause of death. Ifetroban is being evaluated to treat the heart disease associated with DMD, which has received limited attention with current therapies.\n\n**_About Ifetroban_**\n\nIfetroban is a potent and selective thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TPr) antagonist. Ifetroban exhibits high affinity for TPr on many cell types including cardiomyocytes, platelets, vascular and airway smooth muscle, and fibroblasts, and lacks agonistic activity. In several preclinical models of muscular dystrophy, including limb-girdle and Duchenne, ifetroban prevented cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction and improved mortality.\n\nCumberland previously announced the acquisition of the ifetroban program in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Cumberland Emerging Technologies.\n\nCumberland is also evaluating ifetroban for systemic sclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis. The ongoing _[FIGHTING FIBROSIS Trial](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296611-1&h=3133358607&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fightingfibrosistrial.com%2F&a=FIGHTING+FIBROSIS+Trial)_ is a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled Phase II study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive interstitial lung disease. IPF is marked by inflammation and fibrosis of the lungs, resulting in rapidly declining lung function and reduced survival within five years of diagnosis.
