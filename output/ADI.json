(Nasdaq: ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, which ended November 2, 2024.\n\n[ ![Analog Devices, Inc. \\(PRNewsfoto/Analog Devices, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2379028/ADI_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2379028/ADI_Logo.html)\n\n\"ADI's revenue, profitability, and earnings per share all finished above our guided midpoint, underscoring continued business momentum and solid execution,\" said Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair. \"While unprecedented customer inventory headwinds drove a historic revenue decline during fiscal 2024, we maintained operating margins north of 40%, which is a testament to our business model's resilience. We also continued to make strategic, long-term investments across engineering, manufacturing, and the end-to-end customer experience. As such, we enter 2025 as an even stronger enterprise, giving me the utmost confidence in our ability to drive increased value for customers and shareholders over the long term.\"\n\n\"After a brief decline in overall bookings during our third quarter, orders picked up steadily throughout the fourth quarter, particularly in the Automotive end market. While macro uncertainty continues to limit the pace of our recovery, we remain cautiously optimistic for a strong growth year in fiscal 2025,\" said Richard Puccio, CFO.\n\n**_Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024_**\n\n**_Results Summary_(1)**  \n---  \n_(in millions, except per-share amounts and percentages)_  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Twelve Months Ended**  \n**Nov. 2 , 2024** |  **Oct. 28 , 2023** |  **Change** |  **Nov. 2 , 2024** |  **Oct. 28 , 2023** |  **Change**  \nRevenue |  $ 2,443 |  $ 2,716 |  (10) % |  $ 9,427 |  $ 12,306 |  (23) %  \nGross margin |  $ 1,416 |  $ 1,647 |  (14) % |  $ 5,381 |  $ 7,877 |  (32) %  \nGross margin percentage |  58.0 % |  60.6 % |  (260 bps) |  57.1 % |  64.0 % |  (690 bps)  \nOperating income |  $ 569 |  $ 634 |  (10) % |  $ 2,033 |  $ 3,823 |  (47) %  \nOperating margin  |  23.3 % |  23.4 % |  (10 bps) |  21.6 % |  31.1 % |  (950 bps)  \nDiluted earnings per share |  $ 0.96 |  $ 1.00 |  (4) % |  $ 3.28 |  $ 6.55 |  (50) %  \n**_Adjusted Results_(2)**  \nAdjusted gross margin |  $ 1,660 |  $ 1,907 |  (13) % |  $ 6,404 |  $ 8,925 |  (28) %  \nAdjusted gross margin percentage |  67.9 % |  70.2 % |  (230 bps) |  67.9 % |  72.5 % |  (460 bps)  \nAdjusted operating income |  $ 1,005 |  $ 1,215 |  (17) % |  $ 3,853 |  $ 6,014 |  (36) %  \nAdjusted operating margin |  41.1 % |  44.7 % |  (360 bps) |  40.9 % |  48.9 % |  (800 bps)  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share |  $ 1.67 |  $ 2.01 |  (17) % |  $ 6.38 |  $ 10.09 |  (37) %  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Trailing Twelve Months**  \n**_Cash Generation_** |  **Nov. 2, 2024** |  **Nov. 2, 2024**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities |  $ 1,051 |  $ 3,853  \n% of revenue |  43 % |  41 %  \nCapital expenditures |  $ (165) |  $ (730)  \nFree cash flow(2) |  $ 885 |  $ 3,122  \n% of revenue |  36 % |  33 %  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Trailing Twelve Months**  \n**_Cash Return_** |  **Nov. 2, 2024** |  **Nov. 2, 2024**  \nDividend paid |  $ (457) |  $ (1,795)  \nStock repurchases |  (95) |  (616)  \nTotal cash returned |  $ (552) |  $ (2,411)  \n(1) The sum and/or computation of the individual amounts may not equal the total due to rounding.  \n(2) Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this press release. See also the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section for additional information.  \n  \n**_Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025_**\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we are forecasting revenue of $2.35 billion, +/- $100 million. At the midpoint of this revenue outlook, we expect reported operating margin of approximately 22.0%, +/- 130 bps, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 40.0%, +/- 100 bps. We are planning for reported EPS to be $0.80, +/- $0.10, and adjusted EPS to be $1.53, +/- $0.10. \n\nOur first quarter fiscal 2025 outlook is based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\n\nThe adjusted results and adjusted anticipated results above are financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this release. See also the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section for additional information.\n\n**_Dividend Payment_**\n\nThe ADI Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.92 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 20, 2024 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2024.\n\n**_Conference Call Scheduled for Today, Tuesday, November 26, 2024 at 10:00 am ET_**\n\nADI will host a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 10:00 am ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at [investor.analog.com](http://investor.analog.com).\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Information_**\n\nThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this release.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company's core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company's earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's core business. Management also believes that free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure, is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.\n\nAdjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain _acquisition related expenses 1_, which are described further below. Adjusted gross margin percentage represents adjusted gross margin divided by revenue.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain _acquisition related expenses 1_, _acquisition related transaction costs 2_, and _special charges, net 3_, which are described further below. Adjusted operating expenses percentage represents adjusted operating expenses divided by revenue.\n\nAdjusted operating income is defined as operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: _acquisition related expenses 1_, _acquisition related transaction costs 2_, and _special charges, net 3_, which are described further below. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by revenue.\n\nAdjusted nonoperating expense (income) is defined as nonoperating expense (income), determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain _acquisition related expenses 1_, which is described further below.\n\nAdjusted income before income taxes is defined as income before income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: _acquisition related expenses 1_, _acquisition related transaction costs 2_, and s _pecial charges, net 3_, which are described further below.\n\nAdjusted provision for income taxes is defined as provision for income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding _tax related items 4_, which are described further below. Adjusted tax rate represents adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes. \n\nAdjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: _acquisition related expenses 1_, _acquisition related transaction costs 2_,_special charges, net 3_, and _tax related items 4_, which are described further below. \n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net. Free cash flow revenue percentage represents free cash flow divided by revenue. \n\n_1 Acquisition Related Expenses_: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to debt, inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include fair value adjustments associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\n\n_2 Acquisition Related Transaction Costs_: Costs directly related to the Maxim acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\n\n_3 Special Charges, net_: Expenses, net, incurred as part of the integration of Maxim, in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, other accelerated stock-based compensation expense and other cost reduction efforts or reorganizational initiatives. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.\n\n_4 Tax Related Items_: Income tax effect of the non-GAAP items discussed above, an income tax benefit from a discrete tax item related to a federal corporate income tax relief claim and certain other income tax benefits associated with prior periods. We excluded the income tax effect of these tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.\n\n**_About Analog Devices, Inc._**\n\nAnalog Devices, Inc.

including the technical characteristics of the product, the \"sold to\" customer information, the \"ship to\" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**Nov. 2, 2024** |  **Oct. 28, 2023**

(Nasdaq: [ADI](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4269632-1&h=4197400941&u=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fquote%2FADI%2F%3Fltr%3D1&a=ADI)), a global semiconductor leader, today launched a suite of developer-centric offerings that unite cross-device, cross-market hardware, software and services to help customers deliver innovations for the Intelligent Edge with enhanced speed and security. Central to this launch is CodeFusion Studio™, a new, comprehensive embedded software development environment based on Microsoft's Visual Studio code. This environment is ADI's first-ever fully integrated suite of software and security solutions. CodeFusion Studio™ leverages a modern integrated development environment (IDE) and command-line interface, which incorporates open-source configuration and profiling tools to simplify development on heterogeneous processors and drive efficiencies.\n\nCodeFusion Studio™ is available today for download on ADI's new Developer Portal ([developer.analog.com](http://developer.analog.com)) – a comprehensive resource hub, offering extensive documentation, support, partnerships and community engagement. CodeFusion Studio™ also supports the ADI Assure™ Trusted Edge Security Architecture, the company's universal hardware and software security foundation, which provides a simple and flexible way to natively implement security in Intelligent Edge devices. Together, CodeFusion Studio™, ADI Assure™ and the ADI Developer portal provide customers with the tools and resources they need to help bring products to market more quickly with enhanced security and reliability. By accelerating deployment times, customers can quickly capitalize on the full value of the Intelligent Edge, which can lead to better business decisions, improved customer satisfaction, enhanced insights and overall business growth.\n\n\"The complexity of embedded development at the edge is growing, demanding expertise in hardware, software, and security simultaneously,\" said Gregory Bryant, president of Global Business Units at ADI. \"We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide deep expertise in integration and vertical technologies across diverse markets, making innovation faster, easier and more cost-effective. That's why we are investing heavily in developing and launching these solutions, with plans to continue, enabling our customers to confidently innovate for the Intelligent Edge.\"\n\n**About CodeFusion Studio™:** Built on open-source solutions, CodeFusion Studio™ supports a variety of hardware, including select ADI microcontrollers with more digital solutions to come in subsequent versions of the product. It encompasses an IDE, software development kits (SDK), as well as configuration and productivity tools. The experience was created specifically for developers to provide the abstractions they need to simplify development on heterogeneous processors and drive efficiencies. Through its strong partnerships with customers, ADI has identified that nearly half of the product development cycle is spent on debugging and deployment readiness. With the introduction of CodeFusion Studio™, ADI anticipates significantly reducing the time required for these tasks, leading to faster time-to-market and substantial cost savings.\n\n**About ADI Assure™:** The Intelligent Edge continually evolves in features and functionality, but this comes with increased cybersecurity exposure and new regulatory requirements. The ADI Assure™ brand represents ADI's commitment to integrating security natively at the Intelligent Edge. The ADI Assure™ Trusted Edge Security Architecture is the first pillar of this brand; it includes hardware security capabilities within select ADI hardware products, and software layers with application programming interfaces (APIs) available within Code Fusion Studio™. Initially supporting the MAX32690 microcontroller, these security APIs will remain consistent across an expanding range of ADI processing platforms, easing the migration of software, while providing flexibility and scalability to meet the resource requirements and the interoperability needs of the application.\n\nBy simplifying the implementation of typical security use cases and enabling security early in the design cycle, the ADI Assure™ Trusted Edge Security Architecture helps reduce customer time-to-market for new product designs and help meet the \"secure-by-design\" goals.\n\n**About ADI's Developer Portal and commitment to open-source:** The offerings above combine with ADI's Developer Portal to provide developers with the resources they need including robust documentation, support, partnership and community. Additionally, ADI has a long history of supporting open-source projects and the company is expanding its involvement in the open-source community to create better, more accessible solutions that can easily integrate with third-party solutions. This will allow current and future customers to work at the level of abstraction they prefer and leverage advancements at the Intelligent Edge.\n\nFor more information, please visit [ADI's Software & Security Newsroom](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4269632-1&h=1350316126&u=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper-dev.analog.com%2Fnewsroom&a=ADI%27s+Software+%26+Security+Newsroom)[.](https://developer.analog.com/newsroom)\n\n[**About Analog Devices**](https://developer.analog.com/newsroom)[Analog Devices, Inc.
