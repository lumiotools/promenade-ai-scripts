NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Mammoth defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, gains on disposal of assets, net, impairment of goodwill, stock based compensation, interest expense and financing charges, net, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of interest on trade accounts receivable and certain legal expenses) and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further adjusted to add back interest on trade accounts receivable. The Company excludes the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the energy service industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Mammoth's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets. Mammoth's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure its ability to meet debt service requirements.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net (loss) income on a consolidated basis and for each of the Company's segments (in

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Mammoth defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, gains on disposal of assets, net, impairment of goodwill, stock based compensation, interest expense and financing charges, net, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of interest on trade accounts receivable and certain legal expenses) and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further adjusted to add back interest on trade accounts receivable. The Company excludes the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the energy service industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Mammoth's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets. Mammoth's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure its ability to meet debt service requirements.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net (loss) income on a consolidated basis and for each of the Company's segments (in thousands):\n\n**Consolidated**\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**Reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA:** |

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before\ndepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, gains on disposal of assets, net, impairment of goodwill, stock-based\ncompensation, interest expense and financing charges, net, other income or expense, net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further\nadjusted to include interest on trade accounts receivable. We exclude the items listed above from net income or loss in arriving at Adjusted\nEBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods\nand book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered\nas an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with\nGAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components\nin understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the\nhistoric costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be\ncomparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating\nperformance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nAPRIL 2021 15\nAppendix: Well Completion Services Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial\nstatements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.

More importantly, we were pleased to have recently received a total of $168.4 million of the $188.4 million owed to our subsidiary through the Settlement Agreement with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA. We are now debt free and have plans to invest in both our Infrastructure Services and Well Completion Services divisions over the next year. In Infrastructure Services, we will be investing in additional crews and our engineering services capabilities to better serve our customers. In our Well Completion Services division, we will be upgrading pressure pumping equipment to more efficient dual fuel Tier 4 technology. We believe this investment positions us to capitalize on rising demand as markets are anticipated to improve later next year. Now that we are debt free and have significant capital to invest into our businesses, we believe we have an excellent platform to increase shareholder value.\"\n\n**Financial Overview for the Third Quarter 2024:** Total revenue was $40.0 million for the third quarter compared to $65.0 million for the same quarter last year.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter was $24.0 million, or $0.50 loss per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.02 loss per diluted share, for the same quarter last year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) was ($6.4) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.4 million for the same quarter last year.\n\n**Well Completion Services** Mammoth's well completion services division contributed revenue (inclusive of inter-segment revenue) of $2.2 million for the third quarter, compared to $20.3 million for the same quarter of 2023.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Mammoth defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, gains on disposal of assets, net, impairment of goodwill, stock based compensation, interest expense and financing charges, net, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of interest on trade accounts receivable and certain legal expenses) and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further adjusted to add back interest on trade accounts receivable. The Company excludes the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the energy service industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Mammoth's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets. Mammoth's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure its ability to meet debt service requirements.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net (loss) income on a consolidated basis and for each of the Company's segments (in

A blowout may consist of salt water, oil,\nnatural gas or a mixture of these. Blowouts can occur in all types of exploration and production operations, not just during drilling operations. If\nreservoir fluids flow into another formation and do not flow to the surface, the result is called an underground blowout. If the well experiencing a\nblowout has significant open-hole intervals, it is possible that the well will bridge over (or seal itself with rock fragments from collapsing formations)\ndown-hole and intervention efforts will be averted.\nBottomhole assembly The lower portion of the drillstring, consisting of (from the bottom up in a vertical well) the bit, bit sub, a mud motor (in certain cases), stabilizers, drill\ncollar, heavy-weight drillpipe, jarring devices (“jars”) and crossovers for various threadforms. The bottomhole assembly must provide force for the bit\nto break the rock (weight on bit), survive a hostile mechanical environment and provide the driller with directional control of the well. Oftentimes the\nassembly includes a mud motor, directional drilling and measuring equipment, measurements-while-drilling tools, logging-while-drilling tools and\nother specialized devices.\nCementing To prepare and pump cement into place in a wellbore.\nCoiled tubing A long, continuous length of pipe wound on a spool. The pipe is straightened prior to pushing into a wellbore and rewound to coil the pipe back onto\nthe transport and storage spool. Depending on the pipe diameter (1 in. to 4 1/2 in.) and the spool size, coiled tubing can range from 2,000 ft. to 23,000\nft. (610 m to 6,096 m) or greater length.\nCompletion A generic term used to describe the assembly of down-hole tubulars and equipment required to enable safe and efficient production from an oil or gas\nwell. The point at which the completion process begins may depend on the type and design of the well.\nDirectional drilling The intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take. This is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly\n(BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken\ndown-hole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components and drill bits, including rotary steerable systems, and drill bits. The directional\ndriller also exploits drilling parameters such as weight on bit and rotary speed to deflect the bit away from the axis of the existing wellbore. In some\ncases, such as drilling steeply dipping formations or unpredictable deviation in conventional drilling operations, directional-drilling techniques may be\nemployed to ensure that the hole is drilled vertically. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: point the bit in the\ndirection that one wants to drill. The most common way is through the use of a bend near the bit in a down-hole steerable mud motor. The bend points\nthe bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit\nturns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that\ndirection may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) so that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the\nwellbore axis, but instead sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating,\nusually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes.\nDown-hole Pertaining to or in the wellbore (as opposed to being on the surface).\nDown-hole motor A drilling motor located in the drill string above the drilling bit powered by the flow of drilling mud. Down-hole motors are used to increase the speed\nand efficiency of the drill bit or can be used to steer the bit in directional drilling operations. Drilling motors have become very popular because of\nhorizontal and directional drilling applications and the day rates for drilling rigs.\nDrilling rig The machine used to drill a wellbore.\nDrillpipe or Drill pipe Tubular steel conduit fitted with special threaded ends called tool joints. The drillpipe connects the rig surface equipment with the bottomhole\nassembly and the bit, both to pump drilling fluid to the bit and to be able to raise, lower and rotate the bottomhole assembly and bit.\nDrillstring or Drill string The combination of the drillpipe, the bottomhole assembly and any other tools used to make the drill bit turn at the bottom of the wellbore.\nFlowback The process of allowing fluids to flow from the well following a treatment, either in preparation for a subsequent phase of treatment or in preparation\nfor cleanup and returning the well to production.\nHorizontal drilling A subset of the more general term “directional drilling,” used where the departure of the wellbore from vertical exceeds about 80 degrees. Note that\nsome horizontal wells are designed such that after reaching true 90-degree horizontal, the wellbore may actually start drilling upward. In such cases,\nthe angle past 90 degrees is continued, as in 95 degrees, rather than reporting it as deviation from vertical, which would then be 85 degrees. Because a\nhorizontal well typically penetrates a greater length of the reservoir, it can offer significant production improvement over a vertical well.\nHydraulic fracturing A stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high\npressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in\nopposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the\ntreatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large\narea of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.\nHydrocarbon A naturally occurring organic compound comprising hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons can be as simple as methane, but many are highly complex\nmolecules, and can occur as gases, liquids or solids. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. The most common hydrocarbons are natural gas,\noil and coal.\ni\nMesh size The size of the proppant that is determined by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired size of\nthe proppant. Each type of proppant comes in various sizes, categorized as mesh sizes, and the various mesh sizes are used in different\napplications in the oil and natural gas industry. The mesh number system is a measure of the number of equally sized openings per square inch of\nscreen through which the proppant is sieved.\nMud motors A positive displacement drilling motor that uses hydraulic horsepower of the drilling fluid to drive the drill bit. Mud motors are used extensively\nin directional drilling operations.\nNatural gas liquids Components of natural gas that are liquid at surface in field facilities or in gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids can be classified according\nto their vapor pressures as low (condensate), intermediate (natural gasoline) and high (liquefied petroleum gas) vapor pressure.\nNitrogen pumping unit A high-pressure pump or compressor unit capable of delivering high-purity nitrogen gas for use in oil or gas wells. Two basic types of units are\ncommonly available: a nitrogen converter unit that pumps liquid nitrogen at high pressure through a heat exchanger or converter to deliver high-\npressure gas at ambient temperature, and a nitrogen generator unit that compresses and separates air to provide a supply of high pressure nitrogen\ngas.\nPlugging The process of permanently closing oil and gas wells no longer capable of producing in economic quantities. Plugging work can be performed\nwith a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment; however, this service is typically provided by companies that specialize\nin plugging work.\nPlug A down-hole packer assembly used in a well to seal off or isolate a particular formation for testing, acidizing, cementing, etc.; also a type of plug\nused to seal off a well temporarily while the wellhead is removed.\nPounds per square inch A unit of pressure. It is the pressure resulting from a one pound force applied to an area of one square inch.\nPressure pumping Services that include the pumping of liquids under pressure.\nProducing formation An underground rock formation from which oil, natural gas or water is produced. Any porous rock will contain fluids of some sort, and all rocks\nat considerable distance below the Earth’s surface will initially be under pressure, often related to the hydrostatic column of ground waters\nabove the reservoir. To produce, rocks must also have permeability, or the capacity to permit fluids to flow through them.\nProppant Sized particles mixed with fracturing fluid to hold fractures open after a hydraulic fracturing treatment. In addition to naturally occurring sand\ngrains, man-made or specially engineered proppants, such as resin-coated sand or high-strength ceramic materials like sintered bauxite, may also\nbe used. Proppant materials are carefully sorted for size and sphericity to provide an efficient conduit for production of fluid from the reservoir\nto the wellbore.\nResource play Accumulation of hydrocarbons known to exist over a large area.\nShale A fine-grained, fissile, sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers.\nTight oil Conventional oil that is found within reservoirs with very low permeability. The oil contained within these reservoir rocks typically will not\nflow to the wellbore at economic rates without assistance from technologically advanced drilling and completion processes. Commonly,\nhorizontal drilling coupled with multistage fracturing is used to access these difficult to produce reservoirs.\nTight sands A type of unconventional tight reservoir. Tight reservoirs are those which have low permeability, often quantified as less than 0.1 millidarcies.\nTubulars A generic term pertaining to any type of oilfield pipe, such as drill pipe, drill collars, pup joints, casing, production tubing and pipeline.\nUnconventional resource/unconventional well A term for the different manner by which resources are exploited as compared to the extraction of conventional resources. In unconventional\ndrilling, the wellbore is generally drilled to specific objectives within narrow parameters, often across long, lateral intervals within narrow\nhorizontal formations offering greater contact area with the producing formation. Typically, the well is then hydraulically fractured at multiple\nstages to optimize production.\nWellbore The physical conduit from surface into the hydrocarbon reservoir.\nWell stimulation A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing\ntreatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly\nconductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and\ngenerally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near wellbore area. Stimulation in shale gas\nreservoirs typically takes the form of hydraulic fracturing treatments.\nWireline A general term used to describe well-intervention operations conducted using single-strand or multi-strand wire or cable for intervention in oil or\ngas wells. Although applied inconsistently, the term commonly is used in association with electric logging and cables incorporating electrical\nconductors.\nWorkover The process of performing major maintenance or remedial treatments on an oil or gas well. In many cases, workover implies the removal and\nreplacement of the production tubing string after the well has been killed and a workover rig has been placed on location. Through-tubing\nworkover operations, using coiled tubing, snubbing or slickline equipment, are routinely conducted to complete treatments or well service\nactivities that avoid a full workover where the tubing is removed. This operation saves considerable time and expense.\nii\nThe following is a glossary of certain electrical infrastructure industry terms used in this report:\nDistribution The distribution of electricity from the transmission system to individual customers.\nSubstation A part of an electrical transmission and distribution system that transforms voltage from high to low, or the reverse.\nTransmission The movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electric substation.\niii\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nVarious statements contained in this report that express a belief, expectation, or intention, or that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act and the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Business\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented energy services company focused on providing products and services to enable the exploration and development of North American\nonshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserve as well as the construction and repair of the electric grid for private utilities, public investor-owned utilities and co-operative\nutilities through our infrastructure services businesses. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic growth\nopportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes well completion services, infrastructure services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other\nservices. Our well completion services division provides hydraulic fracturing, sand hauling and water transfer services. Our infrastructure services division provides engineering,\ndesign, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells\nnatural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division currently provides rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical\nand horizontal drilling. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide aviation services, equipment rentals, remote accommodations and equipment manufacturing. We\nbelieve that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources as well as in\nmaintaining and improving electrical infrastructure. Our complementary suite of services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base\nand geographic positioning.\nThe growth of our industrial businesses is ongoing. We offer infrastructure engineering services focused on the transmission and distribution industry and also have\nequipment manufacturing operations and offer fiber optic services. Our equipment manufacturing operations provide us with the ability to repair much of our existing equipment\nin-house, as well as the option to manufacture certain new equipment we may need in the future. Our fiber optic services include the installation of both aerial and buried fiber. We\nare continuing to explore other opportunities to expand our industrial business lines.\nOur facilities and service centers are strategically located in Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Kentucky, California, Colorado, Oregon, Indiana and Alberta, Canada primarily\nto serve the following areas:\n• The Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio;\n• Southern Ohio;\n• The Permian Basin in West Texas;\n• The Appalachian Basin in the Northeast;\n• The SCOOP and STACK in Oklahoma;\n• The Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma;\n• The Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma;\n• The Marcellus Shale in West Virginia and Pennsylvania;\n• Southeastern New Mexico;\n• The Barnett Shale in Texas;\n• The Granite Wash and Mississippi Shale in Oklahoma and Texas;\n• The Cana Woodford and Woodford Shales and the Cleveland Sand in Oklahoma;\n• Southern California; and\n• The oil sands in Alberta, Canada.\nOur operational division heads have an extensive track record in the oilfield service and infrastructure businesses with an average of over 31 years of oilfield services experience\nand over 26 years of infrastructure services experience. They bring valuable expertise and long-term customer relationships to our business. We provide our well completion,\nnatural sand proppant, drilling and other services to a diversified range of both public and private independent oil and natural gas producers and our infrastructure services to\nprivate utilities, public investor owned utilities, or IOUs, and cooperatives, or Co-Ops.\nOur Services\nOur revenues, operating income (loss) and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: well completion services, infrastructure services, natural sand\nproppant services and drilling services.\n1\nWell Completion Services\nPressure Pumping. We provide pressure pumping services, also known as hydraulic fracturing, to exploration and production companies. Fracturing services are performed to\nenhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations having low permeability such that the flow of hydrocarbons is restricted. We have significant expertise in multistage\nfracturing of horizontal oil and natural gas producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations. Currently, we provide pressure pumping services in the Utica\nShale of Eastern Ohio, the Marcellus shale in the Appalachian Basin, and the mid-continent region in Oklahoma.\nThe fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. Materials known as proppants, in our case primarily sand\nor ceramic beads, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to “break,” or loosen viscosity, and be\nforced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures created, thereby increasing the mobility of the hydrocarbons. As a result of the\nfracturing process, production rates are usually enhanced substantially, thus increasing the rate of return for the operator.\nWe refer to the group of fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a\n“crew.” We usually operate on a 24-hour-per-day basis and we typically staff three crews per fleet. All of our fracturing units and high-pressure pumps are manufactured to our\nspecifications to enhance the performance and durability of our equipment and meet our customers’ needs.\nEach hydraulic fracturing fleet includes a mobile, on-site control center that monitors pressures, rates and volumes, as applicable. From there, our field-level managers supervise\nthe job site by radio. Each control center is equipped with high bandwidth satellite hardware that provides continuous upload and download of job telemetry data. The data is\ndelivered on a real-time basis to on-site job personnel, the operator and personnel at our headquarters for display in both digital and graphical form.\nAn important element of fracturing services is determining the proper fracturing fluid, proppants and injection program to maximize results. In virtually all of our hydraulic\nfracturing jobs, our customers specify the composition of the fracturing fluid to be used. The fracturing fluid may contain hazardous substances, such as hydrochloric acid and\ncertain petrochemicals. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water. The customers remove the water from\nthe well using a controlled flow-back process, and we are generally not involved in that process or in the disposal of the fluid.\nWe own and operate fleets of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist\nprimarily of a high-pressure hydraulic pump, an engine, a transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted to a flat-bed\ntrailer. As of December 31, 2023, our pressure pumping business included six high-pressure fleets consisting of an aggregate 128 high-pressure fracturing units with pump\nnameplate capacity of 310,000 horsepower. One of our six pressure pumping fleets was staffed and providing services in the northeast region as of December 31, 2023. Over the\npast two years, we have converted two fleets to include dynamic gas blending, or DGB, capabilities to meet recent shifts in customer demand. Further, subject to market conditions\nand liquidity requirements, we have plans to upgrade one additional fleet in 2024. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Overview of Our Industries—Oil and Natural Gas Industry” for additional information.\nSand Hauling. Our sand hauling services provide last-mile trucking and logistics services for proppant used in completion activities in the Utica Shale and SCOOP/STACK. As\nof December 31, 2023, we owned a fleet of 39 trucks.\nWater Transfer. Our water transfer services provide water sourcing and water transfer services primarily for completion activities in the mid-continent region. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we owned 121 water transfer pumps and 91 miles of layflat hose.\nMaster Services Agreements. We contract with most of our well completion customers under master service agreements, or MSAs. Generally, our MSAs, including those\nrelating to our hydraulic fracturing services, specify payment terms, audit rights and insurance requirements and allocate certain operational risks through indemnity and similar\nprovision.\n2\nInfrastructure Services\nOur infrastructure services business provides engineering, design, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. We offer a\nbroad range of services on electric transmission and distribution, or T&D, networks and substation facilities, which include engineering, design, construction, upgrade, maintenance\nand repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. Our commercial services include the installation,\nmaintenance and repair of commercial wiring. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and other disasters. We provide infrastructure services\nprimarily in the northeast, southwest, midwest and western portions of the United States.\nWe currently have agreements in place with private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Since we commenced operations in this line of business, a substantial portion of our\ninfrastructure revenue has been generated from storm restoration work, primarily from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, due to damage caused by Hurricane\nMaria. On October 19, 2017, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid. The one-\nyear contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million. On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second one-year, $900 million master services\nagreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico. Our work under each of the contracts\nwith PREPA ended on March 31, 2019. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result,\nPREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the FEMA or other sources.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PREPA owed Cobra approximately $204.8 million for services performed, excluding $197.5 million of interest charged on delinquent balances.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid an aggregate of $64.0 million with respect to the PREPA account receivable, of which $9.6 million was paid to Cobra and\n$54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, LLC (“SPCP Group”) under the assignment agreement with Cobra, pursuant to which on December 1, 2023, Cobra transferred\napproximately $54.4 million of its outstanding PREPA receivable to SPCP Group in exchange for Cobras receipt of $46.1 million in net proceeds. Following the payment of $54.4\nmillion to SPCP Group, all of Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations under the assignment agreement were fully extinguished and the agreement was terminated. See Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies—Accounts Receivable and Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A., and\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve” included elsewhere in this annual report for more information regarding these delinquent balances as\nwell as other legal actions and governmental investigations related to our work for PREPA, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cobra Assignment Agreement” for additional information regarding the assignment agreement with SPCP Group.\nDuring 2022, operational improvements combined with increased crew count drove enhanced results in our infrastructure services division compared to 2021. Although\nour average crew count declined slightly from approximately 91 crews throughout 2022 to approximately 83 crews throughout 2023, operational efficiencies drove comparable\nresults. Funding for projects in the infrastructure space remains strong with added opportunities expected from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into\nlaw on November 15, 2021. We anticipate the federal spending to begin fueling additional projects in this sector and expect bidding activity to ramp up in 2024. We continue to\nfocus on operational execution and pursue opportunities within this sector as we strategically structure our service offerings for growth, intending to increase our infrastructure\nservices activity and expand both our geographic footprint and depth of projects, especially in fiber maintenance and installation projects.\nWe work for multiple utilities primarily across the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. We believe that we are well-\npositioned to compete for new projects due to the experience of our infrastructure management team, combined with our vertically integrated service offerings. We are seeking to\nleverage this experience and our service offerings to grow our customer base and increase our revenues in the continental United States over the coming years.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\nIn our natural sand proppant business, we mine, process and sell sand. In the past, we have also bought processed sand from suppliers on the spot market for resale. Natural sand\nproppant, also known as frac sand, is the most widely used type of proppant due to its broad applicability in unconventional oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative\nto other proppants. Natural frac sand may be used as proppant in all but the highest pressure and temperature environments and is being employed in nearly all major U.S.\nunconventional oil and natural gas producing basins, including those in which we operate.\n3\nAt our Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin plants, we mine and process sand into premium monocrystalline sand, a specialized mineral that is used as frac sand. We\ncan also purchase raw or washed sand and process it at our indoor sand processing plant located in Pierce County, Wisconsin; however, this facility has been temporarily idled\nsince September 2018 due to market conditions. We sell sand to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance recovery rates from unconventional wells.\nOur sand processing plants produce a range of frac sand sizes for use in all major North American shale basins, including a majority of the standard proppant sizes as defined by the\nISO/API 13503-2 specifications. These grain sizes can be customized to meet the demands of our customers with respect to a specific well. Our supply of Jordan substrate exhibits\nthe physical properties necessary to withstand the completion and production environments of the wells in these shale basins. Our indoor processing plant in Pierce County,\nWisconsin is designed for year-round continuous wet and dry plant operation. Our multi-environment processing plants in Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin have\nindoor dry plants designed to operate year-round and outdoor wet plants that generally operate eight months per year.\nWe also provide logistics solutions to facilitate delivery of our frac sand products to our customers. Our frac sand products are primarily shipped by rail to our customers in the\nUtica Shale, SCOOP/STACK, DJ Basin, Permian Basin and the Montney Shale in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. Our logistics capabilities are important to our customers,\nwho focus on both the reliability and flexibility of product delivery. Because our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities near their well\ncompletion sites, they typically prefer product to be delivered where and as needed, which requires predictable and efficient loading and shipping capabilities. We contract with\nthird party providers to transport our frac sand products to railroad facilities for delivery to our customers. We currently lease or have access to origin transloading facilities on the\nCanadian National Railway Company (CN), Union Pacific (UP), Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and the Canadian Pacific (CP) rail systems and use an in-house railcar fleet\nthat we lease from various third parties to deliver our frac sand products to our customers. Origin transloading facilities on multiple railways allow us to provide predictable and\nefficient loading and shipping of our frac sand products. We also utilize a destination transloading facility in Yorkville, Ohio, to serve the Utica Shale, and utilize destination\ntransloading facilities located in other North American resource plays, including the Montney Shale, to meet our customers’ delivery needs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a sand supply agreement with a third-party service provider. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to supply, in\naggregate, approximately 709 thousand tons of sand over the contract period of 12 months.\nDrilling Services\nDue to market conditions, we temporarily shut-down our rig moving services in April 2020 and our contract land drilling operations beginning in December 2019. We\ncontinue to maintain our equipment and monitor market conditions to determine if and when we will recommence these services.\nDirectional Drilling. Our directional drilling services provide for the efficient drilling and production of oil and natural gas from unconventional resource plays. Our\ndirectional drilling equipment includes mud motors used to propel drill bits and kits for measurement-while-drilling, or MWD, and electromagnetic, or EM, technology. MWD kits\nare down-hole tools that provide real-time measurements of the location and orientation of the bottom-hole assembly, which is necessary to adjust the drilling process and guide the\nwellbore to a specific target. This technology, coupled with our complementary services, allows our customers to drill wellbores to specific objectives within narrow location\nparameters within target horizons. The evolution of unconventional resource reserve recovery has increased the need for the precise placement of a wellbore. Wellbores often travel\nacross long-lateral intervals within narrow formations as thin as ten feet. Our personnel are involved in all aspects of a well from the initial planning of a customer’s drilling\nprogram to the management and execution of the horizontal or directional drilling operation.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned four MWD kits and one EM kit used in vertical, horizontal and directional drilling applications, 89 mud motors, nine air motors and an\ninventory of related parts and equipment. Currently, we perform our directional drilling services in the Utica Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Powder River Basin and\nPermian Basin.\nContract Drilling. As part of our contract drilling services, we provided both vertical and horizontal drilling services to customers in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As\nof December 31, 2023, we owned 11 land drilling rigs, ranging from 800 to 1,600 horsepower, seven of which are specifically designed for drilling horizontal and directional\nwells.\nOur drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 12,500 feet to 20,000 feet. Of these drilling rigs, six are electric rigs and five are mechanical rigs. An\nelectric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the power from its generators (which in the case of mechanical rigs, power the rig directly) into electricity\nto power the rig. Depth\n4\nand complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job. Power requirements for drilling\njobs may vary considerably, but most of our mechanical drilling rigs employ six engines to generate between 800 and 1,200 horsepower, depending on well depth and rig design.\nMost drilling rigs capable of drilling in deep formations drill to measured depths greater than 10,000 to 18,000 feet. Generally, land rigs operate with four crews of five people and\ntwo tool pushers, or rig managers, rotating on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.\nWe believe that our drilling rigs and other related equipment are in good operating condition. Our employees perform periodic maintenance and minor repair work on our\ndrilling rigs.\nPrior to our temporary shutdown of these services in December 2019, we obtained our contracts for drilling oil and natural gas wells either through competitive bidding or\nthrough direct negotiations with customers. We typically entered into drilling contracts that provided for compensation on a daywork basis. Occasionally, we entered into drilling\ncontracts that provided for compensation on a footage basis; however, a majority of such footage drilling contracts also provided for daywork rates for work outside core drilling\nactivities contemplated by such footage contracts and under certain other circumstances. We have not historically entered into turnkey contracts; however, we may decide to enter\ninto such contracts in the future. It is also possible that we may acquire such contracts in connection with future acquisitions of drilling assets. Contract terms generally depend on\nthe complexity and risk of operations, the on-site drilling conditions, the type of equipment used, the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and market conditions.\nRig Moving. We provided rig moving services in the Permian Basin. Due to market conditions, we temporarily shut-down our rig moving operations beginning in April\n2020. As of December 31, 2023, we owned 15 trucks specifically tailored to move rigs.\nOther Services\nWe also offer a variety of other services including aviation services, equipment rental services, remote accommodation services and equipment manufacturing services.\nAdditionally, during certain of the periods discussed in this report, we offered coil tubing services, pressure control services, flowback services, crude oil hauling services,\ncementing services and acidizing services.\nAviation Services. Our aviation services include leasing helicopters to customers for use primarily in the electrical utility industry. Additionally, we provide helicopter\ntraining and response services. As of December 31, 2023, we owned two helicopters.\nEquipment Rentals. Our equipment rental services provide a wide range of oilfield related equipment used in drilling, flowback and hydraulic fracturing services. Our\nequipment rentals consist of cranes, light plants, generators and other oilfield related equipment. We provide equipment rental in the Permian Basin, Utica Shale and Marcellus\nShale.\nRemote Accommodations. Our remote accommodations business provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote\nareas away from readily available lodging. We provide a turnkey solution for our customers’ accommodation needs. These modular camps, when assembled together, form large\ndormitories, with kitchen/dining facilities and recreation areas. These camps are operated as “all inclusive,” where meals are prepared and provided for the guests. The primary\nrevenue source for these camps is lodging fees. As of December 31, 2023, we had a capacity of 878 rooms, 612 of which are at Sand Tiger Lodge, our camp in northern Alberta,\nCanada, and 266 of which are available to be leased as rental equipment to a third party. On average, 178 rooms were utilized per night during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nEquipment Manufacturing. Our equipment manufacturing operations, which are located at our facility in Oklahoma, have primarily served our internal needs for our pressure\npumping, water transfer, equipment rental and infrastructure businesses, but we have the ability to expand into third party sales in the future.\nWe also offered coil tubing services, pressure control services, flowback services, crude oil hauling services, cementing services and acidizing services during certain of the\nperiods discussed in this report. Due to market conditions, we temporarily shut down our flowback, cementing and acidizing operations beginning in July 2019, our coil tubing,\npressure control and full service transportation operations beginning in July 2020 and our crude oil hauling operations beginning in July 2021. We continue to maintain our\nequipment and monitor market conditions to determine if and when we will recommence these services.\n5\nFlowback. Our flowback services consisted of production testing, solids control, hydrostatic testing and torque services. Flowback involves the process of allowing fluids to flow\nfrom the well following a treatment, either in preparation for an impending phase of treatment or to return the well to production. Our flowback equipment consists of manifolds,\naccumulators, valves, flare stacks and other associated equipment. We provided flowback services in the Appalachian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale and mid-\ncontinent markets. As of December 31, 2023, we owned 20 solids control packages, four hydrostatic testing packages and seven torque service packages.\nCementing and Acidizing. We provided cementing and acidizing services in the Permian Basin. Cementing services involve preparing and pumping cement into place in a\nwellbore to support and protect well casings and help achieve zonal isolation. Acidizing services involve pumping acid into a wellbore to improve productivity or injectivity. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we owned four acidizing pumps.\nCoil Tubing. We provided coil tubing services in Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin. Coiled tubing services involve injecting coiled tubing into wells to perform various well-\nservicing and workover operations. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of typically less than three inches and manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of\nfeet. It is wound or coiled on a truck-mounted reel for onshore applications. Due to its small diameter in certain iterations, coiled tubing can be inserted into existing production\ntubing and used to perform a variety of services to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas without using a larger, more costly workover rig. The principal advantages of using coiled\ntubing in a workover include the ability to (i) continue production from the well without interruption, thus reducing the risk of formation damage, (ii) move continuous coiled\ntubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe in the case of a workover rig, which must be jointed and unjointed, (iii) direct fluids into a wellbore with\nmore precision, allowing for improved stimulation fluid placement, (iv) provide a source of energy to power a downhole mud motor or manipulate down-hole tools and (v) enhance\naccess to remote fields due to the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit. As of December 31, 2023, we owned two coiled tubing units capable of running 23,500 feet of\ntwo and three eighths inch coil rated at 15,000 psi, one coiled tubing unit capable of running 24,500 feet of two inch coil rated at 15,000 psi, two coiled tubing units capable of\nrunning 22,500 feet of two inch coil rated at 10,000 psi and one coiled tubing unit capable of running 20,500 feet of two and three eighths inch coil rated at 15,000 psi.\nPressure Control. Our pressure control services consisted of nitrogen and fluid pumping services. Our pressure control services equipment is designed to support activities in\nunconventional resource plays with the ability to operate under high pressures without having to delay or cease production during completion operations. Ceasing or suppressing\nproduction during the completion phase of an unconventional well could result in formation damage impacting the overall recovery of reserves. Our pressure control services\nhelped operators minimize the risk of such damage during completion activities. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of four nitrogen pumping units and five fluid pumping\nunits. We provided pressure control services in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin.\n• Nitrogen Services. Nitrogen services involve the use of nitrogen, an inert gas, in various pressure pumping operations. When provided as a stand-alone service, nitrogen is\nused in displacing fluids in various oilfield applications. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of four nitrogen pumping units capable of pumping at a rate of up to\n3,000 standard cubic feet per minute with pressures up to 10,000 psi. Pumping at these rates and pressures is typically required for the unconventional oil and natural gas\nresource plays we serve.\n• Fluid Pumping Services. Fluid pumping services consist of maintaining well pressure, pumping down wireline tools, assisting coiled tubing units and the removal of fluids\nand solids from the wellbore for clean-out operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had five fluid pumping units. Three of these units are coiled tubing double pump units\ncapable of output of up to eight barrels per minute and are rated for pressures up to 15,000 psi. Two of these units are quintuplex pump units capable of output of up to 15\nbarrels per minute and are rated for pressures up to 15,000 psi.\nFull Service Transportation. During 2019, we expanded our trucking operations to include brokering and hauling of general freight throughout the United States. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had a fleet of six trucks.\nCrude Oil Hauling. We provided crude transportation services in the Permian Basin and mid-continent region. As of December 31, 2023, we had a fleet of 13 crude oil hauling\ntrucks.\n6\nOur Industries\nOil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and\ninternational supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices,\nproduction depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services\nand products budgets. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries,\ngovernment regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, storage capacity, shortages of equipment and\nmaterials and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The levels\nof capital expenditures of our customers are driven by many factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas. In March and April 2020, concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic\nand quarantine orders in the U.S. and worldwide, oil prices dropped sharply to below zero dollars per barrel for the first time in history due to factors including significantly\nreduced demand and a shortage of storage facilities. In 2021, U.S. oil production stabilized as commodity prices increased and demand for crude oil rebounded. We saw\nimprovements in the oilfield services industry and in both pricing and utilization of our well completion and drilling services during 2022. Throughout 2023, pricing for crude oil\nand natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022, which slowed down completion activities for our customers, in particular, in the Utica and Marcellus Shale natural gas plays,\nand, as a result, reduced demand for our well completion services. These factors have continued into the first quarter of 2024. Despite this short-term softness, however, we are\nseeing indications that activity levels will begin to ramp back up in mid-2024, creating the opportunity to reactivate additional fleets, if appropriate. The ongoing war in Ukraine\nand the recent Israel-Hamas war, however, could continue to have an adverse impact on the global energy markets and volatility of commodity prices, which could further\nadversely impact demand for our well completion services.\nIn response to market conditions, we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations and flowback operations beginning in July 2019, our contract drilling\noperations beginning in December 2019, our rig hauling operations beginning in April 2020, our coil tubing, pressure control and full service transportation operations beginning in\nJuly 2020 and our crude oil hauling operations beginning in July 2021. We continue to monitor the market to determine if and when we can recommence these services.\nNatural Sand Proppant Industry\nWe experienced a significant decline in demand of our sand proppant in the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020 as a result of completion activity falling due to lower\noil demand and pricing, increased capital discipline by our customers, budget exhaustion and the COVID-19 pandemic. Activity rebounded modestly in 2021 and continued to\nincrease throughout 2022 as we saw an increase in the volume of sand sold. Supply constraints from labor shortages negatively affected West Texas in-basin mine operations and\nincreased demand for Northern White frac sand for the region in 2022. Demand from oil and gas companies in Western Canada and the Marcellus Shale was also strong in 2022.\nThe increase in activity in 2022 resulted in an increase in demand and pricing for our sand, which continued throughout the first quarter of 2023. Demand for our natural sand\nproppant was adversely impacted in the second quarter of 2023 by the wildfires in Canada, which hindered our ability to transport sand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our sand\nbusiness remained resilient during the second quarter of 2023. As discussed above, pricing for crude oil and natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022, which slowed down\ncompletion activities and adversely impacted demand for our sand proppant services in the second half of 2023. We are beginning to see an uptick in orders for our sand in the first\nquarter of 2024.\nOur proppant sand reserves consist of Northern White silica sand, giving us access to a range of high-quality sand grades meeting or exceeding all API specifications,\nincluding a mix between concentrations of coarse grades (20/40 and 30/50 mesh size) and finer grades (40/70 and 100 mesh size). Our sample boring data and our historical\nproduction data have indicated that our reserves contain deposits of approximately 60% 40 mesh size or finer substrate. The coarseness and conductivity of Northern White frac\nsand significantly enhances recovery of oil and liquids-rich gas by allowing hydrocarbons to flow more freely than is sometimes possible with native sand. The low acid-solubility\nincreases the integrity of Northern White frac sand relative to other proppants with higher acid-solubility, especially in shales where hydrogen sulfide and other acidic chemicals are\nco-mingled with the targeted hydrocarbons. In addition, its crush resistant properties enable Northern White frac sand to be used in deeper drilling applications than the frac sand\nproduced from many native mineral deposits.\n7\nWe believe that the coarseness, conductivity, sphericity, acid-solubility, and crush-resistant properties of our Northern White sand reserves and our facilities’ connectivity\nto rail and other transportation infrastructure afford us a cost advantage over many of our competitors and make us one of a select group of sand producers capable of delivering\nhigh volumes of frac sand that is optimal for oil and natural gas production to all major unconventional resource basins currently producing throughout North America.\nEnergy Infrastructure Industry\nThe energy infrastructure industry involves the construction and maintenance of the electrical power grid, including power generation, high voltage transmission lines,\nsubstations and low voltage distribution lines, all of which connect power generation facilities to end users. The industry also provides storm repair and restoration services in\nresponse to storms and other disasters.\nDemand for our services is driven by the repair and construction of transmission lines, fiber lines, substations and distribution networks and is determined by the level of\nexpenditures of utility companies. While expansion of the electrical grid is occurring, the majority of capital expenditures spent in recent years has surrounded the repair and\nmaintenance of existing networks. Another factor that significantly influences the level of spending in the industry are natural disasters, including thunderstorms, ice storms, snow\nstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires and lightning strikes, all of which can impact the electrical grid.\nCertain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record\nof operational success. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety\nrecord and customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they generally award most of their work through a\nbid process. Consequently, price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected.\nWe believe that the age of the existing infrastructure across the United States and the spending trends in North America will benefit our operations and our ability to\nachieve our business objectives. Funding for projects in the infrastructure space remains strong with added opportunities expected from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,\nwhich was signed into law on November 15, 2021.\nOur Strengths\nOur primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for our stockholders through organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. We believe that\nthe following strengths position us well to capitalize on activity in unconventional resource plays and achieve our primary business objective:\n• Strategic geographic positioning. We currently operate facilities and service centers to support our oilfield service operations in major unconventional resource plays in the\nUnited States, including the Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma, the Marcellus\nShale in West Virginia, the Granite Wash in Oklahoma and Texas, the Cana Woodford Shale in Oklahoma and the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. We currently operate\ninfrastructure facilities and service centers to support our infrastructure operations in the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States.\nWe believe our geographic positioning within active oil and natural gas liquids resource plays will benefit us strategically as activity increases in these unconventional\nresource plays.\n• Experienced management and operating team. Our operational division heads have an extensive track record in the oilfield and infrastructure service businesses with an\naverage of over 31 years of oilfield services experience and over 26 years of infrastructure services experience. In addition, our field managers have expertise in the areas in\nwhich they operate and understand the challenges that our customers face. We believe their knowledge of our industries and business lines enhances our ability to provide\ninnovative, client-focused and basin-specific customer service, which we also believe strengthens our relationships with our customers.\n• Fleet of equipment. Our oilfield service fleet is predominantly comprised of equipment designed to optimize recovery from unconventional wells and our infrastructure\nservice fleet is predominantly comprised of equipment designed to construct and repair electric transmission and distribution lines. We believe that our fleet of quality\nequipment will allow us to provide a high level of service to our customers. In addition, we have converted two fleets of our pressure\n8\npumping units to include DGB capabilities to meet recent shifts in customer demand and expect to convert one additional fleet during 2024, subject to market conditions and\nliquidity requirements.\nOur Business Strategy\nWe intend to achieve our primary business objective by the successful execution of our business plan to strategically deploy our equipment and personnel to provide well\ncompletion services, natural sand proppant services and other energy services in unconventional resource plays, including the Utica Shale in Ohio, the SCOOP/STACK in\nOklahoma and the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia. We intend to achieve our primary business objective in connection with our infrastructure services by the successful execution\nof our business plan to strategically deploy equipment and personnel to provide infrastructure services across the United States. We believe our infrastructure services optimize our\ncustomers’ ability to maintain, improve and expand their infrastructure and that our oil and natural gas services optimize our customers’ ultimate resources recovery and present\nvalue of hydrocarbon reserves. We seek to create cost efficiencies for our customers by providing a suite of complementary services designed to address a wide range of our\ncustomers’ needs. Specifically, we strive to create value for our stockholders through the following strategies:\n• Leverage our broad range of services for cross-selling opportunities. We offer a complementary suite of services and products. Our well completion services division\nprovide hydraulic fracturing services for unconventional wells as well as sand hauling services and water transfer services. Our infrastructure services division provides\nengineering, design, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our natural sand proppant services division mines,\nprocesses and sells natural sand proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, we provide directional drilling services, equipment rentals, remote accommodations and\nequipment manufacturing. We intend to leverage our existing customer relationships and operational track record to cross sell our services and increase our exposure and\nproduct offerings to our existing customers, broaden our customer base and expand opportunistically to other geographic regions in which our customers have operations, as\nwell as to create operational efficiencies for our customers.\n• Expand our energy infrastructure business. On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law. This is expected to bring\nnew opportunities in the infrastructure industry, including new fiber-related projects. We consistently monitor market conditions and intend to expand the capacity and\nscope of our energy infrastructure services as demand warrants in geographic areas in which we currently operate, as well as in new geographic areas.\n• Capitalize on activity in the unconventional resource plays. Our oil and natural gas service equipment is designed to provide a broad range of services for unconventional\nwells, and our operations are strategically located in major unconventional resource plays. During 2023, oil prices fluctuated between a low of $66.74 on March 17, 2023,\nand a high of $93.68 on September 27, 2023, and averaged $77.61 per barrel for the year. We saw a decline in commodity pricing during 2023, resulting in lower utilization\nand margins for our oilfield services divisions.\n• Maintain a conservative balance sheet. We seek to maintain a conservative balance sheet, which allows us to better react to changes in commodity prices and related\ndemand for our services, as well as overall market conditions. During 2023, we reduced our outstanding debt balance by $40.7 million, from $83.5 million as of December\n31, 2022 to $42.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n• Expand our services to meet expanding customer demand. The scope of services for horizontal wells is greater than that for conventional wells. Industry analysts have\nreported that the average horsepower required for current completion designs, amount of sand per lateral foot, length of lateral and number of fracture stages has continued\nto increase since 2008. We consistently monitor market conditions and intend to expand the capacity and scope of our business lines if, and when, demand warrants in\nresource plays in which we currently operate, as well as in new resource plays. If we perceive unmet demand in our principal geographic locations for different service lines\nand subject to our liquidity needs, we will seek to expand our current service offerings to meet that demand.\n• Leverage our experienced operational management team expertise. We seek to manage the services we provide as closely as possible to the needs of our customer base. Our\noperational division heads have long-term relationships with our largest customers. We intend to leverage these relationships and our operational management team’s\nexpertise to deliver innovative, client focused and services to our customers.\n• Expand through selected, accretive acquisitions. To complement our organic growth and subject to our liquidity needs, we intend to pursue selected, accretive acquisitions\nof businesses and assets, primarily related to our infrastructure\n9\nservices, completion and production services and industrial based companies, that can meet our targeted returns on invested capital and enhance our portfolio of products\nand services, market positioning and/or geographic presence. We believe this approach will help facilitate the strategic expansion of our customer base, geographic presence\nand service offerings. We also believe that our industry contacts and those of Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”), our largest stockholder, may help us identify acquisition\nopportunities. We may use our common stock as consideration for accretive acquisitions.\nMarketing and Customers\nOur customers consist primarily of independent oil and natural gas producers, land-based drilling contractors, private utilities, IOUs, and Co-Ops in North America. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 360, 410 and 480 customers, respectively, including Hilcorp Energy, Devon Energy Corporation, Arsenal\nResources, Camino Natural Resources, LLC and Overland Contracting Inc. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 35%, 36% and 35%, respectively, of our revenue\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Although we believe we have a broad customer base and wide geographic coverage of operations, it is likely that we will\ncontinue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer decides not to continue to use our services and\nis not replaced by new or existing customers, our revenue would decline and our operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOperating Risks and Insurance\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the energy services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause:\n• personal injury or loss of life;\n• damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment; and\n• suspension of operations.\nIn addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location\nwhere our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nBecause our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and\npersonal injury.\nDespite our efforts to maintain safety standards, from time to time we have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In\naddition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and\nour relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of\ncompensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business auto, commercial property, motor truck cargo, umbrella liability, professional liability,\ncybersecurity, in certain instances, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance policies providing coverages of risks and amounts that we believe to be customary in our\nindustry. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations, coverage would be available under our policy for any surface or subsurface environmental clean-up and liability to\nthird parties arising from any surface or subsurface contamination. We also have certain specific coverages for some of our businesses, including our remote accommodation\nservices, pressure pumping services, directional drilling services and infrastructure engineering services.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because\ninsurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in\ncoverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our\napplicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a description of certain risks associated with our insurance policies.\n10\nSafety and Remediation Program\nIn the energy services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced and skilled\nworkforce. Many of our larger customers place an emphasis not only on pricing, but also on safety records and quality management systems of contractors. We have committed\nresources toward employee safety and quality management training programs. Our field employees are required to complete both technical and safety training programs. Further,\nas part of our safety program and remediation procedures, we check treating iron for any defects on a periodic basis to avoid iron failure during hydraulic fracturing operations,\nmarking such treating iron to reflect the most recent testing date. We also regularly monitor pressure levels in the treating iron used for fracturing and the surface casing to verify\nthat the pressure and flow rates are consistent with the job specific model in an effort to avoid failure. As part of our safety procedures, we also have the capability to shut down our\npressure pumping and fracturing operations both at the pumps and in our data van. In addition, we maintain spill kits on location for containment of pollutants that may be spilled in\nthe process of providing our hydraulic fracturing services. The spill kits are generally comprised of pads and booms for absorption and containment of spills, as well as soda ash for\nneutralizing acid. Fire extinguishers are also in place on job sites at each pump.\nHistorically, we have used third-party contractors to provide remediation and spill response services when necessary to address spills that were beyond our containment\ncapabilities. None of these prior spills were significant, and we have not experienced any material incidents, citations or legal proceeding relating to our hydraulic fracturing or\ncrude hauling services for environmental concerns. To the extent our hydraulic fracturing or other energy services operations result in a future spill, leak or other environmental\nimpact that is beyond our ability to contain, we intend to engage the services of such remediation company or an alternative company to assist us with clean-up and remediation.\nCompetition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a company must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas\nexploration and production companies, drilling services contractors, private utilities, IOUs and Co-Ops at competitive prices.\nWe provide our services and products across the United States and in Alberta, Canada and we compete against different companies in each geographic area and service and\nproduct line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small energy service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies and energy\ninfrastructure companies. Our major competitors in well completion services include Halliburton Company, Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc., NexTier Oilfield Solutions, Inc.,\nRPC Incorporated, Liberty Oilfield Services, Inc. and ProFrac Holding Corp. Our major competitors for our infrastructure services business include MYR Group, Inc., Quanta\nServices, Inc., MasTec, Inc. and EMCOR Group, Inc. Our major competitors in our natural sand proppant services business are Badger Mining Corporation, Covia Holdings\nCorporation, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Capital Sand Proppants LLC, Athabasca Minerals Inc., Source Energy Services Ltd., and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service and products, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, availability\nand price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services and products based on the local leadership and expertise that our field\nmanagement and operating personnel use to deliver quality services and products.\nRegulation\nWe operate under the jurisdiction of a number of regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety standards, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction\nprojects, building and electrical codes regulations, government project regulations, the handling of hazardous materials, the transportation of explosives, the protection of human\nhealth and the environment and driving standards of operation. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance which is\nincorporated into our daily operating procedures. The oil and natural gas and infrastructure industries are subject to environmental and other regulation pursuant to local, state and\nfederal legislation.\nTransportation Matters\nIn connection with the transportation and relocation of our equipment and shipment of frac sand, crude oil and general cargo, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As\nsuch, we operate as a motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation and by various\nstate agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier\n11\noperations, driver licensing and insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous\nmaterials (HAZMAT). Our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include\nincreasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period,\nonboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, a unit within the United States\nDepartment of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Matters such as the weight\nand dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase\nfederal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what\nform, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nCertain motor vehicle operators require registration with the Department of Transportation. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The Department of\nTransportation periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria which could result in a suspension of\noperations. The rating scale consists of “satisfactory,” “conditional” and “unsatisfactory” ratings. As of December 31, 2023, all of our trucking operations have “satisfactory”\nratings with the Department of Transportation. We have undertaken comprehensive efforts that we believe are adequate to comply with the regulations. Further information\nregarding our safety performance is available at the FMCSA website at www.fmcsa.dot.gov.\nIn December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component\nof CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or SMS, which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety\nperformance. The SMS is intended to allow FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. However, the agency has announced a future\nintention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. At this time, we cannot predict the effect such a\nrevision may have on our safety rating.\nEnvironmental Matters and Regulation\nOur operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.\nNumerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly\ncompliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may\nrequire the acquisition of a permit before commencing operations, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in\nconnection with our operations, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and\nother protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension\nor revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from\nour operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several.\nMoreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of\nhazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in\nmore stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial\nposition, as well as the oil and natural gas industry and infrastructure industry in general. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these\nenvironmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.\nWaste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and\ncomparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, which affect our activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage,\ndisposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in\nconjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes\nmay constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions.\n12\nAdministrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt\nmore stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been\nproposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Several environmental\norganizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as\n“hazardous.” Also, in December 2015, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. However, in April 2019, the EPA concluded that revisions\nto the federal regulations for the management of oil and gas waste are not necessary at this time. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect\non our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative\nor regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.\nRemediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA, or the\n“Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, generally imposes liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be\nresponsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or\noperator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and\ncomparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability, that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or\nremediating previously disposed substances (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater\ncontamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to\nfile claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials\nthat, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA\nand comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.\nNORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with oil and gas deposits and,\naccordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing naturally occurring radioactive materials, or NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally\noccurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by\nNORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used\nfor oil and gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM.\nWater Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and\nanalogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters\nand other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance\nwith the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into\nregulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the Corps. The scope of waters\nregulated under the CWA has fluctuated in recent years. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules expanding the scope of waters protected under\nthe Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules, and then, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a\nfinal rule replacing the 2015 rules, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down\nthe replacement rule and, on January 18, 2023, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule that would restore water protections that were in place prior to 2015. However on May\n25, 2023, the Supreme Court issued an opinion substantially narrowing the scope of “waters of the United States” protected by the CWA. On September 8, 2023, the EPA and the\nCorps published a final rule conforming their regulations to the Supreme Court decision. These recent actions have provided some clarity. However, to the extent the EPA and the\nCorps broadly interpret their jurisdiction and expand the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and\ndelays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.\nThe EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits\nfor storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas\nextraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “—\n13\nRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as\nfor monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require\nappropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that\nrequire permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and\ncriminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.\nAir Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits\nand the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New\nfacilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in\ncompliance. For example, our sand proppant services operations are subject to air permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources regulating our emission of\nfugitive dust and other constituents. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate, and federal and state\nregulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated\nstate laws and regulations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas and infrastructure projects.\nClimate Change. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, collectively\nreferred to as GHGs. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) include billions of dollars in incentives\nfor the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and\nsequestration, amongst other provisions. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge, which will be\nphased-in starting in 2024. On January 12, 2024, the EPA announced a proposed rule to implement the methane emissions charge. These incentives and regulations could\naccelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower or zero carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for our well\ncompletion, natural sand proppant and other services related to the oil and natural gas industry.\nThe EPA has also finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and almost one-half of the states have\ntaken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, states have\nimposed increasingly stringent requirement related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and gas operations.\nAt the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance\nsinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide\ntarget of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in\nGlasgow, Scotland, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emission, including reducing global methane emissions by at\nleast 30 percent by 2030 (from 2020 levels) to meet this objective. More than 150 countries have now signed on to this pledge. Most\nrecently, at the 28th Conference of the Parties in the United Arab Emirates, world leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner and to\ntriple renewables and double energy efficiency globally by 2030. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international\ncommitments.\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and\nendowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such\nenvironmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access\ncapital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under\nfederal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and\ncould allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations.\nAn unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\n14\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea\nlevels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our productivity and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme\nweather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting\nour operations.\nEndangered Species Act\nEnvironmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, as amended, or the ESA, may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The\nESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under\nthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\nof listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe\nthat we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may\ndesignate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or\nbecome subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.\nRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing\nA portion of our business is dependent on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice\nthat is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and\nchemicals (also called “proppants”) under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas\ncommissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic\nfracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control\nwells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil\nand natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plans. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as\ncentralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT\nfacilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities and the\nenvironmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. Furthermore, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, to repeal the exemption for hydraulic\nfracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as\nlegislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress.\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural\ngas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes New Source Performance standards, which we refer to as NSP standards, to address emissions of sulfur\ndioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and\nprocessing activities. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green\ncompletions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from\ncompressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry\nand the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to\nsome of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended the NSP standards to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain\nnew, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, on August 13, 2020, in response to an executive order by\nformer President Trump to review and revise unduly burdensome regulations, the EPA amended the 2012 and 2016 New Source Performance standards to ease regulatory burdens,\nincluding rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law\na joint resolution of Congress disapproving the 2020 amendments (with the exception of some technical changes) thereby reinstating the 2012 and 2016 New Source Performance\nstandards. The EPA expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take “immediate steps” to comply with these standards. Additionally, on December 2, 2023, the EPA\nannounced a final rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring\nincreased monitoring\n15\nof fugitive emissions, imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations. In July 2023, the Biden\nAdministration also announced a new Cabinet-level task force aimed at detecting and cracking down on methane leaks. These new standards, as well as any future laws and their\nimplementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air\nemissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory\nrequirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.\nIn addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires\npublic disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of\ndetailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. Also, on November 18, 2016,\nthe BLM finalized a waste prevention rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators\nto use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of\ngas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order\ndirecting the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final\nrule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. A coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the State of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. Also,\non September 28, 2018, the BLM finalized revisions to the waste prevention rule to reduce “unnecessary compliance burdens”. However, a federal court struck down the scaled-\nback rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 waste prevention rule. On November 28, 2022, the BLM\nannounced a proposed replacement rule to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands, which\nwould require the use of upgraded equipment in some cases and would place time and volume limits on royalty-free flaring. Also, on July 24, 2023, the BLM published a\nproposed rule to update its oil and gas leasing regulations, which would increase bonding requirements and raise royalty rates. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will\nbe implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations.\nThere are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the\nEPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in\nhydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public\nconcern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic\nevents. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of\nhydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further\nregulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nSeveral states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic\nfracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards, require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids and/or impose restrictions on\nthe use of produced water from hydraulic fracturing activities or moratoriums on new produced water well permits in an effort to control induced seismicity. Any increased\nregulation of hydraulic fracturing or related activities could reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our reserves and results of operations.\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water\nsupplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated\nacross the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more\ndifficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to\ninitiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is\nfurther regulated at the federal, state or local level, our customers’ fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more\nstringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting\ndelays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative or regulatory changes could cause us or our customers to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the\nconsequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse\n16\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local\nlaws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nRegulation of Natural Sand Proppant Services\nThe MSHA has primary regulatory jurisdiction over commercial silica operations, including quarries, surface mines, underground mines and industrial mineral processing\nfacilities. MSHA representatives perform at least two annual inspections of our production facilities to ensure employee and general site safety. To date, these inspections have not\nresulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards, and we believe we are in material compliance with MSHA requirements.\nOther Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant\nreview for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to\nissue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These\nbinding rules and regulations are subject to changes in interpretation or enforcement. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the\ndemand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.\nDrilling. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells,\ndrilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:\n• the location of wells;\n• the method of drilling and casing wells;\n• the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;\n• the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;\n• the plugging and abandoning of wells; and\n• notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.\nFederal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines\nand for site restoration in areas where we operate. Although the Corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such\nrequirements.\nState Regulation. The states in which we or our customers operate regulate the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including through\nrequirements relating to the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may also\nregulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both.\nStates do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but they may do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the\namount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or locations our customers can drill.\nIn 2015, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, or the ODNR, enacted a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the construction of well pads. Under these rules, operators\nmust submit detailed horizontal well pad site plans certified by a professional engineer for review by the ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management prior to the\nconstruction of a well pad. These rules have resulted in increased construction costs for operators. The ODNR also adopted rules that took effect January 13, 2022 addressing the\nsiting, permitting and construction of new oil and gas facilities and disposal wells. These rules, among other things, set forth siting and setback criteria, prescribe detailed\nconstruction and operational requirements, establish insurance and financial assurance requirements, and institute requirements for decommissioning. As of January 2024, the\nODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management is updating sections of the Ohio Administrative Code that regulate oil and gas activity, including proposed changes to the\nprovisions governing the design, construction, modification, and reclamation of well sites used to drill and produce horizontal oil and gas wells.\nThe petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and\nequal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.\n17\nRegulation of Infrastructure Services\nIn our infrastructure business, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including:\n• licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;\n• regulations governing environmental and conservation matters;\n• regulations relating to worker safety;\n• permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;\n• wage and hour regulations;\n• building and electrical codes; and\n• special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.\nWe believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our energy infrastructure services and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or\ncancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.\nOSHA Matters\nWe are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and\nsafety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and\nthat this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse\neffect on our operations or financial position.\nEmployees, Safety and Diversity\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 733 full time employees. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. None of our\nemployees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land, technical,\nregulatory and other disciplines to assist our full-time employees.\nWe view our employees as our greatest asset and actively recruit talented people regardless of gender or ethnic background. We also promote diversity, inclusion and\nequal employment opportunities by evaluating and promoting employees based on skills and performance alone, while also seeking to attract and retain a diverse workforce and\ncontinuing to cultivate an inclusive and respectful work environment. One of six of our current board members and director nominees is ethnically diverse. Further, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, over 11% of our employees were women and 22 of 97 employees holding managerial and other key positions within the organization are women. Also, over\n11% of our employees self-identify as ethnic minorities as of December 31, 2023. Further, we invest in the learning and development of our employees. We strive to identify talent\nand to provide employees who demonstrate exceptional performance with opportunities and training to progress to higher levels within the organization.\nWe maintain a culture of safety, committed to the protection of the health and safety of our employees as well as preserving the environment and our relationships with\nthe communities in which we operate. We place a strong emphasis on the safe execution of our operations, including safety training for our employees. We have a comprehensive\napproach to formulating and managing training requirements for our operational employees. This includes periodic environmental, health and safety meetings, a combination of\nlive in-person training and computer-based training tailored to specific job duties and operational activities, and comprehensive safety reference material. In addition, our safety\nrecognition program encourages employees throughout our organization to focus on conducting operations in accordance with our strict safety standards. Further, we work closely\nwith federal, state and local governments and community organizations to help ensure that our operations comply with legal requirements and community standards. Lastly, when\nour employees identify a heightened safety risk, we respond quickly to mitigate the risk through communication, coordination and, if appropriate, a change in policy, procedures\nand training. We believe that our customers select their operational partners based in part on the quality of their safety and compliance records, and therefore, we will continue to\nmake investments in this area. We also empower all personnel with stop-work authority (“SWA”) as a tool for helping ensure safety. Our SWA policy empowers our employees to\nstop work whenever they identify unsafe work conditions. When SWA is employed, operations cease until the risk is addressed and both\n18\nthe employee and management agree that it is safe to resume work. See also “Safety and Remediation Program” below for additional information.\nAvailability of Company Reports\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\n13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.mammothenergy.com as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve\nCobra, one of our infrastructure services subsidiaries, was party to service contracts with PREPA. Due to PREPA’s bankruptcy proceedings, PREPA’s ability to meet its\npayment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the FEMA or other sources. In the event that PREPA does not pay amounts owed to us for\nservices performed, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nOn October 19, 2017, one of our subsidiaries, Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid as a result of\nHurricane Maria. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million (the “first contract”). On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second\none-year,\n20\n$900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico (the “second\ncontract”). As of December 31, 2023, PREPA owed us approximately $204.8 million for services performed excluding $197.5 million of interest charged on delinquent balances.\nPREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA’s ability to meet its payment\nobligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the FEMA or other sources. Since September 30, 2019, we have been pursuing litigation in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico and other dispute resolution efforts seeking recovery of the amounts owed to Cobra by PREPA for restoration services in Puerto Rico, which\nproceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 20—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” included elsewhere in this report. In connection with these efforts, in 2023,\nan aggregate of $99 million was approved by FEMA for reimbursement to Cobra for services performed by Cobra, of which amount approximately $22.2 million was paid by\nPREPA to Cobra in 2023. On December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with SPCP\nGroup, LLC (“SPCP Group”), pursuant to which Cobra transferred to SPCP Group all of its rights, title and interest in $54.4 million of outstanding accounts receivable with\nPREPA and received net proceeds of $46.1 million. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cobra Assignment Agreement” for additional information. On December 4, 2023,\nfollowing submission of a joint status report by Cobra and FEMA on December 1, 2023, in which, among other things, PREPA reported that they submitted a request for\nreimbursement to the Government of Puerto Rico’s Central Recovery and Reconstruction Office (“COR3”) on November 1, 2023 for $82.4 million and is disputing approximately\n$1.5 million of invoices from Cobra, the Court ordered PREPA to provide a detailed summary of each of their objections to the disputed amounts and directed the parties to report\nthe status of any remaining unpaid approved invoices in connection with the status report due on January 16, 2024. On January 16, 2024, the parties filed a joint status report in\nwhich, among other things, PREPA reported that on December 28, 2023, it received a disbursement from COR3 for the amount requested on November 1, 2023 and was in the\nprocess of paying approximately $13.4 million in approved but unpaid invoices for reimbursements for services performed by Cobra to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee, which\namount was paid by PREPA on January 18, 2024. PREPA, however, also informed the Court that it will withhold the release of any further funds to Cobra approved by FEMA for\nreimbursement to Cobra due to the municipal and construction excise tax claims against Cobra allegedly aggregating to $70.4 million. Cobra believes it is exempt from the\nconstruction excise taxes and strongly disagrees with PREPA’s decision to withhold funds. On January 17, 2024, Cobra filed a Writ of Certiorari requesting the Court of Appeals\nto reverse the order from the Humacao Superior Court. On February 15, 2024, Cobra’s request was granted by the Court of Appeals and the order instructing PREPA to withhold\nthe $9.0 million payment from Cobra was revoked. The case was remanded to the lower Court for continuation of the proceedings in accordance with the Court of Appeals’ order.\nThe municipality has 15 days to request reconsideration. On January 19, 2024, the Court extended the previously ordered stay in the proceedings through April 5, 2024, and\ndirected the parties to file a joint status report addressing (i) the status of any administrative appeals in connection with the November 2022 and December 2022 determination\nmemoranda regarding the second contract, (ii) the status of any remaining approved, but unpaid invoices, and (iii) whether the parties are actively engaged in mediation to resolve\ntheir outstanding issues by March 27, 2024. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable, of which $9.6\nmillion was paid to Cobra and $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s\nobligations to SPCP Group under the Assignment Agreement, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated.\nWe believe all amounts charged to PREPA were properly in accordance with the terms of these contracts. Further, we believe these receivables are collectible. However,\nin the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to\npay the amounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the receivable may not be collected and our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. Further, as noted above, our contracts with PREPA have concluded and we have not obtained, and there can\nbe no assurance that we will be able to obtain, one or more contracts with other customers to replace the level of services that we provided to PREPA.\nOur customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our significant customers, or their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, could cause our revenue to\ndecline substantially.\nWhen a major customer discontinues the use our services, our revenue will decline and our operating results and financial condition will be harmed unless such loss is offset by\nnew business. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 35%, 36% and 35%, respectively, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. It is\nlikely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to\nthe concentration of our customer base. In particular, PREPA owed us approximately $402.3 million (including interest charged on overdue amounts) as of December 31, 2023, as\ndiscussed in more detail above. Any nonperformance by our counterparties, including their failure to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all, either as a result of\nchanges in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity.\n21\nWe may experience losses in excess of our recorded reserves for receivables.\nWe evaluate the collectability of our receivables based on consideration of a customer’s ability to make required payments, payment history, economic events and other\nfactors. Recorded reserves represent our estimate of current expected credit losses on existing receivables and are determined based on historical customer reviews, current\nfinancial conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. An unexpected change in customer financial condition or future economic uncertainty could result in additional\nrequirements for specific reserves, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the recent Israel-Hamas war on the global economy, energy markets, geopolitical stability, industries in which\nwe operate and our business.\nAll of our infrastructure, well completion, natural sand proppant, drilling and other services are concentrated in North America. However, the broader consequences of the\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict, and the Israel-Hamas war may increase volatility in the price and demand for oil and natural gas, which would adversely impact the oilfield services\nindustry, increase exposure to cyberattacks, cause disruptions in global supply chains, increase foreign currency fluctuations, cause constraints or disruption in the capital markets\nand limit sources of liquidity. We cannot predict the extent of these wars’ effect on our business and results of operations as well as on the global economy, energy markets and\nindustries in which we operate.\nThe outcomes of investigations and litigation relating to our contracts with PREPA may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nOn September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico unsealed an indictment that charged three individuals, including the former president of\nCobra with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. The indictment is focused on the interactions between a former FEMA official and the former President of\nCobra. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were charged in the indictment. On May 18, 2022, the former FEMA official and the former president of Cobra each pled guilty to\none-count information charging gratuities related to a project that Cobra never bid upon and was never awarded or received any monies for. On December 13, 2022, the Court\nsentenced the formed Cobra president to custody of the Bureau of Prisons for six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and one day and a fine of $25,000.\nThe Court sentenced the FEMA official to custody of the Bureau of Prisons for six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and a fine of $15,000. The Court\nalso dismissed the indictment against the two defendants. We do not expect any additional activity in the criminal proceeding. Given the uncertainty inherent in criminal litigation,\nhowever, it is not possible at this time to determine the potential impacts that the sentencing could have on us. PREPA has stated in Court filings that it may contend the alleged\ncriminal activity affects Cobra’s entitlement to payment under its contracts with PREPA. It is unclear what PREPA’s position will be going forward. Subsequent to the indictment,\nwe received (i) a preservation request letter from the SEC related to documents relevant to an ongoing investigation it is conducting and (ii) a civil investigative demand, or CID,\nfrom the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, requesting certain documents and answers to interrogatories relevant to an ongoing investigation DOJ is conducting. Both\nthe SEC and DOJ investigations relate to the same subjects as those at issue in the criminal matter referenced above. We have cooperated with the DOJ and are not able to predict\nthe outcome of this investigation or if it will have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. With regard to the SEC investigation,\non July 6, 2022, the SEC sent a letter saying that it had concluded its investigation as to the Company and that based on information the SEC has as of this date, it does not intend\nto recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against us. Further, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight\naudits and compliance reviews by government agencies and representatives. Accordingly, it is possible that additional investigations may arise in the future.\nOpportunities associated with government contracts could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us.\nMost government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. If we are successful in being awarded government contracts, significant costs could be\nincurred by us before any revenues were realized from these contracts. Government agencies may review a contractor’s performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards. If government agencies determine through these reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not reimburse the\ncontractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may be\nsubject to civil and criminal penalties. Government contracts are also subject to renegotiation of profit and termination by the government prior to the expiration of the term. See the\npreceding risk factors for information regarding the investigations and legal proceedings relating to our contracts with PREPA.\n22\nOur revolving credit facility and term credit facility impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur revolving credit facility and term credit facility limit, our ability to take various actions, such as:\n• incurring additional indebtedness;\n• paying dividends;\n• creating certain additional liens on our assets;\n• entering into sale and leaseback transactions;\n• making investments;\n• entering into transactions with affiliates;\n• making material changes to the type of business we conduct or our business structure;\n• making guarantees;\n• entering into hedges;\n• disposing of assets in excess of certain permitted amounts;\n• merging or consolidating with other entities; and\n• selling all or substantially all of our assets.\nA portion of our business depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of exploration and production activity within the United States and Canada,\nand continued volatility in the oil and natural gas markets have impacted, and are likely to continue to impact, our oilfield services and, as a result, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nDemand for our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of capital expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The\nlevels of capital expenditures of our customers are driven by many factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas. In March and April 2020, concurrent with the COVID-19\npandemic and quarantine orders in the U.S. and worldwide, oil prices dropped sharply to below zero dollars per barrel for the first time in history due to factors including\nsignificantly reduced demand and a shortage of storage facilities. In 2021, U.S. oil production stabilized as commodity prices increased and demand for crude oil rebounded\nthroughout 2022. During 2023, pricing for crude oil and natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022 and are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of production levels,\ninventories and demand, national and international economic performance and outlook. Other significant factors that are likely to continue to affect commodity prices in current\nand future periods include, but are not limited to, the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies, U.S. and global political developments, conditions in the U.S. oil and gas\nindustry, actions of OPEC+ members, the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the recent Israel-Hamas war on the global energy and capital markets and global stability and\nother factors. We anticipate demand for our oil and natural gas services and products will continue to be dependent on the level of capital expenditures by companies in the oil and\nnatural gas industry and, ultimately, commodity prices. While we still expect commodity prices to be the primary driver of capital spending and industry activity levels in the\nfuture, other factors, such as debt repayment obligations and access to the capital markets, may play a significant role in the ultimate level of capital expenditures by the companies\nthat use our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling service lines. Industry conditions are dynamic and the weakening of\ncommodity prices from current levels may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers’ liquidity and financial position resulting in spending reductions, delays\nin the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions, and others, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current commodity price environment will continue.\nMany factors over which we have no control affect the supply of and demand for, and our customers’ willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and\ntherefore, influence prices for our products and services, including:\n• the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n• the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n• the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n• the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n• the expected decline rates of current production;\n• the price and quantity of foreign imports;\n• political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia, including the impact of the ongoing war in\nUkraine and the recent Israel-Hamas war on the global energy and capital markets and global stability;\n23\n• the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n• speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;\n• the level of consumer product demand;\n• the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n• contractions in the credit market;\n• the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;\n• available pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n• the levels of oil and natural gas storage;\n• weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n• political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n• domestic and foreign tax policy;\n• domestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions;\n• the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;\n• technical advances affecting energy consumption;\n• the proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n• the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n• the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n• global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases;\n• merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers;\n• governmental laws, policies, regulations, subsidies, and other actions, including initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources; and\n• overall domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Any of the above\nfactors could impact the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Further, future weakness in commodity prices could impact our business going forward, and we could encounter difficulties such as an\ninability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, recognizing asset impairment charges, an inability to meet financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, a need to\nreduce our capital spending and other similar impacts.\nThe cyclicality of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are\nsignificantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. We have, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of\nthe reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry during the\nfirst half of 2020, combined with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, adverse changes in demand for our services and volatility in the capital and credit markets, caused many\nexploration and production companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely\nimpacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services. In addition, a majority of the service revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a relatively short\nperiod of time (e.g., an hour, a day, a week) for the actual period of time the service is provided to our customers. By contracting services on a short-term basis, we are exposed to\nthe risks of a rapid reduction in market prices and utilization, with resulting volatility in our revenues.\nIf oil prices or natural gas prices decline, the demand for our oil and natural gas services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our oil and natural gas services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and\nlevel of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will\ndecrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result\nin lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our well service equipment.\nAny future decline in oil and gas prices could materially affect the demand for our services. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are\nexpected to continue to be volatile in the years to come. During 2023, West Texas Intermediate posted prices ranged from $66.74 to $93.68 per barrel and the New York\nMercantile Exchange natural\n24\ngas futures prices ranged from $1.99 to $4.48 per MMBtu. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline from current levels, our operations, financial condition and level of\nexpenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition to a lower carbon footprint could adversely affect our oil and gas business.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition to a lower carbon footprint, which will require adapting our portfolio of oilfield\nservices to potentially changing or more burdensome government requirements and customer preferences. If the energy industry transition changes faster than anticipated or in a\nmanner that we do not anticipate, demand for oilfield services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition\nstrategy, comply with new and evolving regulatory requirements on climate change, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel related\nindustries, our business, access to capital and the market for our securities could be negatively impacted. Investor and regulatory focus on environmental, social and governance\n(“ESG”) matters continues to increase. In addition to climate change, there is increasing attention on topics such as diversity and inclusion, human rights, and human and natural\ncapital, in companies’ own operations as well as their supply chains. In addition, perspectives on the efficacy of ESG considerations continue to evolve, and we cannot currently\npredict how regulators’, investors’ and other stakeholders’ views on ESG matters may affect the regulatory and investment landscape and affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. In addition, our inability to timely address these new and evolving regulatory requirements or pressures may result in regulatory enforcement actions or\nshareholder litigation and otherwise damage our reputation.\nIn March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks and other information. To the extent this rule is finalized as\nproposed, we and/or our customers could incur increased costs related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related information. Enhanced climate disclosure requirements\ncould also accelerate any trend by certain stakeholders and capital providers to restrict or seek more stringent conditions with respect to their financing of certain carbon intensive\nsectors.\nIncreasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our\ncosts or otherwise adversely affect us. For example, shareholder activism has recently been increasing in our industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our\nbusiness or governance to deal with climate change-related issues, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise, which may result in\nsignificant management distraction and potentially significant expense. Additionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. have filed\nlawsuits against energy companies seeking damages allegedly associated with climate change. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. If any such lawsuits were to be\nfiled against us, we could incur substantial legal defense costs and, if any such litigation were adversely determined, we could incur substantial damages. Any of these climate\nchange-related litigation risks could result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions to our business, and increases to our operating expenses, which\nin turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\nand the IRA contain billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and\nsupporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. Also, the EPA has proposed ambitious rules to reduce harmful air pollutant emissions,\nincluding greenhouse gases, from light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles beginning in model year 2027. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of\nGHGs through a methane emissions charge, which will be phased-in starting in 2024. The IRA could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels\ntowards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for our services related to the oil and natural gas industry.\nDeterioration of the commodity price environment can negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and, in some cases, impair their ability to\ntimely pay for products or services provided or result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to credit risk of our oil and natural gas exploration and\nproduction customers.\nIn certain economic and commodity price environments, we may experience increased difficulties, delays or failures in collecting outstanding receivables from our customers,\ndue to, among other reasons, a reduction in their cash flow from\n25\noperations, their inability to access the credit markets and, in certain cases, their insolvencies. Such increases in collection issues could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot assure you that the reserves we have established for potential credit losses will be sufficient to meet\nwrite-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences\nbankruptcy proceedings, as was the case with Gulfport Energy Corporation, our contracts with these customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the\nUnited States Bankruptcy Code, or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the\nbankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nShortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply of major components, replacement parts or, other equipment, supplies or materials may adversely affect our pressure\npumping business.\nDuring periods of increased demand for drilling and completion services, such as those in the second half of 2022 and early 2023, the industry has experienced shortages of\nmajor components, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, replacement parts, engines and other\nequipment, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance\nof expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials and delay or prevent operations. Interruptions may\nbe caused by, among other reasons:\n• weather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane or winter storm, or long-term such as a drought; and\n• shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other\ncustomers or third parties.\nThese price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Severe shortages,\ndelays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our pressure pumping fleets and hinder our ability to execute on our business plan, any\nof which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOilfield services equipment, refurbishment and new asset construction projects, as well as the reactivation of oilfield service assets that have been idle for six months or longer,\nare subject to risks which could cause delays or cost overruns and adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nOilfield services equipment or assets being upgraded, converted or re-activated following a period of inactivity may experience significant start-up costs and complications and\nmay encounter other operational problems that could result in significant delays, uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation, termination or non-renewal of\ncontracts. In this regard, due to market conditions, we have temporarily shut down certain of our service offerings, including contract land drilling, flowback, cementing, acidizing\nand crude oil hauling operations as well as certain of our facilities, such as our sand processing plant in Pierce County, Wisconsin. Further, construction and upgrade projects are\nsubject to risks of delay or significant cost overruns inherent in any large construction project from numerous factors, including the following:\n• shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n• unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard construction;\n• failure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards;\n• financial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors;\n• unanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n• inability by us or our customers to obtain required permits or approvals, or to meet applicable regulatory standards in our areas of operations;\n• unanticipated cost increases between order and delivery;\n• adverse weather conditions and other events of force majeure;\n• design or engineering changes; and\n• work stoppages and other labor disputes.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\n26\nAdvancements in oilfield service technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe oilfield services industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As\nnew horizontal and directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and well service technologies develop, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and\ncompetitive pressure may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. We may not be able to successfully acquire or use new technologies. Further, our customers\nare increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs. There can be no assurance that we will:\n• have sufficient capital resources to build new, technologically advanced equipment and other assets;\n• successfully integrate additional oilfield service equipment and other assets;\n• effectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, equipment and other assets;\n• successfully deploy idle, stacked or additional oilfield service assets;\n• maintain crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs or pressure pumping service equipment; or\n• successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.\nIf we are not successful in building or acquiring new oilfield service equipment and other assets or upgrading our existing rigs and equipment in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, we could lose market share. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, equipment and other assets obsolete, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain specialized equipment and parts from third-party suppliers, and we may be vulnerable to delayed deliveries and future price\nincreases.\nWe purchase specialized equipment and parts from third party suppliers. At times during the business cycle, there is a high demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield\nservices and extended lead times to obtain equipment needed to provide these services. Further, there are a limited number of suppliers that manufacture the equipment we use.\nShould our current suppliers be unable or unwilling to provide the necessary equipment and parts or otherwise fail to deliver the products timely and in the quantities required, any\nresulting delays in the provision of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future\nprice increases for this type of equipment and parts could negatively impact our ability to purchase new equipment to update or expand our existing fleet or to timely repair\nequipment in our existing fleet.\nOur failure to receive payment for contract change orders or adequately recover on claims brought by us against customers related to payment terms and costs could\nmaterially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders\nrelating to such contracts. These types of claims can occur due to, among other things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional\ncosts. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to predict the timing and outcome of such proceedings. Our failure to\npromptly and adequately recover on these types of claims could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with infrastructure services provided under fixed price contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe derive a portion of our infrastructure services revenue from fixed-price master service and other service agreements. Under these contracts, we typically set the price\nof our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that costs associated with our performance may be greater than what we estimated. In addition to master service\nand other service agreements, we enter into contracts for specific projects or jobs that may require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified\nunits within an infrastructure system, which are priced on a per unit basis. Profitability will be reduced if actual costs to complete a project exceed our original estimates. Our\nprofitability is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services and our ability to execute in accordance with our plans. A variety of factors\ncould negatively affect these costs, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the\ncontract and higher than expected costs of materials and labor. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, could cause actual project\nrevenue\n27\nand profits to differ from original estimates, which could result in lower margins than anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings, and the need for performance and surety bonds could reduce availability under\nour credit facility.\nSome of our infrastructure services contracts require performance and payment bonds. If we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future,\nwe may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain\nperformance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds, which would reduce availability under our credit facility. Furthermore,\nunder standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral\nas a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other\nreasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on projects that require bonding.\nThe nature of our infrastructure services business exposes us to potential liability for warranty claims and faulty engineering, which may reduce our profitability.\nUnder some of our infrastructure services contracts with customers, we provide a warranty for the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in\nworkmanship and material. As much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of the project, we have not\nhistorically incurred warranty claims. Additionally, materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects from the supplier. However,\ncertain projects may have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally provide. In these\ncircumstances, if warranty claims occurred, it could require us to re-perform the services or to repair or replace the warranted item, at a cost to us, and could also result in other\ndamages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any\ndefects or failures in materials we provide that we purchase from third parties. While we generally require suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we\nprovide to the customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not\nreimbursed. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur infrastructure services business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of electric power\ntransmission and commercial construction. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable\nprofessional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have\nadopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a significantly adverse or catastrophic event at one of our\nproject sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant warranty, professional liability, or other claims against us as well as\nreputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In\naddition, customers, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim,\neither in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe timing of new contracts and termination of existing contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our cash flows and financial results.\nA portion of our continental United States-based infrastructure services revenue is derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. It is\ngenerally very difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of, or failure to obtain projects, delays in\nawards of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-\nutilization of our assets, which could lower our overall profitability and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether,\nor when, work will begin. This can present difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of\na ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, which could impact our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related work\nrelease is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are\ncontracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments from the customer. Finally, the winding down or\n28\ncompletion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the\ncurrent period.\nMany of our contracts may be canceled upon short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our\ncontracts if they are canceled or as they are completed or expire. We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity if contracts are canceled and if we are\nunable to replace canceled, completed or expired contracts. Certain of our infrastructure services customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under MSAs. Under\nthese agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is\nnot assigned to us or is canceled. Many of our contracts, including our MSAs, are opened to competitive bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will\nbe the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re-bid.\nDelays and reductions in government appropriations can negatively impact energy infrastructure engineering, design, construction, maintenance and repair projects and may\nimpair the ability of our energy infrastructure customers to timely pay for products or services provided or result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to\ncredit risk of our infrastructure customers.\nMany of our infrastructure customers derive funding from federal, state and local bodies. Delayed or reduced appropriations may cancel, curtail or delay projects and may have\nan adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOutcomes of rate cases may impact the capital expenditure budgets of our infrastructure customers and may result in lower demand for our services.\nMany of our infrastructure customers are regulated by governing bodies and the prices they charge their customers are decided through a process called a rate case. A rate\ncase is a formal process, conducted by utility regulators, to determine if the utility’s proposed base rates are just and reasonable. The outcome of rate cases may impact the capital\nexpenditure budgets of our infrastructure customers and, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAn increase in the prices of certain materials used in our businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to market risk of increases in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in\nsome of our infrastructure and pressure pumping businesses. An increase in these materials could increase our operating costs, limit our ability to service our customers’ needs or\notherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nInaccuracies in estimates of volumes and qualities of our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected production costs.\nEstimates of our sand reserves are by nature imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available data, which may prove unreliable. There are\nnumerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates\nof economically recoverable sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n• geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n• assumptions concerning future prices of frac sand, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n• assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nAny inaccuracy in the estimates related to our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs. For example, these estimates assume that\nour revenue and cost structure will remain relatively constant over the life of our reserves. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some or all of our reserves may not be\neconomically mineable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our current customer\ncontracts require us to deliver frac sand that meets certain specifications. If the estimates of the\n29\nquality of our sand reserves, including the volumes of the various specifications of those reserves, prove to be inaccurate, we may incur significantly higher excavation costs\nwithout corresponding increases in revenues, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligations, or our facilities may have a shorter than expected reserve life, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we rely on third parties for raw materials and transportation, and the suspension or termination of our relationship\nwith one or more of these third parties could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we mine and process sand into premium monocrystalline sand, a specialized mineral that is used as a proppant (also\nknown as frac sand) at our Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin plants. We sell natural sand proppant to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to\nenhance the recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. We also provide logistics solutions to deliver our frac sand products to our customers. Because our\ncustomers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities near their job sites, they seek to arrange for product to be delivered where and as needed, which requires\npredictable and efficient loading and shipping of product. To facilitate our logistics and transload facility capabilities, we contract with third party providers to transport our frac\nsand products to railroad facilities for delivery to our customers. We also lease a railcar fleet from various third parties to deliver our frac sand products to our customers and lease\nor otherwise utilize origin and destination transloading facilities. The suspension, termination or nonrenewal of our relationship with any one or more of these third parties involved\nin the sourcing, transportation and delivery of our frac sand products could result in material operational delays, increase our operating costs, limit our ability to service our\ncustomers’ wells or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture performance of our natural sand proppant services business will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to\npotential fluctuations in the demand for and supply of frac sand.\nIn our natural sand proppant services business, we operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number\nof small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer\nservice, reliability of supply and breadth of product offering. The large, national producers with whom we compete include Badger Mining Corporation, Covia Holdings\nCorporation, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Capital Sand Proppants LLC, Athabasca Minerals Inc., Source Energy Services Ltd., and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. Our larger competitors may\nhave greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours, may have production facilities that are located closer to sand mines from which\nraw sand is mined or to their key customers than our facilities or have a more cost effective access to raw sand and transportation facilities than we do. As the demand for hydraulic\nfracturing services has decreased due to commodity price volatility, prices in the frac sand market have materially decreased as demand for frac sand dropped and sand producers\nsought to preserve market share or exit the market and sell frac sand at below market prices. In addition, some oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other\nproviders of hydraulic fracturing services have acquired their own frac sand reserves, developed or expanded frac sand production capacity or otherwise fulfilled their own\nproppant requirements and existing or new frac sand producers could add to or expand their frac sand production capacity, which may negatively impact pricing and demand for\nour frac sand. We may not be able to compete successfully against either our larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our frac sand products could be reduced by changes in well stimulation processes and technologies, as well as changes in governmental regulations and other\napplicable law.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we mine, process and sell frac sand products to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance\nthe recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, or the development of new processes to replace\nhydraulic fracturing altogether, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows. Further, federal and state governments and agencies have adopted various laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations\nthat are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing, a process which utilizes proppants such as those that we produce. Future hydraulic fracturing-related\nlegislation or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to utilize, or increase the cost associated with, hydraulic fracturing, which could reduce demand for our\nproppants and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding the regulation of hydraulic fracturing,\nsee Item 1. Business—Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing included elsewhere in this annual report.\n30\nWe face distribution and logistics challenges in our business.\nIn response to various factors, including fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, our customers may shift their focus among resource plays, some of which can be located in\ngeographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Some geographic areas, including the areas in which our sand facilities are\nlocated, have limited access to railroads. Any interruption or delay in the railroad access or service may affect our ability to ship and/or the timing of shipment of our frac sand to\nour customers, which may adversely affect our revenues or result in increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Serving our\ncustomers in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that may affect our sales and could negatively impact our operating costs. Labor\ndisputes, system constraints, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, an increasingly tight railcar leasing market and changes to rail freight systems,\namong other factors, could interrupt or limit available transportation services, could affect our ability to timely and cost-effectively deliver our frac sand to our customers and could\nprovide a competitive advantage to our competitors located in closer proximity to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistics challenges could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing transportation and related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause of the relatively low cost of producing frac sand, transportation expenses and related costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees,\nrailcar lease costs, demurrage costs and storage fees, comprise a significant component of the total delivered cost of frac sand sales. The relatively high transportation expenses and\nrelated costs tend to favor frac sand producers located in close proximity to their customers. If and when we expand our frac sand production, our need for additional transportation\nservices and transload network access will increase. We contract with truck and rail services to move frac sand from our production facilities to transload sites and our customers,\nand increased costs under these contracts could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we bear the risk of non-delivery under our contracts. A significant increase in\ntransportation service rates, a reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation or transload services, or relocation of our customers’ businesses to areas farther from\nour plants or transloading facilities could impair our ability to deliver our products economically to our customers and our ability to expand into different markets.\nDiminished access to water and inability to secure or maintain necessary permits may adversely affect operations of our frac sand processing plants.\nThe processing of raw sand and production of natural sand proppant require significant amounts of water. As a result, securing water rights and water access is necessary to\noperate our processing facilities. If the areas where our facilities are located experience water shortages, restrictions or any other constraints due to drought, contamination or\notherwise, there may be additional costs associated with securing water access. Although we have obtained water rights to service our activities when we are operating our\nprocessing plants, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities. Such regulatory\nauthorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to\nretain all or a portion of such water rights. If implemented, these new regulations could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations and could have a material\nadverse effect on costs involved in operating our processing plant. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may\nalter the environment in which we do business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, a water\ndischarge permit may be required to properly dispose of water at our processing sites when in operation. Certain of our facilities are also required to obtain storm water permits.\nThe water discharge, storm water or any other permits we may be required to have in order to conduct our frac sand processing operations is subject to regulatory discretion, and\nany inability to obtain or maintain the necessary permits could have an adverse effect on our ability to run such operations.\nSimilar to our natural sand proppant services, certain of our completion and production services, particularly our hydraulic fracturing services, are substantially dependent on\nthe availability of water. Restrictions on our ability, or our customers’ ability, to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. In recent years, certain areas in which\nwe operate have experienced drought conditions and competition for water in such areas is growing. As a result, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water\nsubject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. For example, in 2021, the Texas Legislature directed the Texas Railroad Commission to adopt\nrules encouraging fluid oil and gas waste recycling. In October 2023, the Commission announced draft amendments to its water protection rules to, among other things, encourage\nwaste recycling. Our inability, or\n31\ncustomers’ inability, to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or to effectively utilize flowback water could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe customized nature, and remote location, of the modular camps that we provide and service present unique challenges that could adversely affect our ability to successfully\noperate our remote accommodations business.\nWe rely on a third-party subcontractor to manufacture and install the customized modular units used in our remote accommodations business. These customized units often take\na considerable amount of time to manufacture and, once manufactured, often need to be delivered to remote areas that are frequently difficult to access by traditional means of\ntransportation. In the event we are unable to provide these modular units in a timely fashion, we may not be entitled to full, or any, payment therefor under the terms of our\ncontracts with customers. In addition, the remote location of the modular camps often makes it difficult to install and maintain the units, and our failure, on a timely basis, to have\nsuch units installed and provide maintenance services could result in our breach of, and non-payment by our customers under, the terms of our customer contracts. Any of these\nfactors could have a material adverse effect on our remote accommodation business and our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth and food safety issues and food-borne illness concerns could adversely affect our remote accommodations business.\nWe provide food services to our customers as part of our remote accommodations business and, as a result, face health and food safety issues that are common in the food and\nhospitality industries. Food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past and could\noccur in the future. Our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control.\nNew illnesses resistant to any precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise. Further, the remote nature of our accommodation\nfacilities and related food services may increase the risk of contamination of our food supply and create additional health and hygiene concerns due to the limited access to modern\namenities and conveniences that may not be faced by other food service providers or hospitality businesses operating in an urban environment. If our customers become ill from\nfood-borne illness, we could be forced to close some or all of our remote accommodation facilities on a temporary basis or otherwise. Any such incidents and/or any report of\npublicity linking us to incidents of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our remote accommodations\nbusiness as well as our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of permanent infrastructure in the Canadian oil sands region or other locations where we locate our remote accommodations could negatively impact our remote\naccommodations business.\nOur remote accommodations business specializes in providing modular housing and related services for workforces in remote areas which lack the infrastructure typically\navailable in towns and cities. If significant development activity does not return to the Canadian oil sands region or if permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop\nin the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada or other regions where we locate our modular camps, then demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer\nemployees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services.\nRevenue generated and expenses incurred by our remote accommodation business are denominated in the Canadian dollar and could be negatively impacted by currency\nfluctuations.\nOur remote accommodation business generates revenue and incurs expenses that are denominated in the Canadian dollar. These transactions could be materially affected by\ncurrency fluctuations. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our combined results of operations or financial position. We also maintain cash balances\ndenominated in the Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2023, we had $2.4 million of cash in Canadian dollars, in Canadian accounts. We have not hedged our exposure to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates and, as a result, could incur unanticipated translation gains and losses.\nIn the course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits, indemnity or other claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nIn addition to the investigations and legal proceedings referenced in the risk factors above, from time to time, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal\nproceedings brought or threatened against us in the course of our business. These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury,\nworkers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, indemnity claims, property damage and violation of federal or state\nsecurities laws. We may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour\nlaws.\n32\nClaimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establish accruals for litigation and contingencies that we\nbelieve to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and our indemnity insurance coverages. We reassess our potential liability for litigation and contingencies as\nadditional information becomes available and adjust our accruals as necessary. We could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity if we do not properly estimate the\namount of required accruals for litigation or contingencies, or if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or becomes unavailable, or if our self-insurance liabilities are\nhigher than expected. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the\npotential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or\nproceeding through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims,\nlawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management’s attention from our business or divert resources away from operating our business, and cause us to incur\nsignificant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Please see Note 20. Commitments\nand Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular,\nthe loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer could disrupt our operations. We do not have any written employment agreement with either our\nChief Executive Officer or our Chief Financial Officer at this time. Further, we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are\nnot insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nIf we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nThe delivery of our products and services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result\nof the volatility of the energy services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work\nenvironment at wage rates that are competitive. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our\nability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. As a\nresult, competition for experienced energy service personnel is intense, and we face significant challenges in competing for crews and management with large and well established\ncompetitors. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or\nboth. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nUnionization efforts could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nPresently, none of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. Unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industries, to varying degrees\nof success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nOur operations may be limited or disrupted in certain parts of the continental U.S. and Canada during severe weather conditions, which could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide well completion services and drilling services in the Utica, SCOOP, STACK, Permian Basin, Marcellus, Granite Wash, and Cana Woodford resource plays located\nin the continental U.S. We provide infrastructure services in the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. We provide remote\naccommodation services in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. We serve these markets through our facilities and service centers located in Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin,\nKentucky, California, Colorado, Oregon, Indiana and Alberta, Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated approximately 48% and 45%, respectively,\nof our revenue from our operations in Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Canada where weather conditions may be severe, particularly\nduring winter and spring months. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n• curtailment of services;\n• weather-related damage to equipment resulting in suspension of operations;\n• weather-related damage to our facilities;\n33\n• inability to deliver equipment and materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n• loss of productivity.\nMany municipalities, including those in Ohio and Wisconsin, impose bans or other restrictions on the use of roads and highways, which include weight restrictions on the paved\nroads that lead to our jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This can limit our access to these jobsites and our ability to service wells in these areas. These\nconstraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs in those regions. Weather conditions may\nalso affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the European, Asian and the United States financial\nmarkets and global or national health concerns have contributed to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with\nvolatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have in the past precipitated and may in the future precipitate an economic slowdown.\nConcerns about global economic growth may have a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or\nabroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be sold, which\ncould affect the ability of our customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nPublic health emergencies and resulting adverse economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows.\nPublic health emergencies have caused, and could again cause, a significant reduction in global economic activity, significantly weakening demand for oil and gas, and in\nturn, demand for our products and services. Other effects of public health emergencies have included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the\nglobal financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions\nto customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions; employee impacts from illness; and local and regional closures or lockdowns, including\ntemporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The extent to which our operating and financial results will be and may continue to be affected\nby public health emergencies will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the continued severity and duration of the public health emergencies, including any\nsustained geographic resurgence; the emergence of new variants and strains of a contagious disease or virus; and the success of actions to contain or mitigate the effects of the\npublic health emergency.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nThe occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries,\nincluding continued hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other\nobligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward\npressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations\ncould be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these\nthreats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could limit our ability to grow.\nOur capital budget for 2024 is estimated to be $15 million, depending upon industry conditions and our financial results. We fund our capital expenditures primarily with cash\ngenerated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and other capital\nresources to meet our operating needs and/or maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures which, among other things, may prevent us from acquiring new equipment,\nproperly maintaining our existing equipment or restarting idled businesses or expanding existing operations as demand may warrant. Further, any disruptions or continuing\nvolatility in the global financial markets and rising interest rates due to efforts to curb persistent inflation may lead to a contraction in credit availability and an\n34\nincrease in our cost of capital, which will adversely impact our ability to finance our operations. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage, impair our ability to meet our\noperating needs or interfere with our growth plans. Further, our actual capital expenditures for 2024 or future years could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our\noperating or capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may\ninclude debt financing, joint venture partnerships, sales of assets, sale-leaseback transactions, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We may not be able to obtain\nany such alternative source of capital. We may be required to curtail or eliminate contemplated activities. If we can obtain alternative sources of capital, the terms of such\nalternative may not be favorable to us. In particular, the terms of any debt financing may include covenants that significantly restrict our operations. Our inability to grow as\nplanned may reduce our chances of achieving, maintaining and improving profitability.\nThe growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to various risks, including those relating to difficulties in identifying suitable, accretive acquisition\nopportunities and integrating businesses, assets and personnel, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing for targeted acquisitions and the potential for increased leverage or\ndebt service requirements.\nAs a component of our business strategy, we have pursued and, subject to our liquidity needs, intend to continue to pursue selected, accretive acquisitions of complementary\nassets, businesses and technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n• unanticipated costs and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses, including but not limited to environmental liabilities;\n• difficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and the acquired personnel;\n• limitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business, in order to comply with public reporting\nrequirements;\n• potential losses of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses;\n• inability to commercially develop acquired technologies;\n• risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n• increases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a\ndisproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets\ninto our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations. Furthermore, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industries. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain\nfrom, completing acquisitions. We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity, debt or convertible securities in connection with\nsuch acquisitions. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity or\nconvertible securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms. Even if we have access to\nthe necessary capital, we may be unable to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets.\nOur ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational, financial and management information systems and to attract,\nretain, motivate and effectively manage our employees. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and\ncurrent operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to\nperiod, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the\nscope of our activities, lines of our businesses and our geographic coverage through both organic growth and acquisitions, there will be additional demands on our financial,\ntechnical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of\nunexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the energy services industry, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan.\n35\nIf our intended expansion of our business is not successful, our financial condition, profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may not achieve\nincreases in revenue and profitability that we hope to realize.\nA key element of our business strategy involves the expansion of our services, geographic presence and customer base. These aspects of our strategy are subject to numerous\nrisks and uncertainties, including:\n• an inability to retain or hire experienced crews and other personnel;\n• a lack of customer demand for the services we intend to provide;\n• an inability to secure necessary financing, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants) or technology to successfully execute our expansion plans;\n• shortages of water used in our sand processing operations and our hydraulic fracturing operations;\n• unanticipated delays that could limit or defer the provision of services by us and jeopardize our relationships with existing customers and adversely affect our ability to\nobtain new customers for such services; and\n• competition from new and existing services providers.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in implementing our planned expansion could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize.\nOur liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments\nbecome due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n• the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make\ncertain investments;\n• our debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industries;\n• any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in\nan event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n• our level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate\npurposes; and\n• our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur revolving credit facility and term credit facility provide for fluctuating interest rates, which may increase or decrease our interest expense.\nOur revolving credit facility and term credit facility provide for fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation in the U.S. has been\nrising at its fastest rate in over 40 years, creating inflationary pressure on the cost of services, equipment and other goods in our industries and other sectors and contributing to\nlabor and materials shortages across the supply-chain. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rates eight times for an aggregate increase\nof 4.75 percentage points and may continue increasing benchmark interest rates in the future.\nWe have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on the\nrates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other variable interest rates. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase,\nin which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies or utilities at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are generally highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are price, product\nand service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience,\n36\ntechnology, equipment quality and reputation for safety. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial,\ntechnical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more\ngeographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond\nmore quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Some contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition\nbased on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. The competitive environment may be further intensified by mergers\nand acquisitions among oil and natural gas or utility companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. As a result of competition, we\nmay lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, some exploration and production companies have begun performing hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling on their wells using their own equipment and\npersonnel. Any increase in the development and utilization of in-house fracturing and directional drilling capabilities by our customers could decrease the demand for our oil and\nnatural gas services and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas and energy infrastructure industries, which could expose us to substantial liability and cause us to\nlose customers and substantial revenue.\nOur operations include hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas and energy infrastructure industries, such as equipment defects, vehicle accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts,\nsurface cratering, uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations and various environmental hazards such as oil spills and\nreleases of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. For example, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface\nspillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to\ninjury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory\ninvestigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations. The cost of managing such risks may be significant. The frequency and severity of\nsuch incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our\nservices if they view our environmental or safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater\nfor us than some of our competitors because we sometimes acquire companies that may not have allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and environmental\nmatters and may have a poor environmental and safety record and associated possible exposure. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may suffer.\nAlso, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured\nclaim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional\ninsurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs\nstemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our\ninsurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not\nprovide coverage for all liabilities, and the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates\nwe consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may subject us to substantial liability or require us to take actions that will adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or\notherwise relating to environmental protection and health and safety matters. As part of our business, we handle, transport and dispose of a variety of fluids and substances,\nincluding hydraulic fracturing fluids which can contain hydrochloric acid and certain petrochemicals. This activity poses some risks of environmental liability, including leakage of\nhazardous substances from the wells to surface and subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. We also handle, transport and store these substances. The handling,\ntransportation, storage and disposal of these fluids are regulated by a number of laws, including: the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive\n37\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and other federal and state laws and regulations promulgated\nthereunder. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in\naccordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and\nliability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. We could be\nexposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these and other environmental laws. Such liability is commonly on a strict, joint and\nseveral liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by,\nprior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they are likely to change in the future. If existing environmental\nrequirements or enforcement policies change and become more stringent, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. For a detailed\ndescription of environmental laws and regulations applicable to us and their impact on our operations, see “Item 1. Business—Regulations” above.\nFurther, in connection with providing our infrastructure services, we have made a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes petroleum-based fuel. Any\nchanges in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative fuels could require a significant investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows and liquidity.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water\ngathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the underground injection\nof wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and\ngas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring\nproperties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional\nrequirements related to underground injection activities. For example, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of\nthe National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. The\nTexas Railroad Commission has also implemented measures to assess the potential for seismic activity in the vicinity of disposal wells, and it has restricted and indefinitely\nsuspended disposal well activities in some cases. These restrictions on the disposal of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells could result in\nincreased operating costs, requiring us to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means, all of which could be costly and could adversely impact our results of\noperations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur operations in our natural sand proppant services business are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the\nrequired permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at our production facilities. For our extraction and\nprocessing in Wisconsin, the permitting process is subject to federal, state and local authority. For example, at the federal level, a Mine Identification Request must be filed and\nobtained before mining commences. If wetlands are implicated, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland permit may be required. At the state level, a series of permits are required\nrelated to air quality, wetlands, water quality (waste water and storm water), grading, endangered species and archaeological assessments in addition to other permits depending\nupon site specific factors and operational detail. At the local level, zoning, building, storm water, erosion control, wellhead protection, road usage and access are all regulated and\nrequire permitting to some degree. A non-metallic mining reclamation permit is required. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new\nor renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot\nverify. A successful claim that we do not have title to our property or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop and extract minerals,\nwithout compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event we have title deficiencies.\n38\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A\nthird party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial\ncondition.\nPenalties, fines or sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration could have a material adverse effect on our proppant production and\nsales business and our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, has primary regulatory jurisdiction over commercial silica operations, including quarries, surface mines,\nunderground mines, and industrial mineral process facilities. In addition, MSHA representatives perform at least two annual inspections of our production facilities to ensure\nemployee and general site safety. As a result of these and future inspections and alleged violations and potential violations, we and our suppliers could be subject to material fines,\npenalties or sanctions. Any of our production facilities or our suppliers’ mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of an alleged MSHA violation.\nAny such penalties, fines or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our proppant production and sales business and our overall financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn connection with our business operations, including the transportation and relocation of our energy service equipment, shipment of frac sand and general freight hauling, we\noperate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States\nDepartment of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor\ncarrier operations, driver licensing, insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous\nmaterials (HAZMAT). Our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include\nincreasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period,\nonboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United\nStates Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Matters such as the\nweight and dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase\nfederal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what\nform, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nCertain motor vehicle operators require registration with the Department of Transportation. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The Department of\nTransportation periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria that could result in a suspension of\noperations.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and\nenergy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, resulting in reduced demand for oilfield services. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas\nservices and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flow.\nWe are subject to tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise\ntaxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that\ncould result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may\nsubject us to interest and penalties.\nOur income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the applicable tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be\ndisallowed upon\n39\nchallenge by a tax authority. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from\nour historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the periods for which the\napplicable final determinations are made.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nThe operational insurance coverage we maintain for our business may not fully insure us against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high\npremium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, any insurance obtained by us may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities and this insurance may not continue to be\navailable at all or on terms which are acceptable to us. Insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage,\nincreases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate with most of our customers under master service agreements, or MSAs. We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in the MSAs.\nGenerally, under our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, we assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, pollution or contamination\nwhich originates above surface and originates from our equipment or services. Our customer assumes responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or\ncontamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling fluids. We may have liability in such\ncases if we are negligent or commit willful acts. Generally, our customers also agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees’ personal injury or death to the\nextent that, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, their employees are injured or their properties are damaged by such operations, unless resulting from our gross\nnegligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless\nresulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. In addition, our customers generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned\nproperty or equipment and in turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own. Losses due to catastrophic events, such as\nblowouts, are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might\nincur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a\nresult, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs. If our programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or\nsoftware network infrastructure, whether due to cyberattack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process\ncommercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. Cyber incidents or intrusions may result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nOur operations have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform\nmany of our services and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased.\nThe U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and\nthose of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, have been and could continue to be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the\nunauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain\ncyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our security programs and measures, as well as security programs of our customers, suppliers,\nor other third parties, may not prevent all intrusions and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents\ncontinue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our\n40\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Laws and regulations governing cybersecurity, data privacy, and the unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential or protected information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties and legal\nliability. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.\nIncreased regulation by state and federal governments related to cybersecurity protections and disclosures may require additional resources for compliance, and any\ninability, or perceived inability, to adequately address new requirements could subject us to regulatory enforcement, private litigation, public criticism, disrupt our operations,\ncause us to lose customers, result in additional costs and legal liability, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nRisks Inherent to Our Common Stock\nOur largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nWexford, through its affiliate MEH Sub LLC, beneficially owns approximately 47.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Wexford can exercise significant influence\nover matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. Further, individuals\nwho serve as our directors are affiliates of Wexford. This concentration of ownership and relationship with Wexford makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of\nour common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in related party\ntransactions involving Wexford, and certain companies they control. The interests of Wexford with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as\nservices provided, future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities, and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This\nconcentrated ownership will make it impossible for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares unless these stockholders\napprove the acquisition.\nA significant reduction by Wexford of its ownership interests in us could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that Wexford’s substantial ownership interest in us provides it with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. Wexford is not subject to any obligation to\nmaintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us. If Wexford sells all or a\nsubstantial portion of its ownership interest in us, it may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign.\nSuch actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to continue comply with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance\nare significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting\nunder Section 404 of the Sarbanes Act of 2002. As we perform the required testing of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify areas requiring improvement,\nand we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of\nmanagement’s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our auditors identify material weaknesses in internal control over\nfinancial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in\nour reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional\nexpenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable Wexford or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might\notherwise be available to us.\n41\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n• permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;\n• permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make\ninvestments; and\n• provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction\nor other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will\nhave no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer\nwill not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a\nmanner inconsistent with our best interests.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not\nalways be in our or our common stockholders’ best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies. As described elsewhere in this report, including in the notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements, these transactions include, among others, a joint venture, agreements to provide our services and frac sand products to our affiliates and\nagreements pursuant to which our affiliates provide us with facilities. Each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with Wexford, as the case may be, and the resolution\nof any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions, including pricing, duration or other terms of service, may not always be in our or our\nstockholders’ best interests because Wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts. For a discussion of potential conflicts, see “—Risks Inherent to Our\nCommon Stock—Our largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.”\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active public market for our common stock may not be maintained. If an active public market for\nour common stock is not maintained, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. Without a large float, our common stock is less\nliquid than the securities of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. The market price for our\ncommon stock has fluctuated significantly, ranging from a high of $8.74 per share to a low of $3.41 per share during 2023. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading\nmarket, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. In addition, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our\ncommon stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n• our quarterly or annual operating results;\n• changes in our earnings estimates;\n• investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industries;\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n• our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts’ projections;\n• changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n• announcements of legislative or regulatory change.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies,\nincluding companies in our industries. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based\nupon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price for our common stock.\nWexford beneficially owns a substantial amount of our common stock and may sell such common stock in the public or private markets. Sales of these shares of common stock\nor sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by other\n42\nstockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Wexford beneficially owned 47.1% shares of our common stock. Sales of these shares of common stock or sales of substantial amounts of our\ncommon stock by other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could\nimpair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely revise their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating\nresults do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If analysts cease\ncoverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to\ndecline. Moreover, if analysts who cover our company downgrades our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations,\npreferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The\nterms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred\nstock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or\nredemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company, which could adversely affect\nthe price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if\nthat change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult,\nincluding:\n• provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n• limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;\n• the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the\nvoting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws;\n• the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove\ndirectors;\n• the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend\nour certificate of incorporation; and\n• the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result,\nthese provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to\npay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by\nour stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n43\n• Any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n• Any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n• Any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\n• Any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that if any action specified above (each is referred to herein as a covered proceeding), is filed in a court other than the\nspecified Delaware courts without the approval of our board of directors (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to\n(i) the personal jurisdiction of the specified Delaware courts in connection with any action brought in any such courts to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and\n(ii) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such\nclaiming party. These provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other\nemployees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of\nincorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other\njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe declaration of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee\nthat we will pay any dividends in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\nOn July 16, 2018, our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend policy on shares of our common stock payable quarterly beginning with the second quarter of 2018.\nIn July 2019, as a result of oilfield market conditions and other factors, which included the status of collections from PREPA, our board of directors suspended the quarterly cash\ndividend. The decision to pay dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors’ determination with respect to\nany such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual\nrestrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the\nboard of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, or declare dividends at rates that are less than anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.\nOur ability to repurchase stock may be limited and no assurance can be given that we will be able to effectuate our stock repurchase program in the future at indicated levels\nor at all.\nOn August 10, 2023, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we would be authorized to repurchase up to the lesser of $55 million\nor 10 million shares of its common stock, subject to the factors discussed below. Following the completion of the refinancing transactions discussed in this report, any stock\nrepurchases under this program may be made opportunistically from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the\nSecurities Act of 1934, as amended, including any 10b5-1 plan, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal and contractual restrictions, liquidity requirements and\nother factors. The repurchase program has no time limit, does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time, modified or\ndiscontinued by our board of directors at any time. Any common stock repurchased as part of such stock repurchase program will be cancelled and retired. No assurance can be\ngiven that we will effectuate stock buybacks in the future, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have not repurchased any shares\nof our common stock under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2023 or to date.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n44\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. To assess and manage cybersecurity risks impacting our industry and our business, we have implemented and invested\nin, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify\nand remediate vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure on a regular basis and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats. As part of\nour cybersecurity risk management program, we have a designated in-house team principally responsible for managing cybersecurity risk assessment processes, security controls\nand response to cybersecurity incidents or intrusions. We have also engaged third-party consultants to conduct penetration testing and risk assessments.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, using common methodologies, reporting channels and\ngovernance processes that apply to other risks managed by our organization, including operational, financial and strategic risks, as well as applicable legal and regulatory risks.\nOur cybersecurity governance program is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and measured by the\nMaturity and Risk Assessment Ratings associated with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Capability Maturity Model Integration. In addition, our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement program includes processes to assess cybersecurity risks related to third-party vendors and suppliers.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur cybersecurity team consists of in-house cybersecurity professionals and external threat analysts, consultants and service providers. Our in-house professionals and\nexternal threat analysts possess various cybersecurity certifications, including Security +, Network +, A + and Server + certifications.\nOur internal cybersecurity governance program is led by Mammoth’s Director of Information Technology, with support from the internal information technology\ndepartment, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer. Our Director of\nInformation Technology has over six years of technological leadership experience along with an extensive background in computer support and application support. The Director\nof Information Technology and her team are responsible for leading cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes within our organization. In addition, our\ncybersecurity incident response team is responsible for responding to cybersecurity incidents. This team continuously identifies potential cyber vulnerabilities and opportunities for\nimprovement, including yearly security training for all employees. This team also continuously evaluates and implements technological enhancements as part of our cybersecurity\nsystems. Progress and developments in our cybersecurity governance program are regularly communicated to our executive team. Our board of directors, as part of its oversight\nprocess, receives quarterly updates on the status of our cybersecurity governance program, including as related to new or developing initiatives and any security incidents that have\noccurred.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, incidents or intrusions have not thus far materially affected, and are not currently anticipated to materially affect, our Company,\nincluding our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See, however, Item 1.A, Risk Factors—“We are subject to cyber security risks. Cyber incidents or\nintrusions may result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss” for additional information regarding cybersecurity risks we face and their\npotential impact on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our internal audit function, in conjunction with third-party experts, plays a key role in reviewing and assessing our cybersecurity technologies, controls and\nprocedures. Our security programs and measures may not prevent all incidents or intrusions and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may\nnot be sufficient. As cybersecurity risks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to\ninvestigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents or intrusions. Laws and regulations governing cybersecurity, data privacy, and the unauthorized disclosure of\nconfidential or protected information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties and legal liability. Our\ninsurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.\n45\nItem 2. Properties\nOverview of Sand Properties and Operations\nInformation concerning our mining properties in this annual report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which first\nbecame applicable to us for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. These requirements differ significantly from the previously applicable disclosure requirements of SEC\nIndustry Guide 7. Among other differences, subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, as of the end of our\nmost recently completed fiscal year both in the aggregate and for each of our individually material mining properties.\nAs used in this annual report, the terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource,” “inferred mineral resource,” “mineral reserve,”\n“proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are defined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral\nresources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that the mineral resources can be the basis of an economically\nviable project. You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits (including any mineral resources) in these categories will ever be converted\ninto mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. You are further cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not\nhave demonstrated economic value.\nThe information that follows is derived, in part, from the technical report summary prepared by John T. Boyd Company in February 2022, our third-party mining and\ngeological consultant and an external qualified person, (“John T. Boyd”), in compliance with Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. As of December 31, 2023, in\nthe opinion of John T. Boyd, there were no material changes in mineral (frac sand) resources/mineral (frac sand) reserves, material assumptions or other technical information from\nthose reported in the February 2022 technical report. As a result, we are relying on the February 2022 technical report, as updated by John T. Boyd for immaterial changes in our\nreserves/resources as of December 31, 2023. Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are summarized here and are\ndescribed in more detail in the technical report. Reference should be made to the full text of the technical report summary, incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this\nannual report.\nOur natural sand proppant business mines, processes and sells high quality Northern White silica, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells, which we refer to\nas frac sand. Northern White frac sand deposits are generally located in the north-central portion of the United States (predominantly in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, with\nlesser amounts in Arkansas and Iowa). Northern White frac sand is found in poorly cemented Cambrian and Ordovician sandstones and in unconsolidated alluvial deposits locally\nderived from these sandstones. All of our frac sand facilities are located in Wisconsin, with our Taylor facilities located in Jackson County, our Piranha facilities located in Barron\nCounty and our Muskie facilities located in Pierce County.\n46\nOur frac sand facilities consist of three dry plants with a total permitted capacity of 5.7 million tons of sand per year, and two wet plants, with a total permitted capacity of\n8.7 million tons of sand per year, that supply two of the dry plants with Northern White silica sand, which we believe is some of the highest quality raw frac sand available. Our\nMuskie plant in Pierce County, Wisconsin is currently idled. Our frac sand facilities operate seasonally from March or April through October or November depending on both\nweather and material demand.\nWe produce predominantly 20/40-mesh, 30/50-mesh and 40/70-mesh frac sand. The production of our frac sand consists of three basic processes: mining, wet plant operations\nand dry plant operations. All mining activities take place in an open pit environment, whereby we remove the topsoil, which is set aside, and then remove other non-economic\nminerals, or “overburden,” to expose the sand deposits. A third-party contractor then “bumps” the sand using explosives on the mine face,\n47\nwhich causes the sand to fall into the pit, where it is then carried by truck or conveyor to the wet plant operations. At our wet plants, the mined sand goes through a series of\nprocesses designed to separate the sand from unusable materials. The resulting wet sand is then conveyed to a wet sand stockpile where most of the water is allowed to drain into\nour on-site recycling facility, while the remaining fine grains and materials, if any, are separated through a series of settlement ponds. We reuse the water that does not evaporate in\nour wet process. Wet sand from our stockpile is then conveyed or trucked to our dry plants where the sand is dried, screened into specific mesh categories and stored in silos. From\nthe silos, we load sand directly into railcars or trucks, which we then ship to one of our transloading facilities or directly to our customers. For information regarding our\ntransloading facilities and shipping capabilities, see “Item 1. Business-Our Services-Natural Sand Proppant Services.”\nOur Wisconsin dry plants are enclosed facilities capable of running year-round, regardless of the weather. Under normal market conditions, we typically operate our plants with\nwork crews of ten to 15 employees. These crews typically work 40-hour weeks, with shifts between eight and twelve hours, depending on the employee’s function. Because raw\nsand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, we typically mine and wet-process sand eight months out of the year at our Taylor and Piranha locations. Our\nMuskie location has an indoor wash facility, which is capable of being run year-round.\nOur Taylor and Piranha mines are located in western Wisconsin, near an estimated combined population of over 350,000 people. Both sites are accessible via a well-developed\nnetwork of primary and secondary roads, which offer direct access to the mines and processing facilities and are open year-round. Our Taylor facilities have access to the Canadian\nNational rail network, while our Piranha facilities have access to the Union Pacific rail network. Both operations have readily available access to requisite electrical power, natural\ngas and water. Each of our facilities undergoes regular maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and to ensure that the quality of our frac sand meets API standards and our\ncustomers’ specifications. In addition, we make capital investments in our facilities as required to support customer demand, and our performance goals.\nThe following table provides information regarding our aggregate sand mined for December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nTotal Sand Mined\n(Thousands of Tons)\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPlant Location\nTaylor in Jackson County, Wisconsin 608 630 567\nPiranha in Barron County, Wisconsin 696 766 320\nTotal 1,304 1,396 887\nMineral Resources and Reserves\nThe quantity and nature of our mineral resources and reserves are estimated by John T. Boyd, while we internally track depletion rate on an interim basis. Estimates of frac sand\nreserves for the Taylor mine and Piranha mine were derived contemporaneously with estimates of frac sand resources. To derive an estimate of saleable product tons (proven and\nprobable frac sand reserves), the following modifying factors were applied to the in-place measured and indicated frac sand resources underlying the respective mine plan areas:\n• A 90% mining recovery factor, which assumes that 10% of the mineable (in-place) frac sand resource will not be recovered during mining for various reasons. Applying this\nrecovery factor to the in-place resource results in the estimated sand tonnage that will be delivered to the wet process plant.\n• An overall 79% processing recovery. This recovery factor accounts for losses in the wet and dry plants. This recovery factor accounts for removal of out-sized (i.e., larger\nthan 20-mesh and smaller than 100-mesh) sand and losses in the wet and dry processing plants due to minor inefficiencies.\nWe do not have any reportable frac sand resources excluding those converted to frac sand proven reserves for the Taylor and Piranha mines. Any frac sand within the\ndefined boundaries of the Taylor and Piranha mines which is not reported as frac sand reserves are not considered to have potential economic viability. Therefore, they are not\nreportable as frac sand resources. Further, as we do not own any mineral rights for the Muskie properties, but, rather, own only the surface rights to the processing plants, we do not\n(and do not expect to ever) report any reserves attributable to our Muskie property. John T. Boyd updates our reserve estimates annually, making necessary adjustments for\noperations at each location during the year and\n48\nadditions or surveying, drill core analysis and other tests to confirm the quantity and quality of the reserves. The following table presents our estimated frac sand reserves for the\nTaylor and Piranha mines as of December 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands):\nMine Reserves Category Total Reserves(1)(2)\nTaylor Proven 23,191\nPiranha Proven 36,706\nTotal 59,897\n1. Pricing data based on the weighted average projected sales price for sand of $19.73 per ton for Taylor’s operations and $18.59 for Piranha’s operations.\n2. John T. Boyd has determined that all reportable mineral resources for the Taylor and Piranha mines are categorized as proven reserves as the areas are well explored and\nexhibit acceptable drill hole data spacing to be classified as measured resources.\nWe categorize our sand properties in accordance with the SEC definition in Item 1300 of Regulation S-K. Our mineral resources are concentration or occurrence of\nmaterial of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is\na reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity that, with the assumed and\njustifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an inventory of all mineralization drilled or\nsampled. Our sand reserves are our estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the\nbasis of an economically viable project. More specifically, they are the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials\nand allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.\nJohn T. Boyd updates our reserve estimates annually, making necessary adjustments for operations at each location during the year and additions or surveying, drill core\nanalysis and other tests to confirm the quantity and quality of the reserves. To opine as to the economic viability of our reserves, John T. Boyd reviewed our financial cost and\nrevenue per ton data at the time of the proven reserve determination. Our 2023 average monthly sales prices ranged from approximately $20 to $32 per ton free on board mine.\nBased on its review of our cost structure and its extensive experience with similar operations, John T. Boyd concluded that it is reasonable to assume that we will operate under a\nsimilar cost structure over the remaining life of our reserves. Based on these assumptions, and taking into account possible cost increases associated with a maturing mine, John T.\nBoyd concluded that our current operating margins are sufficient to expect continued profitability throughout the life of our reserves.\nOur proppant sand reserves consist of Northern White silica sand, giving us access to a range of high-quality sand grades meeting or exceeding all API specifications,\nincluding a mix between concentrations of coarse grades (20/40 and 30/50 mesh sands) and finer grades (40/70 and 100 mesh). Our sample boring data and our historical\nproduction data have indicated that our reserves contain deposits of approximately 40% 40 mesh or coarser substrate. The coarseness and conductivity of Northern White frac sand\nsignificantly enhances recovery of oil and liquids-rich gas by allowing hydrocarbons to flow more freely than is sometimes possible with native sand. The low acid-solubility\nincreases the integrity of Northern White frac sand relative to other proppants with higher acid-solubility, especially in shales where hydrogen sulfide and other acidic chemicals are\nco-mingled with the targeted hydrocarbons. In addition, its crush resistant properties enable Northern White frac sand to be used in deeper drilling applications than the frac sand\nproduced from many native mineral deposits. We believe that the coarseness, conductivity, sphericity, acid-solubility and crush-resistant properties of our Northern White sand\nreserves and our facilities’ connectivity to rail and other transportation infrastructure afford us an advantage over our competitors and make us one of a select group of sand\nproducers capable of delivering high volumes of frac sand that is optimal for oil and natural gas production to all major unconventional resource basins currently producing\nthroughout North America.\nSurface and Mineral Rights\nFor each of our Taylor and Piranha frac sand facilities, we own surface and mineral rights. For our Muskie sand facility, we own surface rights.\nIndividual Properties\nTaylor. Our Taylor operation is located less than one mile northwest of the town of Taylor, in Jackson County, Wisconsin and encompasses a total of approximately 393\nacres. Approximately 148 acres of frac sand resources remain on this\n49\nproperty. We own in fee numerous land parcels which comprise the processing plant site, mineral resource areas and rail loadout facility. Our rail loadout facility, located in\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, is approximately two miles southwest of the mine and processing facility. Our Taylor operation commenced mining operations in 2012. We\nacquired the Taylor operation in June 2017 when we acquired Sturgeon Acquisitions, LLC. The total net book value of the Taylor operation’s real property and fixed assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023, was $24.2 million.\nThe site contains a mine with 23.2 million tons of proven recoverable proppant sand reserves as of December 31, 2023, based on estimates prepared by John T. Boyd. Our\nTaylor wet plant can currently process up to 2.6 million tons of wet frac sand per year. Our Taylor dry plant is adjacent to our Taylor wet plant and wash facilities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the dry plant had a rated production capacity of 2.2 million tons per year. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 2.2 million tons per year of\nfinished product. The Taylor facility includes a 150 ton per hour natural gas fluid bed dryer and a 100 ton per hour natural gas fluid bed dryer as well as nine high-capacity\nscreeners that are capable of producing 2.2 million tons of frac sand per year. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our Taylor facility produced 0.6 million tons of finished\nsand product. Our finished product is transported via truck to our transloading facility with rail access.\nWe estimate an overall product yield (after mining and processing losses) of approximately 66% for the Taylor mine. John T. Boyd utilized post December 31, 2017\nproduction data we provided, along with the John T. Boyd January 2019 Report amending the resource tons as of December 31, 2017, to reconcile the amended estimate from the\nDecember 31, 2017 estimate to December 31, 2023. The following table presents a summary of our mineral reserves for the Taylor mine as of December 31, 2023, together with a\ncomparison to the reserves as of the end of the preceding fiscal year and an explanation of any material changes.\n50\nTaylor Mine – Summary of Reserves(1)(2) (Thousands of Tons)\nAmount as of\nReserves Category December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change % Change\nProven 23,191 23,822 (631) (3) %\n1. Pricing data based on the weighted average projected sales price for sand of $19.73 per ton.\n2. John T. Boyd has determined that all reportable mineral resources for the Taylor mine are categorized as proven reserves as the area is well explored and exhibit acceptable\ndrill hole data spacing to be classified as a measured resource.\nThe decrease from 2022 to 2023 is primarily attributed to depletion by mining 0.6 million tons of sand.\nPiranha. Our Piranha operation is located approximately five miles northwest of the town of New Auburn, in Baron County, Wisconsin and encompasses a total of\napproximately 608 acres. The current estimated mineable area is approximately 313 acres, or 52% of the total property, after observing setbacks, right of ways, processing areas\nand other non-mining acreage. We own 100% of the surface and mineral rights. Our dry plant and loadout is also located in Baron County and is approximately one mile east of the\nmine and wet processing facility. We acquired the Piranha operation on May 26, 2017 from Chieftain Sand and Proppant LLC (Chieftain). Under Chieftain, the property\ncommenced mining operations in August 2012. In January 2018, we purchased the Conoboy tract, which is adjacent to a tract of land previously mined by Chieftain. The total net\nbook value of the Piranha operation’s real property and fixed assets as of December 31, 2023 was $13.4 million.\nThe site contains 36.7 million tons of proven recoverable proppant sand reserves as of December 31, 2023, based on estimates prepared by John T. Boyd. Our Piranha wet\nplant, which is adjacent to the mine, can process up to 4.7 million tons of wet sand per year and is located two miles from our Piranha dry plant, to which we have year-round\ntrucking access. As of December 31, 2023, the dry plant facility had a rated production capacity of 2.6 million tons per year. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 3.5\nmillion tons per year of finished product. Our Piranha facility includes a 150 ton per hour natural\n51\ngas fired fluid bed dryer and a 200 ton per hour natural gas fluid bed dryer as well as seven high-capacity screeners capable of producing 2.6 million tons of frac sand per year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, our Piranha facility produced 0.7 million tons of sand. Our finished product is loaded directly into railcars. Our Piranha facility is\ncapable of storing up to 400 railcars.\nWe estimate an overall product yield (after mining and processing losses) of approximately 71% for the Piranha mine. John T. Boyd utilized post March 31, 2017\nproduction data we provided, in conjunction with other data, to reconcile the estimate from the March 31, 2017 volumetric estimate to December 31, 2023. The following table\npresents a summary of our mineral reserves for the Piranha mine as of December 31, 2023, together with a comparison to the reserves as of the end of the preceding fiscal year and\nan explanation of any material changes.\nPiranha Mine – Summary of Reserves(1)(2) (Thousands of Tons)\nAmount as of\nReserves Category December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change % Change\nProven 36,706 37,351 (645) (2) %\n1.

Our Muskie facilities are located in Plum City, Wisconsin and encompass a total of approximately 40 acres. Although this plant is currently idled, our Muskie wet\nplant can process up to 1.3 million tons of wet sand per year. The site includes an indoor facility capable of washing sand year-round and an enclosed dry plant facility that has a\nrated production capacity of 2,400 tons per day. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 0.9 million tons per year of finished product. The facility has a 100 ton per hour\nnatural gas fired fluid bed dryer as well as six high-capacity screeners that are capable of producing 0.9 million tons per year. As a result of adverse market conditions, production\nat our Muskie facility has been temporarily idled since September 2018. When operating, our finished product is transported via truck to a third-party facility with rail access. The\nsite does not contain any proppant sand reserves. Our Muskie facility commenced operations in 2012. Muskie was contributed to Mammoth in November 2014. The total net book\nvalue of the Muskie operation’s real property and fixed assets as of December 31, 2023, was $5.2 million.\nHeadquarters\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 14201 Caliber Drive, Suite 300, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73134. We currently own 12 properties, four located in Wisconsin,\nfour located in Ohio, three located in Texas and one located in Oklahoma, which are used for field offices, yards, production plants or housing. In addition to our headquarters, we\nalso lease 24 properties that are used for field offices, yards or transloading facilities for frac sand. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to, or the subject of, certain investigations and legal proceedings discussed elsewhere in this annual report. For a description of such investigations and legal\nproceedings, see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks\nRelated to Our Business and the Industries We Serve—Cobra, one of our infrastructure services subsidiaries, was party to service contracts with PREPA. Due to PREPA’s\nbankruptcy proceedings, PREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the FEMA or other sources. In the event that\nPREPA does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.” and\n“—The outcomes of investigations and litigation relating to our contracts with PREPA may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows.”\nIn addition, due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, also involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities,\nincluding workers’ compensation claims and employment related disputes.\n52\nExcept as described in Note 20, Item 1A referenced above and elsewhere in this annual report, in the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes\nor claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nOur operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which\nimposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures,\noperating equipment and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations. Following\npassage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining\noperations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required\nby Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this\nReport.\n53\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information and Holders of Record\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “TUSK.” As of the close of business on February 28, 2024, there were 83 holders of record\nof our common stock. The number of holders of record of our common stock is not representative of the number of beneficial holders because many of the shares are held by\ndepositories, brokers or nominees.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 10, 2023, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we would be authorized to repurchase up to the lesser of $55 million or 10\nmillion shares of its common stock, subject to the factors discussed below. Following the completion of the refinancing transactions discussed in this report, any stock repurchases\nunder this program may be made opportunistically from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Act of\n1934, as amended, including any 10b5-1 plan, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal and contractual restrictions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The\nrepurchase program has no time limit, does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time, modified or discontinued by our\nboard of directors at any time. Any common stock repurchased as part of such stock repurchase program will be cancelled and retired. We have not repurchased any shares of our\ncommon stock under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2023 or to date. See also Item 1.A. “Risk Factors--Our ability to repurchase stock may be limited and no\nassurance can be given that we will be able to effectuate our stock repurchase program in the future at indicated levels or at all.”\nDividends\nOn July 16, 2018, we initiated a quarterly dividend policy and declared our first quarterly cash dividend. In July 2019, as a result of oilfield market conditions and other factors,\nwhich included the status of collections from PREPA, our board of directors suspended the quarterly cash dividend.\nOur board of directors’ determination with respect to any future dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed\nby applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine\nnot to declare a dividend, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\n54\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends\nthat may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking\nstatements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this\nannual report.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented energy services company focused on providing products and services to enable the exploration and development of North American\nonshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserve as well as the construction and repair of the electric grid for private utilities, public investor-owned utilities and co-operative\nutilities through our infrastructure services businesses. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic growth\nopportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes well completion services, infrastructure services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other\nservices. Our well completion services division provides hydraulic fracturing, sand hauling and water transfer services. Our infrastructure services division provides engineering,\ndesign, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells\nnatural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division currently provides rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical\nand horizontal drilling. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide aviation services, equipment rentals, crude oil hauling services, remote accommodations and\nequipment manufacturing. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from\nunconventional resources as well as in maintaining and improving electrical infrastructure. Our complementary suite of services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our\nservices and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nThe growth of our industrial businesses is ongoing. We offer infrastructure engineering services focused on the transmission and distribution industry and also have equipment\nmanufacturing operations and offer fiber optic services. Our equipment manufacturing operations provide us with the ability to repair much of our existing equipment in-house, as\nwell as the option to manufacture certain new equipment we may need in the future. Our fiber optic services include the installation of both aerial and buried fiber. We are\ncontinuing to explore other opportunities to expand our industrial business lines.\nOur revenues, operating (loss) income and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: well completion services; infrastructure services;\nnatural sand proppant services; and drilling services. Prior to 2023, we included Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking, in our drilling segment. Based on our assessment of\nFASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, guidance at December 31, 2023, we changed our presentation in 2023 to move Bison Trucking to the reconciling column titled “All Other”.\nThe results for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change.\nWell Completion Services Segment\n• Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC—March 2012\n• Silverback Energy LLC—November 2012\n• Redback Pump Down Services LLC—January 2015\n• Mr. Inspections LLC—January 2015\n• Mammoth Equipment Leasing LLC—November 2016\n• Bison Sand Logistics LLC—January 2018\n• Aquahawk Energy LLC—June 2018\nInfrastructure Services Segment\n• Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra—January 2017\n• Lion Power Services LLC, formerly Cobra Energy LLC—January 2017\n• Higher Power Electrical LLC—April 2017\n• 5 Star Electric LLC—July 2017\n• Python Equipment LLC—December 2018\n• Aquawolf LLC—September 2019\n• Falcon Fiber Solutions LLC—May 2021\n55\nNatural Sand Proppant Services Segment\n• Muskie Proppant LLC—September 2011\n• Barracuda Logistics LLC—October 2014\n• Piranha Proppant LLC—May 2017\n• Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC—June 2017\n• Taylor Frac, LLC—June 2017\n• Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC—June 2017\n• South River Road, LLC—June 2017\nDrilling Services Segment\n• Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC—November 2010\n• Panther Drilling Systems LLC—December 2012\nOther\n• Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd.—October 2007\n• Redback Energy Services, LLC—October 2011\n• Redback Coil Tubing, LLC—May 2012\n• Bison Trucking—August 2013\n• Anaconda Rentals LLC, formerly White Wing Tubular Services LLC—September 2014\n• WTL Oil LLC, or WTL, formerly Silverback—June 2016\n• Mammoth Energy Services Inc.—June 2016\n• Mammoth Energy Partners, LLC—October 2016\n• Mako Acquisitions LLC—March 2017\n• Stingray Energy Services LLC, or Stingray Energy Services—June 2017\n• Stingray Cementing LLC—June 2017\n• Tiger Shark Logistics LLC—October 2017\n• Cobra Aviation Services LLC—January 2018\n• Black Mamba Energy LLC—March 2018\n• Stingray Cementing and Acidizing LLC, formerly RTS Energy Services LLC—June 2018\n• Ivory Freight Solutions LLC—July 2018\n• IFX Transport LLC—December 2018\n• Air Rescue Systems LLC (“ARS”)—December 2018 through July 13, 2023\n• Leopard Aviation LLC—April 2019\n• Anaconda Manufacturing LLC—September 2019\nOn July 13, 2023, the Company sold its equity interests in ARS.

See “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures” below for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\n• Reduced debt by $40.7 million from $83.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to $42.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n• Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\n• On August 10, 2023, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to the lesser of $55 million or 10\nmillion shares of our common stock, subject to liquidity considerations and other factors. No shares have yet been repurchased under this stock repurchase program. See\n“—Repurchase Program Authorization” below.\n• On October 16, 2023, we entered into the new revolving credit facility and the new term credit facility, in each case maturing on the specified date in 2028, subject to the\nterms and conditions thereof, which facilities refinanced in full\n56\nour indebtedness outstanding under the then existing credit facility. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Credit\nFacility” for additional information regarding the new revolving credit facility and the new term loan.\n• On December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with SPCP Group, LLC (“SPCP\nGroup”). Under the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, Cobra transferred to SPCP Group all of its rights, title and interest in $54.4 million of outstanding\naccounts receivable with PREPA and received net proceeds of $46.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect to the outstanding\nPREPA receivable. Of the $64.0 million, $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s\nand Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated. The remaining $9.6 million was paid to Cobra.\nOverview of Our Industries\nOil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and\ninternational supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices,\nproduction depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services\nand products budgets. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries,\ngovernment regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, storage capacity, shortages of equipment and\nmaterials and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The levels\nof capital expenditures of our customers are driven by many factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas. In March and April 2020, concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic\nand quarantine orders in the U.S. and worldwide, oil prices dropped sharply to below zero dollars per barrel for the first time in history due to factors including significantly\nreduced demand and a shortage of storage facilities. In 2021, U.S. oil production stabilized as commodity prices increased and demand for crude oil rebounded. We saw\nimprovements in the oilfield services industry and in both pricing and utilization of our well completion and drilling services during 2022. Throughout 2023, pricing for crude oil\nand natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022, which slowed down completion activities for our customers, in particular, in the Utica and Marcellus Shale natural gas plays,\nand, as a result, reduced demand for our well completion services. These factors have continued into the first quarter of 2024. Despite this near-term softness, however, we are\nseeing indications that activity levels will begin to ramp back up in mid-2024, creating the opportunity to reactivate additional fleets, if appropriate. The ongoing war in Ukraine\nand the recent Israel-Hamas war, however, could continue to have an adverse impact on the global energy markets and volatility of commodity prices, which could further\nadversely impact demand for our well completion services.\nIn response to market conditions, we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations and flowback operations beginning in July 2019, our contract drilling\noperations beginning in December 2019, our rig hauling operations beginning in April 2020, our coil tubing, pressure control and full service transportation operations beginning in\nJuly 2020 and our crude oil hauling operations beginning in July 2021. We continue to monitor the market to determine if and when we can recommence these services.\nNatural Sand Proppant Industry\nWe experienced a significant decline in demand of our sand proppant in the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020 as a result of completion activity falling due to lower\noil demand and pricing, increased capital discipline by our customers, budget exhaustion and the COVID-19 pandemic. Activity rebounded modestly in 2021 and continued to\nincrease throughout 2022 as we saw an increase in the volume of sand sold. Supply constraints from labor shortages negatively affected West Texas in-basin mine operations and\nincreased demand for Northern White frac sand for the region in 2022. Demand from oil and gas companies in Western Canada and the Marcellus Shale was also strong in 2022.\nThe increase in activity in 2022 resulted in an increase in demand and pricing for our sand, which continued throughout the first quarter of 2023. Demand for our natural sand\nproppant was adversely impacted in the second quarter of 2023 by the wildfires in Canada, which hindered our ability to transport sand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our sand\nbusiness remained resilient during the second quarter of 2023. As discussed above, pricing for crude oil and natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022, which slowed down\ncompletion\n57\nactivities and adversely impacted demand for our sand proppant services in the second half of 2023. We are beginning to see an uptick in orders for our sand in the first quarter of\n2024 and anticipate higher demand in 2024, partially driven by western Canada, which we expect to be accretive to current pricing.\nAs a result of adverse market conditions, production at our Muskie sand facility in Pierce County, Wisconsin has been temporarily idled since September 2018. Our contracted\ncapacity has provided a baseline of business, which has kept our Taylor and Piranha plants operating and our costs competitive.\nEnergy Infrastructure Industry\nOur infrastructure services business provides engineering, design, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. We offer a\nbroad range of services on electric transmission and distribution, or T&D, networks and substation facilities, which include engineering, design, construction, upgrade, maintenance\nand repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. Our commercial services include the installation,\nmaintenance and repair of commercial wiring. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and other disasters. We provide infrastructure services\nprimarily in the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States.\nWe currently have agreements in place with private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Since we commenced operations in this line of business, a substantial portion of our\ninfrastructure revenue has been generated from storm restoration work, primarily from PREPA, due to damage caused by Hurricane Maria. On October 19, 2017, Cobra and\nPREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945\nmillion (the “first contract”). On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second one-year master services agreement, which provided for payments of up to $900 million,\nto provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico (the “second contract”). Our work under each of the\ncontracts with PREPA ended on March 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PREPA owed us approximately $204.8 million for services we performed, excluding $197.5 million of interest charged on delinquent balances as\nof December 31, 2023. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nPREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed in July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result,\nPREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, or other\nsources. Since September 30, 2019, we have been pursuing litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and other dispute resolution efforts seeking recovery\nof the amounts owed to Cobra by PREPA for restoration services in Puerto Rico, which proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 20—“Commitments and Contingencies—\nLitigation” included elsewhere in this report. In connection with these efforts, in 2023, an aggregate of $99 million was approved by FEMA for reimbursement to Cobra for\nservices performed by Cobra, of which amount approximately $22.2 million was paid by PREPA to Cobra in 2023. On December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as\nguarantor, entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with SPCP Group, LLC (“SPCP Group”), pursuant to which Cobra transferred to SPCP Group all\nof its rights, title and interest in $54.4 million of outstanding accounts receivable with PREPA and received net proceeds of $46.1 million. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources\n—Cobra Assignment Agreement” for additional information. On December 4, 2023, following submission of a joint status report by Cobra and FEMA on December 1, 2023, in\nwhich, among other things, PREPA reported that they submitted a request for reimbursement to COR3 on November 1, 2023 for $82.4 million and is disputing approximately $1.5\nmillion of invoices from Cobra, the Court ordered PREPA to provide a detailed summary of each of their objections to the disputed amounts and directed the parties to report the\nstatus of any remaining unpaid approved invoices in connection with the status report due on January 16, 2024. On January 16, 2024, the parties filed a joint status report in which,\namong other things, PREPA reported that on December 28, 2023, it received a disbursement from COR3 for the amount requested on November 1, 2023 and was in the process of\npaying approximately $13.4 million in approved but unpaid invoices for reimbursements for services performed by Cobra to SPCP Group as Cobra’s assignee, which amount was\npaid by PREPA on January 18, 2024. PREPA, however, also informed the Court that it will withhold the release of any further funds to Cobra approved by FEMA for\nreimbursement to Cobra due to the municipal and construction excise tax claims against Cobra allegedly aggregating to $70.4 million. Cobra believes it is exempt from the\nconstruction excise taxes and strongly disagrees with PREPA’s decision to withhold funds. On January 17, 2024, Cobra filed a Writ of Certiorari requesting the Court of Appeals\nto reverse the order from the Humacao Superior Court. On February 15, 2024, Cobra’s request was granted by the Court of Appeals and the order instructing PREPA to withhold\nthe $9.0 million payment from Cobra was revoked. The case was remanded to the lower Court for continuation of the proceedings in accordance with the Court of Appeals’ order.\nThe municipality has 15 days to request reconsideration. On January 19, 2024, the Court extended the previously ordered stay in the proceedings through April 5, 2024, and\ndirected the parties to file a joint status report addressing (i) the status of any\n58\nadministrative appeals in connection with the November 2022 and December 2022 determination memoranda regarding the second contract, (ii) the status of any remaining\napproved, but unpaid invoices, and (iii) whether the parties are actively engaged in mediation to resolve their outstanding issues by March 27, 2024. Subsequent to December 31,\n2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable, of which $9.6 million was paid to Cobra and $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as\nCobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group under the Assignment Agreement, and the\nAssignment Agreement was terminated.\nWe believe all amounts charged to PREPA were in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Further, we believe these receivables are collectible. However, in the event\nPREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the\namounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the receivable may not be collected and our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including\noversight audits and compliance reviews by government agencies and representatives. In this regard, on September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\nunsealed an indictment that charged the former president of Cobra with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. Two other individuals were also charged in the\nindictment. The indictment was focused on the interactions between a former FEMA official and the former President of Cobra. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were\ncharged in the indictment. On May 18, 2022, the former FEMA official and the former president of Cobra each pled guilty to one-count information charging gratuities related to a\nproject that Cobra never bid upon and was never awarded or received any monies for. On December 13, 2022, the Court sentenced the former Cobra president to custody of the\nBureau of Prisons for six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and a fine of $25,000. The Court sentenced the FEMA official to custody of the Bureau of\nPrisons for six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and a fine of $15,000. The Court also dismissed the indictment against the two defendants. We do\nnot expect any additional activity in the criminal proceeding. Given the uncertainty inherent in the criminal litigation, however, it is not possible at this time to determine the\npotential impacts that the sentencings could have on us. PREPA has stated in Court filings that it may contend the alleged criminal activity affects Cobra’s entitlement to payment\nunder its contracts with PREPA. It is unclear what PREPA’s position will be going forward. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these investigations and proceedings. Further, as noted above, our contracts with PREPA have\nconcluded and we have not obtained, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, one or more contracts with other customers to replace the level of services that\nwe provided to PREPA.\nDuring 2022, operational improvements combined with increased crew count drove enhanced results in our infrastructure services division compared to 2021. Although\nour average crew count declined slightly from approximately 91 crews throughout 2022 to approximately 83 crews throughout 2023, operational efficiencies drove comparable\nresults. Funding for projects in the infrastructure space remains strong with added opportunities expected from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into\nlaw on November 15, 2021. We anticipate the federal spending to begin fueling additional projects in this sector and expect bidding activity to ramp up in 2024. We continue to\nfocus on operational execution and pursue opportunities within this sector as we strategically structure our service offerings for growth, intending to increase our infrastructure\nservices activity and expand both our geographic footprint and depth of projects, especially in fiber maintenance and installation projects.\nWe work for multiple utilities primarily across the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. We believe that we are well-\npositioned to compete for new projects due to the experience of our infrastructure management team, combined with our vertically integrated service offerings.

For a discussion of the results of\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023), which is\nincorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on Form 10-K.\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRevenue: (in thousands)\nWell completion services $ 131,288 $ 170,663\nInfrastructure services 110,537 111,452\nNatural sand proppant services 39,131 51,391\nDrilling services 7,126 8,380\nOther services 24,054 25,174\nEliminations (2,644) (4,974)\nTotal revenue 309,492 362,086\nCost of revenue:\nWell completion services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $16,786 and $22,080, respectively,\nfor 2023 and 2022) 108,651 128,742\nInfrastructure services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $8,382 and $16,149, respectively, for\n2023 and 2022) 90,627 91,649\nNatural sand proppant services (exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion of $7,734 and $8,725,\nrespectively, for 2023 and 2022) 26,324 36,783\nDrilling services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $4,514 and $5,810, respectively, for 2023 and\n2022) 7,121 7,599\nOther services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $7,674 and $11,506, respectively, for 2023 and\n2022) 17,761 18,788\nEliminations (2,644) (4,974)\nTotal cost of revenue 247,840 278,587\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 37,458 39,554\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 45,110 64,271\nGains on disposal of assets, net (6,041) (3,908)\nImpairment of goodwill 1,810 —\nOperating loss (16,685) (16,418)\nInterest expense and financing charges, net (16,196) (11,506)\nOther income, net 42,015 40,912\nIncome before income taxes 9,134 12,988\nProvision for income taxes 12,297 13,607\nNet loss $ (3,163) $ (619)\nRevenue. Revenue for 2023 decreased $52.6 million, or 15%, to $309.5 million from $362.1 million for 2022. The decline in total revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease\nin utilization in our well completion services division as well as a decline in tons sold in our natural sand proppant services division. Revenue derived from related parties was $1.0\nmillion for 2023 compared to $1.1 million for 2022. Revenue by division was as follows:\nWell Completion Services. Well completion services division revenue decreased $39.4 million, or 23%, to $131.3 million for 2023 from $170.7 million for 2022.\nIntersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our other services and natural sand proppant segment, totaled $0.5 million and $0.8 million, for 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n60\nThe decline in our well completion services revenue was primarily driven by decreased utilization. The number of stages completed declined 31% to 4,220 for\n2023 from 6,149 for 2022. An average of 1.8 of our six fleets were active throughout 2023 compared to 3.0 fleets for 2022.\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 1%, to $110.5 million for 2023 from $111.5 million for 2022 primarily\ndue to a decline in average crew count from 91 crews during the year ended December 31, 2022 to an average of 83 crews during the year ended December 31, 2023. This\nwas partially offset by an increase in storm restoration activity of $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $12.3 million, or 24%, to $39.1 million for 2023, from $51.4 million\nfor 2022. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our well completion segment, was a nominal amount for 2023 and $2.5 million, or 5% of total\nsand revenue, for 2022.\nThe decrease in our natural sand proppant services revenue was primarily attributable to declines in freight and shortfall revenue of $7.7 million and $1.1 million,\nrespectively, coupled with a 14% decline in tons of sand sold from approximately 1.4 million tons in 2022 to 1.2 million tons in 2023. This was partially offset by a 10%\nincrease in average price per ton of sand sold from $27.11 in 2022 to $29.86 in 2023.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services division revenue decreased $1.3 million, or 15%, to $7.1 million for 2023, from $8.4 million for 2022. Revenue derived from\nrelated parties, consisting primarily of directional drilling revenue from El Toro Resources LLC, was $0.5 million for 2023 and $0.8 million for 2022. The decrease in our\ndrilling services revenue was primarily attributable to decreased utilization for our directional drilling business from 44% for 2022 to 36% for 2023, which was partially\noffset by an increase in the average dayrate.\nOther Services. Revenue from other services, including our aviation, equipment rental, remote accommodation and equipment manufacturing businesses decreased\n$1.1 million, or 4%, to $24.1 million for 2023 from $25.2 million for 2022. Revenue derived from related parties, consisting primarily of aviation revenue from Brim\nEquipment Leasing, Inc., or Brim, was $0.4 million for 2023 and $0.3 million for 2022. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our\ninfrastructure and well completion segments, totaled $2.1 million and $1.7 million, for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe decrease in our other services revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization for our equipment rental business. We rented an average of 241 pieces of\nequipment to customers during 2023, a decrease of 3% from an average of 249 pieces of equipment rented to customers during 2022. This was offset by an increase in\nutilization for remote accommodations business. On average, 178 rooms were utilized per night during 2023, a 3% increase from an average of 172 rooms utilized per night\nin 2022.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense). Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\nexpense, decreased $30.8 million from $278.6 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2022 to $247.8 million, or 80% of total revenue, for 2023. Cost of revenue by operating division\nwas as follows:\nWell Completion Services. Well completion services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $20.0 million, or\n16%, from $128.7 million for 2022 to $108.7 million for 2023 primarily due to a decline in utilization. As a percentage of revenue, our well completion services division\ncost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $16.8 million in 2023 and $22.1 million in 2022, was 83% and 75%, for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a decrease in utilization of our pressure pumping services, resulting in a higher ratio of fixed costs to variable\ncosts.\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $1.0 million from $91.6\nmillion for 2022 to $90.6 million for 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $8.4 million in 2023 and\n$16.2 million in 2022, was 82% for each of 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, decreased\n$10.5 million, or 29%, from $36.8 million for 2022 to $26.3\n61\nmillion for 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense of $7.7 million in 2023 and $8.7 million in 2022,\nwas 67% and 72%, for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cost as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a 10% increase in average sales price.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $0.5 million, or 7%, from $7.6 million\nfor 2022 to $7.1 million for 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our drilling services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $4.5\nmillion in 2023 and $5.8 million in 2022, was 100% and 90%, for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase as a percentage of revenue in 2023 is primarily due to a\ndecrease in utilization, resulting in a higher ratio of fixed costs to variable costs.\nOther Services. Other services cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $1.0 million, or 5%, from $18.8 million for 2022 to\n$17.8 million for 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $7.7 million in 2023 and $11.5 million in 2022,\nwas 74% and 75%, for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our\noperations. SG&A expense decreased $2.1 million, or 5%, to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022\nprimarily due to a decrease in the provision for expected credit losses. The following is a breakout of SG&A expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash expenses:\nCompensation and benefits $ 15,563 $ 13,729\nProfessional services 13,448 13,501\nOther(a) 7,693 8,012\nTotal cash SG&A expense 36,704 35,242\nNon-cash expenses:\nChange in provision for expected credit losses (591) 3,389\nStock based compensation 1,345 923\nTotal non-cash SG&A expense 754 4,312\nTotal SG&A expense $ 37,458 $ 39,554\na. Includes travel-related costs, IT expenses, rent, utilities and other general and administrative-related costs.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased $19.2 million, or 30%, to $45.1 million for 2023 from\n$64.3 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in property and equipment depreciation expense as a result of lower capital expenditures and existing assets being\nfully depreciated or impaired.\nGains on Disposal of Assets, Net. Gains on the disposal of assets increased $2.1 million, or 54%, to $6.0 million for 2023 from $3.9 million in 2022. Gains on the\ndisposal of assets is primarily related to the sale of a drilling rig, trucks, and field equipment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and trucks, land and buildings for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nImpairment of Goodwill. As a result of the sale of ARS, we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill for the Aviation reporting unit. We determined that the\ncarrying value of goodwill for our Aviation reporting unit exceeded the fair value, resulting in impairment expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We did\nnot recognize any impairment of goodwill in 2022.\nOperating Loss. We reported an operating loss of $16.7 million for 2023 compared to $16.4 million for 2022. The increased operating loss in 2023 was primarily due to reduced\nutilization across our well completions and natural sand proppant divisions, partially offset by a decline in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense.\nInterest Expense and financing charges, net. Interest expense and financing charges, net increased $4.7 million to $16.2 million for 2023 from $11.5 million for 2022,\nprimarily due to a $2.8 million financing charge incurred in relation to the\n62\nAssignment Agreement with SPCP Group. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cobra Assignment Agreement” for additional information.\nOther Income, net. Other income, net increased $1.1 million during 2023 compared to 2022. We recognized interest on trade accounts receivable of $45.4 million in 2023\ncompared to $41.3 million in 2022. Additionally, on July 13, 2023, we sold all of our equity interests in ARS resulting in a $2.1 million gain on the sale.\nIncome Taxes. During 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $12.3 million on pre-tax income of $9.1 million compared to income tax expense of $13.6 million on pre-tax\nincome of $13.0 million for 2022. Our effective tax rate was 134.6% for 2023 compared to 104.8% for 2022. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign\njurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items, such as changes in the valuation allowance and interest and penalties that\nmay not be consistent from year to year. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding our change in tax expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts,\ninvestors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, gains on disposal of assets, net,\nimpairment of goodwill, impairment of other long-lived assets, public offering costs, stock based compensation, interest expense and financing charges, net, other income, net\n(which is comprised of interest on trade accounts receivable and certain legal expenses) and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further adjusted to add back interest on trade\naccounts receivable. We exclude the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to\ncompany within our industries depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted\nEBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP\nor as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a\ncompany’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of\nAdjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a\nwidely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or (loss) for each of our operating segments for the\nspecified periods (in thousands).\nConsolidated\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet loss $ (3,163) $ (619) $ (101,430)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 45,110 64,271 78,475\nGains on disposal of assets, net (6,041) (3,908) (5,147)\nImpairment of goodwill 1,810 — 891\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 1,212\nPublic offering costs — — 91\nStock based compensation 1,345 923 1,191\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 16,196 11,506 6,406\nOther income, net (42,015) (40,912) (5,154)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 12,297 13,607 (22,863)\nInterest on trade accounts receivable 45,440 41,276 34,709\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 70,979 $ 86,144 $ (11,619)\n63\nWell Completion Services\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet (loss) income $ (3,782) $ 10,194 $ (58,051)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 16,794 22,103 26,377\nGains on disposal of assets, net (2,091) (615) (770)\nPublic offering costs — — 31\nStock based compensation 508 380 333\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 4,502 1,940 1,107\nOther expense (income), net 2 (343) 1,843\nInterest on trade accounts receivable — — (1,841)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 15,933 $ 33,659 $ (30,971)\nInfrastructure Services\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ 8,237 $ 4,933 $ (36,711)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 8,390 16,171 21,880\nGains on disposal of assets, net (510) (795) (286)\nImpairment of goodwill — — 891\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 665\nPublic offering costs — — 39\nStock based compensation 538 349 500\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 9,753 7,390 3,925\nOther income, net (39,252) (40,470) (6,499)\nProvision for income taxes 11,214 13,427 712\nInterest on trade accounts receivable 45,440 41,276 36,551\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 43,810 $ 42,281 $ 21,667\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ 906 $ (1,945) $ (6,328)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 7,737 8,732 9,005\nGains on disposal of assets, net (13) (89) (30)\nPublic offering costs — — 12\nStock based compensation 187 119 202\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 540 753 474\nOther income, net (18) (14) (844)\nInterest on trade accounts receivable — — (1)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9,339 $ 7,556 $ 2,490\n64\nDrilling Services\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet loss $ (4,134) $ (6,071) $ (9,183)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 4,514 5,811 6,784\nGains on disposal of assets, net (1,577) — (205)\nPublic offering costs — — 1\nStock based compensation 23 11 66\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 489 435 237\nOther (income) expense, net (33) — 25\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (718) $ 186 $ (2,275)\nOther Services(a)\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA: 2023 2022 2021\nNet (loss) income $ (4,390) $ (7,730) $ 8,843\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 7,675 11,454 14,429\nGains on disposal of assets, net (1,850) (2,409) (3,856)\nImpairment of goodwill 1,810 — —\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 547\nPublic offering costs — — 8\nStock based compensation 89 64 90\nInterest expense and financing charges, net 912 988 663\nOther (income) expense, net (2,714) (85) 321\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 1,083 180 (23,575)\nInterest on trade accounts receivable — — —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,615 $ 2,462 $ (2,530)\na. Includes results for our aviation, equipment rentals, remote accommodations and equipment manufacturing and corporate related activities. Our corporate related activities do not generate revenue.\n65\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss per Share\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted loss per share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management to evaluate our operating and\nfinancial performance. Management believes these measures provide meaningful information about the Company’s performance by excluding certain non-cash charges, such as\nimpairment of goodwill and impairment of other long-lived assets, that may not be indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating results, from net loss. Adjusted net loss and\nadjusted loss per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss and loss per share prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to\nother similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables provide a reconciliation of adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per share to the GAAP financial measures of\nnet loss and loss per share for the periods specified.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet loss, as reported $ (3,163) $ (619) $ (101,430)\nImpairment of goodwill 1,810 — 891\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 1,212\nAdjusted net loss $ (1,353) $ (619) $ (99,327)\nBasic loss per share, as reported $ (0.07) $ (0.01) $ (2.18)\nImpairment of goodwill 0.04 — 0.02\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 0.03\nAdjusted basic loss per share $ (0.03) $ (0.01) $ (2.13)\nDiluted loss per share, as reported $ (0.07) $ (0.01) $ (2.18)\nImpairment of goodwill 0.04 — 0.02\nImpairment of other long-lived assets — — 0.03\nAdjusted diluted loss per share $ (0.03) $ (0.01) $ (2.13)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund ongoing operations including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet of equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions,\nand the litigation settlement obligations described in Note 20 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under “Capital\nRequirements and Sources of Liquidity” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility and\ncash flows from operations, as well as the net proceeds received by Cobra under the assignment agreement with SPCP Group relating to the PREPA receivable. Our primary uses\nof capital have been for investing in property and equipment used to provide our services and to acquire complementary businesses.\n66\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 16,556 $ 17,282\nRevolving credit facility borrowing base 27,016 119,756\nLess current and long-term debt — (83,520)\nLess current and long-term debt - related parties (45,000) —\nLess available borrowing capacity reserve — (10,000)\nLess letter of credit facilities (environmental remediation) (3,782) (3,694)\nLess letter of credit facilities (insurance programs) (2,500) (2,800)\nNet working capital (less cash and current portion of long-term debt)(a) 297,816 325,719\nTotal $ 290,106 $ 362,743\na. Net working capital (less cash and current portion of long-term debt) is a non-GAAP measure and, as of December 31, 2023, is calculated by subtracting total current liabilities of $182.6 million and cash and\ncash equivalents of $16.6 million from total current assets of $496.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, net working capital (less cash) is calculated by subtracting total current liabilities of $237.2 million and\ncash and cash equivalents of $17.3 million from total current assets of $496.7 million, further adjusted to add current portion of long-term debt of $83.5 million. Amounts include receivables due from PREPA\nof $402.3 million and $379.0 million and corresponding liabilities of $60.6 million and $47.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of February 28, 2024, we had cash on hand of $10.5 million, no outstanding borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and a borrowing base of $23.3 million,\nleaving an aggregate of $17.0 million of available borrowing capacity under this facility, after giving effect to $6.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of February 28, 2024,\nwe had total liquidity of $27.5 million consisting of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our new revolving credit facility. These amounts do not include $9.6\nmillion in cash received on February 29, 2024.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 31,386 $ 15,266 $ (18,865)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (8,786) (2,124) 5,507\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (15,586) (5,601) 8,428\nEffect of foreign exchange rate on cash 2 (158) 7\nNet change in cash $ 7,016 $ 7,383 $ (4,923)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $31.4 million, $15.3 million and ($18.9) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe change in operating cash flows from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increased receipts on accounts receivable, including the receipt of $22.2 million from PREPA, which\nwas partially offset by an increase in payments on accounts payable and other liabilities as well as a decline in depreciation expense. The change in operating cash flows from 2021\nto 2022 was primarily due to an increase in activity and utilization across all of our operating divisions.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($8.8) million, ($2.1) million and $5.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash\n(used in) provided by investing activities is primarily comprised of purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment and business\ndivestitures.\n67\nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures by operating division for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWell completion services(a) $ 17,931 $ 11,421 $ 4,327\nInfrastructure services(b) 716 885 627\nNatural sand proppant services(c) 223 88 484\nDrilling services(c) 110 95 23\nOther(d) 312 401 382\nEliminations 103 (153) —\nTotal capital expenditures $ 19,395 $ 12,737 $ 5,843\na. Capital expenditures primarily for upgrades to our pressure pumping fleet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintenance for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nb. Capital expenditures primarily for truck, tooling and other equipment purchases for new infrastructure crews for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nc. Capital expenditures primarily for maintenance for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nd. Capital expenditures primarily for equipment for our remote accommodations and equipment rental businesses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($15.6) million, ($5.6) million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Net\ncash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facility of $83.5 million, principal\npayments on financing leases and equipment financing notes of $12.2 million, principal payments on sale leaseback arrangements of $5.0 million, debt issuance costs of $4.0\nmillion and share repurchases used to satisfy tax withholding obligations of $0.9 million in connection with the vesting and settlement of certain executive restricted stock unit\nawards, partially offset by net proceeds from financing transactions of $46.1 million and borrowings with related parties of $43.9 million in relation to our term loan. Net cash used\nin financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facility of $1.5 million and principal payments\non financing leases and equipment notes of $4.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds received from sale-leaseback transactions of $0.2 million. Net cash provided by financing\nactivities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to net proceeds received from sale-leaseback transactions of $6.5 million and net borrowings under our\nrevolving credit facility of $4.2 million, partially offset by principal payment on financing leases and equipment notes of $2.3 million.\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rate on Cash\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate on cash was a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2023, ($0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and was a\nnominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year effect was driven primarily by a favorable (unfavorable) shift in the weakness (strength) of the\nCanadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for the cash held in Canadian accounts.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital totaled $314.4 million and $259.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our unrestricted cash balances totaled $16.6 million and $17.3\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Included in working capital are receivables due from PREPA totaling $402.3 million and $379.0 million and corresponding\nliabilities of $60.6 million and $47.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNew Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Credit Facility\nOn October 16, 2023, we entered into the new revolving credit facility and the new term credit facility (each as defined below), which refinanced in full our indebtedness\noutstanding under, and terminated, the amended and restated revolving credit facility, dated as of October 19, 2018, as amended (the “previous revolving credit facility”), with us\nand certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, as borrowers, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and as administrative\nagent for the lenders.\nOn October 16, 2023, we, as borrower, and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a revolving credit agreement with the lenders party\nthereto and Fifth Third Bank, National Association, as a lender and as\n68\nadministrative agent for the lenders (“Fifth Third”), as may be subsequently amended (the “new revolving credit facility”). The new revolving credit facility provides for revolving\ncommitments in an aggregate amount of up to $75 million. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility are secured by our assets, inclusive of the subsidiary companies, and\nare subject to a borrowing base calculation prepared monthly which includes a requirement to maintain certain reserves as specified in the new revolving credit facility. The new\nrevolving credit facility also contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants. Interest under the new revolving credit facility equals the Tranche Rate (as defined in the new\nrevolving credit facility) plus (i) 1.75%, if the Average Excess Availability Percentage (as defined in the new revolving credit facility) is greater than 66 2/3%, (ii) 2.00% if the\nAverage Excess Availability Percentage is greater than 33 1/3% and less than or equal to 66 2/3%, and (iii) 2.25% if the Average Excess Availability Percentage is less than or\nequal to 33 1/3%.\nAs of October 16, 2023, the financial covenant under the new revolving credit facility was the fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 which applies only during a\nFinancing Covenant Period (as defined in the new revolving credit facility).\nOn October 16, 2023, we, as borrower, and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors, also entered into a loan and security agreement with the lenders\nparty thereto and Wexford Capital LP, an affiliate of the Company, as administrative agent for the lenders “Wexford”), as may be subsequently amended (the “new term credit\nfacility”). The new term credit facility was approved by the audit committee of our board of directors, consisting entirely of independent directors, as a transaction with a related\nparty.\nThe new term credit facility provides for term commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $45 million. Borrowings under the new term credit facility are secured by\nour assets, inclusive of the subsidiary companies. The new term credit facility also contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants. Interest under the new term credit facility\nequals the SOFR Interest Rate (as defined in the new term credit facility) plus 7.50%, as such margin may be increased pursuant to the terms of the new term credit facility;\nprovided that we may elect to pay all or a portion of the accrued interest due with respect to any Interest Period (as defined in the new term credit facility) ending on or before April\n16, 2025, in kind by adding such accrued interest to the principal amount of the outstanding loans thereunder.\nIn particular, under the new term credit facility, we are required, among other things, to mandatorily remit to Wexford up to 50% of all amounts that constitute PREPA\nClaim Proceeds, as such term is defined in the new term credit facility, which will be used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the new term credit facility, as required under\nthe terms thereof.\nIf an event of default occurs under the new revolving credit facility or the new term credit facility, as applicable, and remains uncured, it could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The lenders, as applicable, (i) would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us under the\nnew revolving credit facility, (ii) could elect to increase the interest rate by (x) 200 basis points in connection with an event of default under the new revolving credit facility or (y)\n300 basis points with respect to an event of default under the new term credit facility, (iii) could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid\ninterest and fees, to be due and payable, (iv) may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay outstanding borrowings, and (v) may foreclose on\nsubstantially all of our assets. The exercise of remedies under the new revolving credit facility and the new term credit facility are subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement\n(the “intercreditor agreement”) between Fifth Third and Wexford and acknowledged by us and certain of our subsidiaries. The new revolving credit facility is currently scheduled\nto mature on the earliest of (x) July 17, 2028, unless the indebtedness under the new term credit facility is refinanced in accordance with terms of the intercreditor agreement, (y)\nOctober 16, 2028. The new term credit facility is currently scheduled to mature on October 16, 2028.\nWe were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants under our amended revolving credit facility in effect as of December 31, 2023. For additional information\nregarding our revolving credit facility, see Note 11. Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCobra Assignment Agreement\nOn December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with SPCP Group, LLC\n(“SPCP Group”), as purchaser. Under the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, Cobra transferred to SPCP Group, at the purchase rate of 88.0% and free and clear of\nany liens and claims, all of its rights, title and interest in the first $63.0 million (the “Transferred Amount”) of the total outstanding accounts receivable that remained unpaid by\nPREPA as of October 6, 2023 (the “PREPA Claim”), received or to be received by Cobra on or after October 6, 2023. Between October 6, 2023 and December 1, 2023, Cobra\nreceived payments from PREPA with respect to the PREPA Claim totaling $8.6 million (the “Interim Payment Amount”), resulting in the net Transferred Amount of $54.4 million.\n69\nUnder the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, any portion of the Transferred Amount that remains outstanding from PREPA from and after March 31,\n2024 will thereafter increase monthly at a rate of 1% per month, compounded. Any amount received with respect to the PREPA Claim in excess of the Transferred Amount will be\nfor the benefit of Cobra. If (i) it is determined by a final order of any court of competent jurisdiction that the PREPA Claim is subject to any defense, claim or right of setoff,\nreduction, avoidance, disallowance, subordination, disgorgement, recharacterization, adversary proceeding or other impairment, whether on contractual, legal or equitable grounds,\nresulting in the PREPA Claim being disallowed or allowed in an amount less than the Transferred Amount, or (ii) Cobra consents to, or enters into a settlement agreement with\nPREPA for, the payment that is, in an aggregate amount, less than the Transferred Amount or is otherwise adversely impacting SPCP Group’s rights transferred under the\nAssignment Agreement, Cobra has agreed to repurchase within 18 months and one day from the receipt of SPCP Group’s written demand, the unpaid portion of the Transferred\nAmount subject to such disallowance or impairment, multiplied by the purchase rate, plus interest accruing, subject to certain tolling provisions, at a rate of 6% per annum from\nDecember 1, 2023 through and including the date of such repurchase.\nIn connection with the entry into the Assignment Agreement, Mammoth and Cobra obtained the required consents from lenders under the Company’s revolving credit\nfacility with Fifth Third Bank and the Company’s term loan and security agreement with Wexford. Further, under the term loan and security agreement with Wexford, Mammoth is\nrequired, among other things, to mandatorily remit to Wexford up to 50% of all amounts that constitute PREPA Claim proceeds, to reduce outstanding borrowings under such term\nloan and security agreement. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, Wexford waived this requirement until the Assignment Agreement is terminated.\nThe net proceeds received by Cobra in connection with the Assignment Agreement were $46.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million\nwith respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable. Of the $64.0 million, $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully\nextinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated. The remaining $9.6 million was paid to Cobra.\nRepurchase Program Authorization\nOn August 10, 2023, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we would be authorized to repurchase up to the lesser of $55 million\nor 10 million shares of its common stock, subject to the factors discussed below. Following the completion of the refinancing transactions discussed in this report, any stock\nrepurchases under this program may be made opportunistically from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the\nSecurities Act of 1934, as amended, including any 10b5-1 plan, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal and contractual restrictions, liquidity requirements and\nother factors. The repurchase program has no time limit, does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time, modified or\ndiscontinued by our board of directors at any time. Any common stock repurchased as part of such stock repurchase program will be cancelled and retired. We have not\nrepurchased any shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2023 or to date. See also Item 1.A. “Risk Factors--Our ability to repurchase\nstock may be limited and no assurance can be given that we will be able to effectuate our stock repurchase program in the future at indicated levels or at all.”\nSale-Leaseback Transactions\nOn December 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement with First National Capital, LLC, or FNC, whereby we agreed to sell certain assets from our infrastructure segment\nto FNC for aggregate proceeds of $5.0 million. Concurrent with the sale of assets, we entered into a 36-month lease agreement whereby we will lease back the assets at a monthly\nrental rate of $0.1 million. On June 1, 2021, we entered into another agreement with FNC whereby we sold additional assets from our infrastructure segment to FNC for aggregate\nproceeds of $9.5 million and entered into a 42-month lease agreement whereby we lease back the assets at a monthly rental rate of $0.2 million. On June 1, 2022, we entered into\nanother agreement with FNC whereby we sold additional assets from our infrastructure segment to FNC for aggregate proceeds of $4.6 million and entered into a 42-month lease\nagreement whereby we lease back the assets at a monthly rental rate of $0.1 million. Under the agreements, we have the option to purchase the assets at the end of the lease term.\nWe recorded a liability for the proceeds received and will continue to depreciate the assets. We imputed an interest rate so that the carrying amount of the financial liabilities will\nbe the expected repurchase price at the end of the initial lease terms.\n70\nAviation Note\nOn November 6, 2020, Leopard and Cobra Aviation entered into a 39-month promissory note agreement with Bank7, or the Aviation Note, in an aggregate principal\namount of $4.6 million and received net proceeds of $4.5 million. The Aviation Note bore interest at a rate based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus a margin of 1%. The\nAviation Note was paid off on September 30, 2022.\nEquipment Financing Note\nIn December 2022, we entered into a 42-month financing arrangement with FNC for the purchase of seven new pressure pumping units for an aggregate value of $9.7\nmillion. Under this arrangement, we agreed to make monthly principal and interest payments totaling $0.3 million over the term of the agreement. This note was secured by the\nseven pressure pumping units and bore interest at an imputed rate of approximately 15.0%. This equipment note was paid off on December 22, 2023.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nAs we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources are available to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity\nrequirement. We believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our credit facility and term loan facility will be sufficient to meet our short-\nterm and long-term funding requirements, including funding our current operations, planned capital expenditures, debt service obligations and known contingencies.\nHowever, our liquidity and future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including receipt of payments from our customers, including PREPA. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, PREPA paid our subsidiary Cobra approximately $22.2 million. See also “—Cobra Assignment Agreement” regarding Cobra’s December 1, 2023\nassignment of the Transferred Amount of PREPA receivable to SPCP Group and Cobra’s receipt of $46.1 million in net proceeds in connection therewith. As of December 31,\n2023, PREPA owed Cobra approximately $402.3 million for services performed, including $197.5 million of interest charges. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid\n$64.0 million with respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable. Of the $64.0 million, $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment\nAgreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated. The remaining $9.6 million was paid to\nCobra.\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, we have released significant data that we obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests along with reviews of both our work and our\ncontracts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that, we believe, affirm the work performed by Cobra in Puerto Rico. We believe these documents in conjunction with\nthe current Administration’s focus on the recovery of Puerto Rico and our enhanced lobbying efforts will aid in collecting the outstanding amounts owed to us by PREPA.\nHowever, in the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but\nrefuses to pay the amounts owed to Cobra or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to Cobra, the receivable may not be collectible, which may adversely impact our liquidity.\nDuring 2023, our capital expenditures totaled $19.4 million, including $17.9 million in our well completion segment primarily related to upgrades to our pressure\npumping fleet, $0.7 million in our infrastructure segment primarily related to truck, tooling and equipment purchases for new crews, $0.2 million in our natural sand proppant\nservices segment for equipment maintenance and $0.6 million for our other divisions primarily related to equipment additions for our remote accommodations and equipment\nrental businesses.\nDuring 2024, we currently estimate that our aggregate capital expenditures will be approximately $15 million, depending upon industry conditions and our financial results.\nThese capital expenditures include $13 million for our well completions segment, $1 million for our infrastructure segment and $1 million for our other businesses.\nAlso, as noted above in this report, in response to market conditions we have (i) temporarily shut down certain of our oilfield service offerings, including coil tubing,\npressure control, flowback, crude oil hauling, cementing, acidizing and land drilling services, (ii) idled certain facilities, including our sand processing plant in Pierce County,\nWisconsin and (iii) reduced our workforce across all of our operations. We continue to monitor market conditions to determine if and when we will recommence these services and\noperations and increase our workforce. Any such recommencement and expansion will further increase our liquidity requirements in advance of revenue generation.\n71\nIn addition, while we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, we do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2024 since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be\naccurately forecasted. We intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, including those in the renewable energy sector as well as transactions involving entities\ncontrolled by Wexford. Our acquisitions may be undertaken with cash, our common stock or a combination of cash, common stock and/or other consideration. In the event we\nmake one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the\nexpected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital.\nIf we seek additional capital for any of the above or other reasons, we may do so through borrowings under a revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, sale-\nleaseback transactions, asset sales, including potential sales of accounts receivable, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. Although we expect that our sources of\ncapital will be adequate to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we cannot assure you that this additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain funds we need, our ability to conduct operations, make capital expenditures, satisfy debt services obligations, pay litigation settlement obligations, fund\ncontingencies and/or complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us will be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nTotal Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years\nContractual obligations:\nTerm credit facility principal(a) $ 45,000 $ — $ 6,380 $ 38,620 $ —\nCommitment fees on revolving credit facility(b) 852 188 375 289 —\nInterest on term credit facility(c) 25,411 5,899 11,441 8,071 —\nFinancing arrangement(d) 54,407 54,407 — — —\nSale-leaseback arrangements(e) 5,281 3,972 1,309 — —\nOperating lease obligations(f) 10,371 6,298 3,450 188 435\nFinancing lease obligations(g) 4,151 1,872 2,279 — —\n$ 145,473 $ 72,636 $ 25,234 $ 47,168 $ 435\na.

Our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding\nof how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. A critical accounting estimate is\none that requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. We identified our most critical accounting\nestimates to be:\n– allowance for expected credit losses;\n– valuations of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets; and\n– litigation and contingencies.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are the\ncritical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these\npolicies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nWe regularly review receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for expected credit losses. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make\njudgments regarding our customers’ ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers changes, circumstances develop,\nor additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses may be required. This process involves judgment and estimation. Accordingly,\nour results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our allowance for expected credit losses totaled $0.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively. During 2023, we wrote-off accounts\nreceivable totaling $2.8 million, substantially most of which related to an insurance receivable.\nOur accounts receivable balance included $402.3 million and $379.0 million related to PREPA as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which includes interest\ncharged on delinquent balances. During the year ended December 31, 2023, PREPA paid our subsidiary Cobra approximately $22.2 million. PREPA is currently subject to\nbankruptcy proceedings and, as a result, their ability to meet their obligations is largely dependent upon funding from the FEMA or other sources. For a description of our\ncollection efforts and related litigation against PREPA, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Accounts Receivable and Note 20. Commitments and\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve” included elsewhere in this annual\nreport.\nWe continuously review the facts and circumstances related to this receivable to determine if an allowance is needed. We believe all amounts charged to PREPA,\nincluding interest charged on delinquent accounts receivable, were in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Further, there have been multiple reviews prepared by or on behalf\nof FEMA that have concluded that the amounts Cobra charged PREPA were reasonable, that PREPA adhered to Puerto Rican legal statutes regarding emergency situations and\nthat PREPA engaged in a reasonable procurement process. We believe these receivables are collectible and for the reasons previously described as well as other factors, no\nallowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2023 or 2022. However, in the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to\nCobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the\nreceivable may not be collectible.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding our allowance for expected credit losses.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets on our balance sheet include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more\nfrequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may\n73\nexist. We conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or\ncircumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing\nthe totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform\nany further testing. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and\ncomparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on\nthat difference.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2021, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We did not recognize any\nimpairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this\nimpairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated, including significant assumptions used and other details.\nOther Long-Lived Assets. Impairment of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is evaluated by measuring the carrying\namount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flow from the\nassets is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of other long-lived assets totaling $1.2 million. We did not recognize any impairment of\nother long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nThe assumptions used in the impairment evaluation for long-lived assets are inherently uncertain and require management’s judgment. A continued period of low oil and\nnatural gas prices or continued reductions in capital expenditures by our customers would likely have an adverse impact on our utilization and the prices that we receive for our\nservices. This could result in the recognition of future material impairment charges on the same, or additional, property and equipment if future cash flow estimates, based upon\ninformation then available to management, indicate that their carrying values are not recoverable.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nAs discussed in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Accruals for\nlitigation and contingencies are based on our assessment, including advice of legal counsel, of the expected outcome of litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings and/or the\nexpected resolution of contingencies. For matters in which a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue an estimate for the resolution of the matter. For matters in\nwhich a liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we do not accrue any amounts. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of loss and the\ndetermination as to whether the amount is reasonably estimable. Accruals are based on information available at the time of the assessment due to the uncertain nature of such\nmatters. As additional information becomes available, we reassess potential liabilities related to pending claims and litigation and may revise previous estimates, which could\nmaterially affect our results of operations in a given period.\n74\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe demand, pricing and terms for our products and services are largely dependent upon the level of activity for the U.S. oil and natural gas industry, energy infrastructure\nindustry and natural sand proppant industry. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including, but not limited to: the supply of and\ndemand for oil and natural gas services, energy infrastructure services and natural sand proppant; demand for repair and construction of transmission lines, substations and\ndistribution networks in the energy infrastructure industry and the level of expenditures of utility companies; the level of prices of, and expectations about future prices for, oil and\nnatural gas and natural sand proppant, as well as energy infrastructure services; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the expected\nrates of declining current production; the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves and frac sand reserves meeting industry specifications and consisting of the mesh size\nin demand; access to pipeline, transloading and other transportation facilities and their capacity; weather conditions; domestic and worldwide economic conditions; political\ninstability in oil-producing countries; environmental regulations; technical advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the ability of oil\nand natural gas producers and other users of our services to raise equity capital and debt financing; and merger and divestiture activity in industries in which we operate.\nIn March and April 2020, concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine orders in the U.S. and worldwide, oil prices dropped sharply to below zero dollars per\nbarrel for the first time in history due to factors including significantly reduced demand and a shortage of storage facilities. In 2021, U.S. oil production stabilized as commodity\nprices increased and demand for crude oil rebounded. We saw improvements in the oilfield services industry and in both pricing and utilization of our well completion and drilling\nservices during 2022. Throughout 2023, pricing for crude oil and natural gas declined from levels seen in 2022, which slowed down completion activities for our customers, in\nparticular, in the Utica and Marcellus Shale natural gas plays, and, as a result, reduced demand for our well completion services. These factors have continued into the first quarter\nof 2024. Despite this short-term softness, however, we are seeing indications that activity levels will begin to ramp back up in mid-2024, creating the opportunity to reactivate\nadditional fleets, if appropriate. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the recent Israel-Hamas war, however, could continue to have an adverse impact on the global energy markets and\nvolatility of commodity prices, which could further adversely impact demand for our well completion services.\nAlthough the levels of activity in the U.S. oil and natural gas exploration and production, energy infrastructure and natural sand proppant industries continue to improve,\nthey have historically been and continue to be volatile. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the volatility in commodity prices, any changes in the near-term or long-term\noutlook for our industries or overall macroeconomic conditions on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $16.6 million at December 31, 2023. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest under the new revolving credit facility equals the Tranche Rate (as defined in the new revolving credit facility) plus an applicable margin, which can fluctuate based on\nmultiple facts, including rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve (which increased its benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 4.75 percentage points throughout 2022 and 2023,\nand may continue to increase interest rates), the supply and demand for credit and general economic conditions, plus an applicable margin. Interest under our new term credit\nfacility equals the SOFR Interest Rate (as defined in the new term credit facility) plus 7.50%. At December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the new credit\nfacility and $45.0 million outstanding under our term loan with an interest rate of 12.9%. Based on the outstanding borrowings under our term loan as of December 31, 2023, a 1%\nincrease or decrease in the interest rate would have increased or decreased our interest expense by approximately $0.5 million per year. We do not currently hedge our interest rate\nexposure.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur remote accommodation business, which is included in our other services division, generates revenue and incurs expenses that are denominated in the Canadian dollar. These\ntransactions could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial\nposition. We also maintain cash balances denominated in the Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2023, we had $2.4 million of cash in Canadian accounts. A 10% increase in the\nstrength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of approximately ($0.2) million as of December 31, 2023. Conversely, a\ncorresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a comparable increase in pre-tax income. We have not hedged our exposure to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates and, as a result, could incur unanticipated translation gains and losses.\n75\nCustomer Credit Risk\nWe are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our receivables from several significant customers. We generally do not require our customers to post collateral.\nThe inability, delay or failure of our customers to meet their obligations to us due to customer liquidity issues or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This risk may be further enhanced by the volatility in commodity prices, the reduction in demand for our services and\nchallenging macroeconomic conditions.\nSpecifically, we had receivables due from PREPA totaling $402.3 million as of December 31, 2023. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings pending in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the\nFEMA or other sources. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Accounts Receivable and —Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Note\n20. Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation of our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report for additional information.\nSeasonality\nWe provide infrastructure services in the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. We provide well completion and drilling services\nprimarily in the Utica, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Granite Wash, Cana Woodford and Cleveland sand resource plays located in the continental U.S. We provide remote\naccommodation services in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. We serve these markets through our facilities and service centers that are strategically located to serve our customers\nin Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Colorado, California, Indiana and Alberta, Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we generated\napproximately 48%, 45% and 48%, respectively, of our revenue from our operations in Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Canada where\nweather conditions may be severe. As a result, our operations may be limited or disrupted, particularly during winter and spring months, in these geographic regions, which would\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations in Oklahoma and Texas are generally not affected by seasonal weather\nconditions.\nInflation\nAlthough the impact of inflation has been insignificant on our operations in prior years, inflation in the U.S. has been rising at its fastest rate in over 40 years, creating\ninflationary pressure on the cost of services, equipment and other goods in our industries and other sectors and contributing to labor and materials shortages across the supply-\nchain. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rates by an aggregate of 4.75 percentage points, and may continue increasing benchmark\ninterest rates in the future. If the efforts to control inflation are not successful and inflationary pressures persist, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be\nadversely affected.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe information required by this item appears beginning on page F-1 following the signature pages of this report.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures\nUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures. In\n76\ndesigning and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2023, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management did not identify\nany material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nGrant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, has issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2023. The report, which expresses an\nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2023, is included in this Item under the heading “Report of\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.\n77\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nMammoth Energy Services, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of\nthe Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated March 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nMarch 1, 2024\n78\nItem 9B.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated\nto the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nMeasurement of receivable balances from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\nAs described further in Notes 2 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, Cobra Acquisitions LLC (“Cobra”) and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (“PREPA”)\nentered into an emergency master services agreement in October 2017 and a second master service contract in May 2018 for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid due to damage\ncaused by Hurricane Maria in 2017 (collectively, the “PREPA Contracts”). As of December 31, 2023, the consolidated financial statements include accounts receivable from\nPREPA for approximately $204.8 million for services performed as well as receivables of approximately $197.5 million of interest charges on delinquent balances in accordance\nwith the terms of the PREPA Contracts (collectively, “PREPA receivable”).\nWe identified the measurement of the receivable balances associated with the PREPA Contracts as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the measurement of the receivable balances from PREPA is a critical audit matter is the high degree of estimation uncertainty\nresulting from significant management judgment. Given that PREPA is subject to bankruptcy proceedings and as a result, its ability to meet its remaining obligations under the\nPREPA Contracts is largely dependent upon funding from FEMA or other sources, management’s qualitative evaluation of the measurement of the\nF-1\nPREPA receivable and the determination of PREPA’s ability and intent to remit payment required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to assess the\nreasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to the measurement of the receivable balances from PREPA included the following, among others.\n• We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of management’s controls over the assessment of the measurement of\nthe receivable balances from PREPA.\n• We evaluated the qualitative assessment performed by management by performing the following:\n◦ We inquired of management to gain an understanding of the relevant facts and circumstances related to the status of FEMA’s review of invoices submitted by\nPREPA for reimbursement, PREPA’s appeals with FEMA on any amounts initially determined to be ineligible for federal assistance, and the status of PREPA’s\nbankruptcy proceedings. We evaluated management’s responses and analyzed the overall impact to the measurement of the PREPA receivable.\n◦ We sent PREPA an audit confirmation to verify the receivable balance as of year-end.\n◦ We inspected publicly available information to verify PREPA’s liquidity position as of year-end, and we inspected relevant court filings to verify funds FEMA has\nobligated to PREPA.\n◦ We held direct conversations with external legal counsel handling matters pertaining to PREPA and evaluated the responses to our inquiries regarding the current\nfacts and circumstances of legal proceedings and the measurement of the accounts receivable from PREPA. Additionally, we sent inquiry letters to external legal\ncounsel and obtained written representations from management related to the measurement of the PREPA receivable and the status of legal proceedings.\n◦ We corroborated the facts and circumstances by obtaining and reviewing the relevant court filings and correspondence with officials of PREPA, FEMA, and the\nFederal Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, which is involved in the oversight of PREPA.\n◦ Through such procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s conclusions regarding the measurement of the accounts receivable from PREPA and\nassessed the weighting of evidence collected to evaluate management’s conclusion that no reserve for credit loss was necessary.\n• We assessed the sufficiency of management’s disclosures related to the PREPA receivable and related legal proceedings, including that PREPA’s ability to meet its\npayment obligations is largely dependent upon funding from FEMA or other sources and that the receivable may not be collectable if PREPA (i) does not have or does not\nobtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to the Company, or (iii)\notherwise does not pay amounts owed to the Company for services performed.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nMarch 1, 2024\nF-2\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nASSETS December 31,\n2023 2022\nCURRENT ASSETS (in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 16,556 $ 17,282\nRestricted cash 7,742 —\nAccounts receivable, net 447,155 456,465\nReceivables from related parties, net 47 223\nInventories 12,653 8,883\nPrepaid expenses 12,181 13,219\nOther current assets 591 620\nTotal current assets 496,925 496,692\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 113,905 138,066\nSand reserves 58,528 61,830\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 9,551 10,656\nIntangible assets, net 913 1,782\nGoodwill 9,214 11,717\nDeferred income tax asset 1,844 —\nOther non-current assets 7,599 3,935\nTotal assets $ 698,479 $ 724,678\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable $ 27,508 $ 47,391\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 86,713 52,297\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities -

The Company’s oil and natural gas business depends in large part on the conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and, specifically, on the\namount of capital spending by its customers. Any prolonged increase or decrease in oil and natural gas prices affects the levels of exploration, development and production\nactivity, as well as the entire health of the oil and natural gas industry. Decreases in the commodity prices for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition. During the periods presented in this report, the Company provided its infrastructure services primarily in the\nnortheastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. The Company’s infrastructure business depends on infrastructure spending on maintenance,\nupgrade, expansion and repair and restoration. Any prolonged decrease in spending by electric utility companies, delays or reductions in government appropriations or the\nfailure of customers to pay their receivables could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and the variable\ninterest entities (“VIE”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions between the entities within the Company have\nbeen eliminated.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company consolidates a VIE when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 12 for more information on the Company’s VIEs.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the Company’s sand reserves and their impact on calculating\ndepletion expense, allowance for expected credit losses, fair values used to assess recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, estimates of income\ntaxes and the estimated effects of litigation and other contingencies.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. Previously, the Company included Bison\nTrucking in its Drilling segment. The Company now presents Bison Trucking in the “All Other” reconciling column. See Note 21 for additional detail regarding our reporting\nsegments. There was no impact on previously reported total assets, total liabilities, net income (loss) or equity for the periods presented.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted cash consists of amounts held by our previous\ncreditor as collateral for letters of credit and card program. The Company maintains its cash accounts in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, with the exception of cash held by Sand Tiger in a Canadian financial institution. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.4 million, in Canadian dollars, of\ncash in Canadian accounts. Cash balances from time to time may exceed the insured amounts; however, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does\nnot believe it is exposed to any significant credit risks on such accounts.\nF-9\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the statement of financial position that sum to the total of the same\nsuch amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 16,556 $ 17,282\nRestricted cash 7,742 —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 24,298 $ 17,282\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable include amounts due from customers for services performed or goods sold. The Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and\ngenerally does not require collateral. Prior to granting credit to customers, the Company analyzes the potential customer’s risk profile by utilizing a credit report, analyzing\nmacroeconomic factors and using its knowledge of the industry, among other factors. Most areas in the continental United States in which the Company operates provide for a\nmechanic’s lien against the property on which the service is performed if the lien is filed within the statutorily specified time frame. Customer balances are generally considered\ndelinquent if unpaid by the 30th day following the invoice date and credit privileges may be revoked if balances remain unpaid. Interest on delinquent trade accounts receivable\nis recognized in “other income, net” in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss when chargeable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the period October 2017 through March 2019, the Company provided infrastructure services in Puerto Rico under master services agreements entered into by Cobra, one\nof the Company’s subsidiaries, with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (“PREPA”) to perform repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company charged interest on delinquent trade accounts receivable pursuant to the terms of its agreements with PREPA\ntotaling $45.4 million, $41.3 million and $36.6 million, respectively. These amounts are included in “other income, net” in the accompanying consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive loss. Included in “accounts receivable, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were interest charges of $197.5\nmillion and $152.0 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Current Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company regularly reviews receivables and provides for expected losses through an allowance for expected credit losses. In evaluating the level of established reserves,\nthe Company makes judgments regarding its customers’ ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers changes,\ncircumstances develop, or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses may be required. In the event the Company expects\nthat a customer may not be able to make required payments, the Company would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is\nmade. If it is determined that previously reserved amounts are collectible, the Company would decrease the allowance through a credit to income in the period in which that\ndetermination is made. Uncollectible accounts receivable are periodically charged against the allowance for expected credit losses once a final determination is made regarding\ntheir collectability.\nF-10\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFollowing is a roll forward of the allowance for expected credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nBalance, January 1, 2021 $ 30,139\nChange in provision for expected credit losses 41,873\nAdditions charged to revenue 27,071\nAdditions charged to other selling, general, and administrative expense 273\nAdditions charged to other, net - related parties 515\nAdditions charged to other income (expense), net 1,474\nRecoveries of receivables previously charged to credit loss expense (211)\nWrite-offs charged against the provision (83,049)\nBalance, December 31, 2021 18,085\nChange in provision for expected credit losses 3,550\nRecoveries of receivables previously charged to credit loss expense (161)\nWrite-offs charged against the provision (17,887)\nBalance, December 31, 2022 3,587\nChange in provision for expected credit losses 47\nRecoveries of receivables previously charged to credit loss expense (638)\nWrite-offs charged against the provision (2,831)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 165\nThe Company has made specific reserves consistent with Company policy which resulted in additions to allowance for expected credit losses totaling an ominal amount, $3.6\nmillion and $0.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. These additions were charged to credit loss expense based on the factors\ndescribed above. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded additions to allowance for expected credit losses of $0.3 million related to insurance\nclaim receivables for its directors and officers liability policy. The Company will continue to pursue collection until such time as final determination is made consistent with\nCompany policy.\nGulfport\nThe Company’s subsidiaries Stingray Pressure Pumping and Muskie were party to a pressure pumping contract and a sand supply contract, respectively, with Gulfport Energy\nCorporation (“Gulfport”). On November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed petitions for voluntary relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. See Notes 3 and 20 for additional\ninformation. Following is a roll forward of the allowance for expected credit losses specifically related to Gulfport (in thousands):\nBalance, January 1, 2022 11,714\nRecoveries of receivables previously charged to credit loss expense (147)\nWrite-offs charged against the provision (11,567)\nBalance, December 31, 2022 —\nPREPA\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, PREPA owed the Company $402.3 million and $379.0 million, respectively, which includes interest charged on delinquent balances.\nPREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed in July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a\nresult, PREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) or other sources. On\nOctober 19, 2017, one of our subsidiaries, Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid as a result of\nHurricane Maria. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million (the “first contract”). On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a\nsecond one-year, $900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in\nPuerto Rico (the “second contract”). As of December 31, 2023, PREPA owed us approximately $204.8 million for services performed excluding $197.5 million of interest\ncharged on delinquent balances. Since September 30, 2019, we have been pursuing litigation in the U.S. District\nF-11\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico and other dispute resolution efforts seeking recovery of the amounts owed to Cobra by PREPA for restoration services in Puerto Rico,\nwhich proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 20—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” included elsewhere in this report. In connection with these efforts,\nin 2023, an aggregate of $99 million was approved by FEMA for reimbursement to Cobra for services performed by Cobra, of which amount approximately $22.2 million was\npaid by PREPA to Cobra in 2023. On December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”)\nwith SPCP Group, LLC (“SPCP Group”), pursuant to which Cobra transferred to SPCP Group all of its rights, title and interest in $54.4 million of outstanding accounts\nreceivable with PREPA and received net proceeds of $46.1 million. See Note 20—“Commitments and Contingencies—Assignment Agreement” for additional information. On\nDecember 4, 2023, following submission of a joint status report by Cobra and FEMA on December 1, 2023, in which, among other things, PREPA reported that they submitted\na request for reimbursement to the Government of Puerto Rico’s Central Recovery and Reconstruction Office (“COR3”) COR3 on November 1, 2023 for $82.4 million and is\ndisputing approximately $1.5 million of invoices from Cobra, the Court ordered PREPA to provide a detailed summary of each of their objections to the disputed amounts and\ndirected the parties to report the status of any remaining unpaid approved invoices in connection with the status report due on January 16, 2024. On January 16, 2024, the\nparties filed a joint status report in which, among other things, PREPA reported that on December 28, 2023, it received a disbursement from COR3 for the amount requested on\nNovember 1, 2023 and was in the process of paying approximately $13.4 million in approved but unpaid invoices for reimbursements for services performed by Cobra to SPCP\nGroup, as Cobra’s assignee, which amount was paid by PREPA on January 18, 2024. PREPA, however, also informed the Court that it will withhold the release of any further\nfunds to Cobra approved by FEMA for reimbursement to Cobra due to municipal and construction excise tax claims against Cobra allegedly aggregating to $70.4 million.\nCobra believes it is exempt from the construction excise taxes and strongly disagrees with PREPA’s decision to withhold funds. On January 17, 2024, Cobra filed a Writ of\nCertiorari requesting the Court of Appeals to reverse the order from the Humacao Superior Court. On February 15, 2024, Cobra’s request was granted by the Court of Appeals\nand the order instructing PREPA to withhold the $9.0 million payment from Cobra was revoked. The case was remanded to the lower Court for continuation of the proceedings\nin accordance with the Court of Appeals’ order. The municipality has 15 days to request reconsideration. On January 19, 2024, the Court extended the previously ordered stay\nin the proceedings through April 5, 2024, and directed the parties to file a joint status report addressing (i) the status of any administrative appeals in connection with the\nNovember 2022 and December 2022 determination memoranda regarding the second contract, (ii) the status of any remaining approved, but unpaid invoices, and (iii) whether\nthe parties are actively engaged in mediation to resolve their outstanding issues by March 27, 2024. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect\nto the outstanding PREPA receivable, of which $9.6 million was paid to Cobra and $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment\nAgreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group under the Assignment Agreement, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated.\nThe Company believes all amounts charged to PREPA, including interest charged on delinquent accounts receivable, were in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\nFurther, there have been multiple reviews prepared by or on behalf of FEMA that have concluded that the amounts Cobra charged PREPA were reasonable, that PREPA\nadhered to Puerto Rican legal statutes regarding emergency situations, and that PREPA engaged in a reasonable procurement process. The Company believes these receivables\nare collectible and no allowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2023 or 2022. However, in the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary\nto satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the remaining amounts owed to the Company or (iii) otherwise does not\npay amounts owed to the Company, the receivable may not be collectible.\nInventory\nInventory consists of raw sand and processed sand available for sale, raw materials, chemicals and other products sold as a bi-product of completion and production operations\nand supplies used in performing services. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value) on an average cost basis. The Company assesses the valuation\nof its inventories based upon specific usage, future utility, obsolescence and other factors.\nInventory manufactured at the Company’s sand production facilities includes direct excavation costs, processing costs and overhead allocation. Stockpile tonnages are\ncalculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number\nof tons in the stockpile. Inventory transported for sale at the Company’s terminal facility includes the cost of purchased or manufactured sand, plus transportation related\ncharges.\nSee Note 5 for additional disclosure related to inventory.\nF-12\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPrepaid Expenses\nPrepaid expenses primarily consist of insurance costs and rail car freight and lease expense. These costs are expensed over the periods that they benefit.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including renewals and betterments, are capitalized and stated at cost, while maintenance and repairs that do not increase the capacity, improve the\nefficiency or safety, or improve or extend the useful life are charged to operations as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and any resulting\ngain or loss is recorded in operations. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life, or the remaining lease term, as\napplicable. Depreciation does not begin until property and equipment is placed in service. Once placed in service, depreciation on property and equipment continues while being\nrepaired, refurbished, or between periods of deployment.\nSand Reserves\nSand reserve costs include engineering, mineralogical studies and other related costs to develop the mine, the removal of overburden to initially expose the mineral and building\naccess ways. Exploration costs are expensed as incurred and classified as product cost of revenue. Capitalization of mine development project costs begins once the deposit is\nclassified as proven and probable reserves. Drilling and related costs are capitalized for deposits where proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are directed at\nobtaining additional information on the deposit or converting non-reserve minerals to proven and probable reserves and the benefit is to be realized over a period greater than\none year. Mining property and development costs are amortized using the units-of-production method on estimated measured tons in in-place reserves. The impact of revisions\nto reserve estimates is recognized on a prospective basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard\nCodification (“ASC”) 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to\nfuture undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs and\nexpenses and other factors. If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount in which the carrying amount of the\nassets exceeds the fair value of the assets. See Note 7 for additional disclosure related to impairment of long-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. If it is determined that an\nimpairment exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of carrying value over implied fair value. The fair value is determined using a combination of the income\nand market approaches. See Note 7 and Note 8 for additional disclosures related to goodwill.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nOther non-current assets primarily consist of deferred financing costs on our revolving credit facility (see Note 11) and our equity method investment (see Note 9). Investments\nare accounted for under the equity method in circumstances where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of the\ninvestee, but does not have control. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings in its consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nInvestments are evaluated for impairment and a charge to earnings is recognized when any identified impairment is determined to be other than temporary.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nMine reclamation costs, future remediation costs for inactive mines and other contractual site remediation costs are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of\neach period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates\nare reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.\nF-13\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFollowing is a roll forward of the Company’s asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance as of beginning of period $ 3,981 $ 3,720\nAdditions and revisions of prior estimates — 176\nAccretion expense 141 136\nForeign currency translation adjustment 18 (51)\nAsset retirement obligation as of end of period $ 4,140 $ 3,981\nAmortizable Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets subject to amortization include trade names, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Notes 7 and 8 for additional disclosures related to\nintangible assets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.\nThe Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities\nbeing measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses appropriate valuation techniques based on available inputs to measure the fair values of\nits assets and liabilities.\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2 - Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets\nincluded in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best\nestimate of fair value.\nThe Company elected the fair value option for measuring the liability of the Assignment Agreement. To estimate the fair value of the liability, the Company used inputs that are\nnot observable in the market (Level 3) based on an income approach. The Company used the contractual settlement amount, imputed interest rate and expected timing of cash\nflows to estimate the liability as of December 31, 2023 using the discounted cash flow model. See Notes 10 and 20.\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, trade payables and receivables and payables from related parties approximates fair value\nbecause of the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of debt approximates its carrying value because the cost of borrowing fluctuates based upon market\nconditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from contract billing or payment schedules, resulting in revenues that have been earned but not billed (“unbilled revenue”) or\namounts that have been billed, but not earned (“deferred revenue”). The Company had $12.7 million and $21.1 million, respectively, of unbilled revenue included in “accounts\nreceivable, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company had $0.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively, of deferred\nrevenue included in “accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLoss per Share\nLoss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of outstanding shares. See Note 16.\nF-14\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEquity-based Compensation\nThe Company measures equity-based payments at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the value of these equity-based payments in compensation expense over the\napplicable vesting periods. See Note 17.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company’s stock-based compensation program consists of restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under\nthe Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2016 Plan”). The Company recognizes in its financial statements the cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for restricted stock based on the fair value of the equity instruments as of the grant date. In general, this value is amortized over the vesting period; for\ngrants with a non-substantive service condition, this value is recognized immediately. Amounts are recognized in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative\nexpenses. See Note 18.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s operations are included in a consolidated federal income tax return and other state returns. Accordingly, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax\nbases for all our subsidiaries as if each entity were a corporation, regardless of its actual characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nUnder FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to\napply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a\nchange in tax rate are recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than\nnot that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, the Company uses estimates and judgments regarding future taxable income, as well as\nthe jurisdiction in which such taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Certain income from our infrastructure services segment\nand income from our remote accommodations business is subject to foreign income taxes, and such taxes are provided in the financial statements pursuant to FASB ASC 740.\nThe Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in preparation of its tax returns and disallows the recognition of tax positions that do not meet a “more likely\nthan not” threshold of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The Company has recorded interest and penalty payable of $5.0 million and $2.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the 2021 and 2022 tax year returns in Puerto Rico. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and applicable\npenalties in income tax expense.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nAccruals for litigation and contingencies are reflected in the consolidated financial statements based on management’s assessment, including advice of legal counsel, of the\nexpected outcome of litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings and/or the expected resolution of contingencies. Liabilities for estimated losses are accrued if the\npotential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination\nof probability of loss and the determination as to whether the amount is reasonably estimable. Accruals are based only on information available at the time of the assessment\ndue to the uncertain nature of such matters. As additional information becomes available, management reassesses potential liabilities related to pending claims and litigation\nand may revise its previous estimates. See Note 20.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated at the period-end exchange rate and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the\nperiod. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, if any, are re-\nmeasured at the balance sheet date. Transaction gains or losses are included as a component of current period earnings.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Management has established procedures for the\nongoing evaluation of the Company’s operations, to identify potential environmental exposures and to comply with regulatory policies and procedures. Environmental\nexpenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing\nF-15\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncondition caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental costs\nare probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company maintains insurance which may cover in whole or in part certain environmental expenditures. The\nCompany had $0.6 million of probable environmental liabilities included in “accounts payable” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, there were no probable environmental matters.\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss included certain changes in equity that are excluded from net loss.\nSpecifically, cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents in excess of federally insured limits and trade\nreceivables. Following is a summary of our significant customers based on accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and revenues derived for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nREVENUES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nYears Ended December 31, At December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\nCustomer A(a) 9 % 10 % 6 % — % — %\nCustomer B(b) — % — % — % 90 % 83 %\na. Customer A is a third-party customer. Revenues and the related accounts receivable balances earned from Customer A were derived from the Company’s well completion services segment.\nb. Customer B is a third-party customer. Revenues and the related accounts receivable balances earned from Customer B were derived from the Company’s infrastructure services segment. Accounts\nreceivable for Customer B also includes receivables due for interest charged on delinquent accounts receivable.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment reporting (Topic 280)”, which is intended to improve reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendment requires disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) as well as other segment items, extends certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarifies the applicability to\nsingle reportable segment entities, permits more than one measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions and requires disclosure of the title and position of the\nCODM. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024. We expect\nto adopt the new disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on its\ndisclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires the annual financial statements to\ninclude consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on its disclosures.\n3. Revenues\nThe Company’s primary revenue streams include well completion services, infrastructure services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other services, which\nincludes aviation, equipment rentals, remote accommodations and equipment manufacturing. See Note 21 for the Company’s revenue disaggregated by type.\nCertain of the Company’s customer contracts include provisions entitling the Company to a termination penalty when the customer invokes its contractual right to terminate\nprior to the contract’s nominal end date. The termination penalties in the customer contracts vary, but are generally considered substantive for accounting purposes and create\nenforceable rights and obligations throughout the stated duration of the contract. The Company accounts for a contract cancellation as a contract modification in the period in\nwhich the customer invokes the termination provision. The determination of the contract termination penalty is based on the terms stated in the related customer agreement. As\nof the modification date, the Company updates its estimate of the transaction price using the expected value method, subject to constraints, and recognizes the amount over the\nremaining performance period.\nF-16\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWell Completion Services\nWell completion services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis.\nGenerally, the Company accounts for well completion services as a single performance obligation satisfied over time. In certain circumstances, the Company supplies proppant\nthat is utilized for pressure pumping as part of the agreement with the customer. The Company accounts for these pressure pumping agreements as multiple performance\nobligations satisfied over time. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Generally, revenue is recognized over\ntime upon the completion of each segment of work based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to\nthe location and personnel.\nPursuant to a contract with Gulfport, Stingray Pressure Pumping agreed to provide Gulfport with use of up tot wo pressure pumping fleets for the period covered by the contract.\nUnder this agreement, performance obligations were satisfied as services were rendered based on the passage of time rather than the completion of each segment of work.\nStingray Pressure Pumping had the right to receive consideration from this customer even if circumstances prevent them from performing work. All consideration owed to\nStingray Pressure Pumping for services performed during the contractual period was fixed and the right to receive it was unconditional. On December 28, 2019, Gulfport filed a\nlegal action in Delaware state court seeking the termination of this contract and monetary damages. Further, on November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed petitions for voluntary relief\nunder chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On March 22, 2021, Gulfport listed the Stingray Pressure Pumping contract on its master rejection schedule filed with the bankruptcy\ncourt. The Company determined that these factors changed the scope of the contract, accelerated the duration of, and otherwise changed the rights and obligations of each party\nto the contract. As a result, the Company accounted for this as a contract modification during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Stingray Pressure Pumping used the\nexpected value method to estimate unliquidated damages totaling $37.9 million, which resulted in the recognition of net revenue totaling $14.8 million and bad debt expense of\n$2.9 million on previously recognized revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2021. On September 21, 2021, the Company and Gulfport reached a settlement under\nwhich all litigation relating to the Stingray Pressure Pumping contract will be terminated. Stingray Pressure Pumping released all claims against Gulfport and its subsidiaries\nwith respect to Gulfport’s bankruptcy proceedings and each of the parties released all claims they had against the others with respect to the litigation matters discussed in Note\n20. As a result of this settlement agreement, during the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company wrote off its remaining receivable related to the Stingray\nPressure Pumping claim resulting in bad debt expense and other expense of $31.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Gulfport was a related party until June 29, 2021. On\nJune 29, 2021, pursuant to the terms of its plan of reorganization, all of the Company’s shares that Gulfport owned were transferred to a trust for the benefit of certain of\nGulfport’s creditors. The revenue recognized related to this agreement is included in “services revenue - related parties” in the accompanying consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive loss. See Notes 13 and 20 below.\nAdditional revenue is generated through labor charges and the sale of consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. Such amounts are recognized\nratably over the period during which the corresponding goods and services are consumed.\nInfrastructure Services\nInfrastructure services are typically provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts or fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts.\nPricing under these contracts may be unit priced, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis). Generally, the Company accounts for\ninfrastructure services as a single performance obligation satisfied over time. In certain circumstances, the Company supplies materials that are utilized during the jobs as part\nof the agreement with the customer. The Company accounts for these infrastructure agreements as multiple performance obligations satisfied over time. Revenue is recognized\nover time as work progresses based on the days completed or as the contract is completed. Under certain customer contracts in our infrastructure services segment, the\nCompany warranties equipment and labor performed for a specified period following substantial completion of the work.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\nThe Company sells natural sand proppant through sand supply agreements with its customers. Under these agreements, sand is typically sold at a flat rate per ton or a flat rate\nper ton with an index-based adjustment. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when the customer obtains legal title to the product, which may occur at the\nproduction facility, rail origin or at the destination terminal.\nF-17\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCertain of the Company’s sand supply agreements contain a minimum volume commitment related to sand purchases whereby the Company charges a shortfall payment if the\ncustomer fails to meet the required minimum volume commitment. These agreements may also contain make-up provisions whereby shortfall payments can be applied in\nfuture periods against purchased volumes exceeding the minimum volume commitment. If a make-up right exists, the Company has future performance obligations to deliver\nexcess volumes of product in subsequent periods. In accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, if the customer fails to meet the minimum\nvolume commitment, the Company will assess whether it expects the customer to fulfill its unmet commitment during the contractually specified make-up period based on\ndiscussions with the customer and management’s knowledge of the business. If the Company expects the customer will make-up deficient volumes in future periods, revenue\nrelated to shortfall payments will be deferred and recognized on the earlier of the date on which the customer utilizes make-up volumes or the likelihood that the customer will\nexercise its right to make-up deficient volumes becomes remote. The Company did not have any deferred revenue related to shortfall payments at December 31, 2023 or 2022,\nrespectively. If the Company does not expect the customer will make-up deficient volumes in future periods, the breakage model will be applied and revenue related to shortfall\npayments will be recognized when the model indicates the customer’s inability to take delivery of excess volumes. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nthe Company recognized revenue totaling $2.0 million, $3.1 million and $12.0 million, respectively, related to shortfall payments.\nIn certain of the Company’s sand supply agreements, the customer obtains control of the product when it is loaded into rail cars and the customer reimburses the Company for\nall freight charges incurred. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the sand. If revenue is recognized for\nthe related product before the shipping and handling activities occur, the Company accrues the related costs of those shipping and handling activities.\nPursuant to its contract with Gulfport, Muskie agreed to sell and deliver specified amounts of sand to Gulfport. In September 2020, Muskie filed a lawsuit against Gulfport to\nrecover delinquent payments due under this agreement. On November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed petitions for voluntary relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On\nMarch 22, 2021, Gulfport listed the Muskie contract on its master rejection schedule filed with the bankruptcy court. The Company determined that these factors changed the\nscope of the contract, accelerated the duration of, and otherwise changed the rights and obligations of each party to the contract. As a result, the Company accounted for this as\na contract modification during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Muskie used the expected value method to estimate unliquidated damages totaling $8.5 million, which\nresulted in the recognition of net revenue totaling $2.1 million and bad debt expense of $1.0 million on previously recognized revenue during the three months ended March 31,\n2021. On September 21, 2021, the Company and Gulfport reached a settlement under which all litigation relating to the Muskie contract was terminated, each of the parties\nreleased all claims they had against the others with respect to the litigation matters discussed in Note 20 and Muskie’s contract claim against Gulfport was allowed under\nGulfport’s plan of reorganization in the amount of $3.1 million. As a result of this settlement agreement, Muskie recognized bad debt expense of $0.2 million during the third\nquarter of 2021. Gulfport was a related party until June 29, 2021. The revenue recognized related to this agreement is included in “product revenue - related parties” in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. See Notes 13 and 20 below.\nDrilling Services\nContract drilling services were provided under daywork contracts. Directional drilling services, including motor rentals, are provided on a day rate or hourly basis, and revenue\nis recognized as work progresses. Performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses based on the measure of output. Mobilization revenue and costs were\nrecognized over the days of actual drilling. As a result of market conditions, the Company temporarily shut down its contract land drilling operations beginning in December\n2019 and its rig moving operations beginning in April 2020.\nOther Services\nDuring the periods presented, the Company also provided aviation, equipment rentals, crude oil hauling, remote accommodations and equipment manufacturing, which are\nreported under other services. As a result of market conditions, the Company temporarily shut down its coil tubing, pressure control and full service transportation operations\nbeginning in July 2020 and its crude oil hauling operations beginning in July 2021. The Company’s other services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract\nor on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis. Performance obligations for these services are satisfied over time and revenue is\nrecognized as the work progresses based on the measure of output.

Impairments\nImpairment of Goodwill\nUnder GAAP, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company\ndetermines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if the\nCompany concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with\nthe carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.\nAs a result of the ARS sale, we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2023. Based on the qualitative assessment described above, the\nCompany concluded that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the Aviation reporting unit was greater than its fair value. To determine fair value of the Aviation\nreporting unit at September 30, 2023, the Company used the income approach. The income approach estimates the fair value based on anticipated cash flows that are discounted\nusing a weighted average cost of capital. As a result, the Company impaired goodwill associated with Cobra Aviation, resulting in a $1.8 million impairment charge during the\nthird quarter of 2023. The Company performed an assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that the fair value of its goodwill was greater than its\ncarrying value. Therefore, no additional impairment was deemed necessary at December 31, 2023.\nThe Company performed the qualitative assessment described above during the fourth quarter of 2022. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely\nthan not that the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units was greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required and no impairment was\nrecognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company performed the qualitative assessment described above during the fourth quarter of 2021. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely\nthan not that the fair value of the Stingray Pressure Pumping, Silverback and Aviation reporting units was greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was\nrequired on these units. Additionally, the Company concluded that the carrying value for its infrastructure reporting unit was greater than its fair value. To determine fair value\nof the infrastructure reporting unit at December 31, 2021, the Company used the income approach. As a result, the Company impaired goodwill associated with 5 Star and\nHigher Power, resulting in a $0.9 million impairment charge for 2021.\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nDue to market conditions, the Company temporarily shut down its crude oil hauling operations beginning in July 2021. As a result, the Company recognized impairment of trade\nnames totaling $0.5 million, which is included in “impairment of other long-lived assets” in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The Company\nperformed a review of its intangible asset balances as of December 31, 2021 and determined the fair value of Higher Power’s trade names and customer relationships was less\nthan their carrying value, resulting in an additional impairment expense of $0.7 million at year-end.\nThe assumptions used in the impairment evaluation for long-lived assets are inherently uncertain and require management’s judgment. A continued period of low oil and natural\ngas prices or continued reductions in capital expenditures by our customers would likely have an adverse impact on our utilization and the prices that we receive for our\nservices. This could result in the recognition of future material impairment charges on the same, or additional, property and equipment if future cash flow estimates, based upon\ninformation then available to management, indicate that their carrying values are not recoverable.\nF-21\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n8.

Dire Wolf and Predator Aviation entered into the Voting Trust Agreements in order to meet certain registration requirements.\nDire Wolf’s and Predator Aviation’s voting rights are not proportional to their respective obligations to absorb expected returns or losses of Cobra Aviation and Leopard,\nrespectively, and all of Cobra Aviation’s and Leopard’s activities are conducted on behalf of Dire Wolf and Predator Aviation, which have disproportionately fewer voting\nrights; therefore, Cobra Aviation and Leopard meet the criteria of a VIE. Cobra Aviation and Leopard’s operational activities are directed by Dire Wolf’s and Predator\nAviation’s officers and Dire Wolf and Predator Aviation have the option to terminate the Voting Trust Agreements at any time. Therefore, the Company, through Dire Wolf\nand Predator Aviation, is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and consolidates Cobra Aviation and Leopard at December 31, 2023.\n13.

The Company has foreign tax credits carryforwards of $96.3 million as of December 31, 2023. These credits have a 10-\nyear carryforward period and begin to expire in 2028.\nThe Company maintains a partial valuation allowance related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, as it cannot objectively assert that these deferred tax assets are more\nlikely than not to be realized. All available positive and negative evidence was weighed to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary. The more significant\nevidential matter is the higher foreign tax rate applied to foreign source income in comparison to the U.S. Federal tax rate of 21%. As a result, the Company has foreign tax\ncredits in excess of the corresponding U.S. income tax liability for which the foreign tax credits are allowed as an offset and, therefore, are not likely to be realized.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had undistributed earnings in its Puerto Rico foreign branch. The distribution of these undistributed earnings is subject to a withholding\ntax in Puerto Rico and since the Company intends to make these distributions in the future, the withholding tax has been accrued.\nThe Company has recorded interest and penalties payable of $5.0 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the 2020, 2021 and 2022 tax\nyear returns in Puerto Rico and the 2019 tax year return in the United States. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and applicable penalties in income tax expense.\nThe Company did not have any uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the tax authorities.

Leases\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company recognizes a lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease\nterm for all leases with a term in excess of 12 months. For operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while\nfinance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. For all leases with a term of 12 months or less, the Company has elected the practical\nexpedient to not recognize lease assets and liabilities and recognizes lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s operating leases are primarily for rail cars, real estate, and equipment and its finance leases are primarily for machinery and equipment. Generally, the\nCompany does not include renewal or termination options in its assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain.\nThe accounting for some of the Company’s leases may require significant judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the\nincremental borrowing rates to utilize in the net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate and assessing the\nlikelihood of renewal or termination options. Lease agreements that contain a lease and non-lease component are generally accounted for as a single lease component.\nThe rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable. Therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the\ncommencement date of its leases in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that it\nwould pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nLease expense consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease expense $ 7,510 $ 6,804\nShort-term lease expense 515 75\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets 2,059 1,820\nInterest on lease liabilities 191 215\nTotal lease expense $ 10,275 $ 8,914\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 9,551 $ 10,656\nCurrent operating lease liability 5,771 5,447\nLong-term operating lease liability 3,534 4,913\nFinance leases:\nProperty and equipment, net $ 3,966 $ 7,267\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,702 4,003\nOther liabilities 2,138 2,602\nF-29\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther supplemental information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 7,438 $ 6,790\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 191 215\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 3,716 2,655\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases $ 5,681 $ 5,190\nFinance leases 1,417 3,058\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases 2.5 years 2.9 years\nFinance leases 2.2 years 2.0 years\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases 8.7 % 4.1 %\nFinance leases 6.3 % 4.3 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2024 $ 6,298 $ 1,872\n2025 2,725 918\n2026 725 1,361\n2027 174 —\n2028 14 —\nThereafter 435 —\nTotal lease payments 10,371 4,151\nLess: Present value discount 1,066 311\nPresent value of lease payments $ 9,305 $ 3,840\nLessor Accounting\nCertain of the Company’s agreements with its customers for other services, aviation services and remote accommodation services contain an operating lease component under\nFASB ASC 842, Leases, because (i) there are identified assets, (ii) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified assets throughout the period\nof use and (iii) the customer directs the use of the identified assets throughout the period of use. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient provided to lessors\nto combine the lease and non-lease components of a contract where the revenue recognition pattern is the same and where the lease component, when accounted for separately,\nwould be considered an operating lease. The practical expedient also allows a lessor to account for the combined lease and non-lease components under FASB ASC 606,\nwhen the non-lease component is the predominant element of the combined component.\nThe Company’s lease agreements are generally short-term in nature and lease revenue is recognized over time based on a monthly, daily or hourly rate basis. The Company\ndoes not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented assets at the end of the lease and the lessees do not provide residual value guarantees on the rented assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized lease revenue, which is included in “services\nF-30\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrevenue” and “services revenue - related parties” in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss of $3.2 million, $3.3 million, and $2.4 million,\nrespectively.\n16.

No incremental shares of potentially dilutive restricted stock awards were included for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021 as their effect was antidilutive under the treasury stock method.\n17. Equity Based Compensation\nUpon formation of certain operating entities by Wexford and Gulfport, specified members of management (the “Specified Members”) and certain non-employee members (the\n“Non-Employee Members”) were granted the right to receive distributions from the operating entities after the contribution member’s unreturned capital balance was recovered\n(referred to as “Payout” provision).\nOn November 24, 2014, the awards were modified in conjunction with the contribution of the operating entities to Mammoth. These awards were not granted in limited or general\npartner units. The awards are for interests in the distributable earnings of the members of MEH Sub, Mammoth’s majority equity holder.\nOn the closing date of Mammoth Inc.’s initial public offering (“IPO”), the unreturned capital balance of Mammoth’s majority equity holder was not fully recovered from its sale\nof common stock in the IPO. As a result, Payout did not occur and no compensation cost was recorded.\nPayout for the remaining awards is expected to occur as the contribution member’s unreturned capital balance is recovered from additional sales by MEH Sub of its shares of the\nCompany’s common stock or from dividend distributions, which is not considered probable until the event occurs. For the Specified Member awards, the unrecognized amount,\nwhich represents the fair value of the award as of the modification dates or grant date, was $5.6 million.\nFor the Company’s Non-Employee Member awards, the unrecognized amount, which represents the fair value of the awards as of the date of adoption of ASU 2018-07 was $18.9\nmillion.\n18. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe 2016 Plan authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors to grant restricted stock, restricted stock\nunits, stock appreciation rights, stock options and performance awards. There was a maximum of 4.5 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016\nPlan, of which 0.6 million shares of common stock remain available for future grants under the 2016 Plan as of December 31, 2023.\nF-31\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe fair value of restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.

The Company believes these receivables are collectible. PREPA, however, is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed\nin July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA’s ability to meet its payment obligations is largely\ndependent upon funding from FEMA or other sources. On September 30, 2019, Cobra filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking\nrecovery of the amounts owed to Cobra by PREPA, which motion was stayed by the Court. On March 25, 2020, Cobra filed an urgent motion to modify the stay order and\nallow the recovery of approximately $61.7 million in claims related to a tax gross-up provision contained in the emergency master service agreement, as amended, that was\nentered into with PREPA on October 19, 2017. This emergency motion was denied on June 3, 2020 and the Court extended the stay of our motion. On December 9, 2020, the\nCourt again extended the stay of our motion and directed PREPA to file a status motion by June 7, 2021. On April 6, 2021, Cobra filed a motion to lift the stay order.\nFollowing this filing, PREPA initiated discussion, which resulted in PREPA and Cobra filing a joint motion to adjourn all deadlines relative to the April 6, 2021 motion until\nthe June 16, 2021 omnibus hearing as a result of PREPA’s understanding that FEMA would release a report in the near future relating to the emergency master service\nagreement between PREPA and Cobra that was executed on October 19, 2017. The joint motion was granted by the Court on April 14, 2021. On May 26, 2021, FEMA issued\na Determination Memorandum related to the first contract between Cobra and PREPA in which, among other things, FEMA raised two contract compliance issues and, as a\nresult, concluded that approximately $47 million in costs were not authorized costs under the contract. On June 14, 2021, the Court issued an order adjourning Cobra’s motion\nto lift the stay order to a hearing on August 4, 2021 and directing Cobra and PREPA to meet and confer in good faith concerning, among other things, (i) the May 26, 2021\nDetermination Memorandum issued by FEMA and (ii) whether and when a second determination memorandum is expected. The parties were further directed to file an\nadditional status report, which was filed on July 20, 2021. On July 23, 2021, with the aid of Mammoth, PREPA filed an appeal of the entire $47 million that FEMA de-\nobligated in the May 26, 2021 Determination Memorandum. FEMA approved the appeal in part and denied the appeal in part. FEMA found that staffing costs of $24.4 million\nare eligible for funding. On August 4, 2021, the Court extended the stay and directed that an additional status report be filed, which was done on January 22, 2022. On January\n26, 2022, the Court extended the stay and directed the parties to file a further status report by July 25, 2022. On June 7, 2022, Cobra filed a motion to lift the stay order. On\nJune 29, 2022 the Court denied Cobra’s motion and extended the stay to January 2023. On November 21, 2022, FEMA issued a Determination Memorandum related to the\n100% federal funded portion of the second contract between Cobra and PREPA in which FEMA concluded that approximately $5.6 million in costs were not authorized costs\nunder the contract. On December 21, 2022, FEMA issued a Determination Memorandum related to the 90% federal cost share portion of the second contract between Cobra\nand PREPA in which FEMA concluded that approximately $68.1 million in costs were not authorized costs under the contract. PREPA filed first-level administrative appeals\nof the November 21, 2022 and December 21, 2022. On January 7, 2023, Cobra and PREPA filed a joint status report with the Court, in which PREPA requested that the Court\ncontinue the stay through July 31, 2023 and Cobra requested that the stay be lifted. On January 18, 2023, the Court entered an order extending the stay and directing the parties\nto file a further status report addressing (i) the status of any administrative appeals in connection with the November and December determination memoranda regarding the\nsecond contract, (ii) the status of the criminal case against the former Cobra president and the FEMA official that concluded in December 2022, and (iii) a summary of the\noutstanding and unpaid amounts arising from the first and second contracts and whether PREPA disputes Cobra’s entitlement to these amounts with the Court by July 31, 2023.\nOn January 20, 2023, Cobra submitted a certified claim for approximately $379 million to FEMA pursuant to the federal Contract Disputes Act. On February 1, 2023, FEMA\nnotified Cobra that it had reviewed the claim and determined that no contract, expressed or implied, exists between FEMA and Cobra. On March 29, 2023, Cobra filed a notice\nof appeal with the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals related to the certified claim submitted in January 2023. On April 25, 2023, FEMA filed a motion to dismiss Cobra’s\nappeal alleging lack of jurisdiction. On March 27, 2023, Cobra was notified that FEMA had approved $233 million in Cobra invoices related to the December 21, 2022\nDetermination Memorandum. The 90% federal cost share of this approved amount was $210 million, which was obligated and made available for draw down on March 27,\n2023. Of this $210 million, approximately $99 million has been represented by both PREPA and FEMA as intended to pay Cobra for outstanding invoices and the remaining\n$111 million is a reimbursement to PREPA for payments already made on Cobra invoices. On May 16, 2023, Cobra filed a motion to lift the stay order. In a June 8, 2023\nhearing, the Court ordered PREPA to provide Cobra a detailed report on the status of their review of the invoices that make up the aforementioned $99 million. On June 14,\n2023, PREPA paid Cobra approximately $10.8 million, all of which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company’s previous revolving credit facility, as\nrequired under the terms thereof. Additionally, on June 14, 2023, PREPA filed a report noting a portion of the approved, but unpaid invoices would be submitted to COR3\nwithin two weeks of the filing and the remainder of the invoices would be submitted to COR3 within four weeks of the filing. Following the passage of the two-week and four-\nweek periods contained in the June 14, 2023 report, Cobra filed an\nF-35\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninformative motion with the Court regarding the passage of the respective periods and PREPA’s failure to meet the deadlines. The Court ordered PREPA to respond to Cobra’s\ninformative motion, which PREPA did on July 21, 2023. In this Court ordered response, PREPA informed the Court that an additional $8.4 million of invoices had been\nsubmitted for payment and that $72 million in FEMA approved costs were awaiting engineer certification. On August 2, 2023, following submission of a joint status report by\nCobra and FEMA on July 31, 2023, in which, among other things, PREPA requested the stay be continued and Cobra requested the stay be lifted, the Court entered an order\ncontinuing the stay until October 31, 2023 and requiring another joint status report be filed on October 16, 2023. On August 22, 2023, PREPA paid Cobra approximately\n$2.0 million, all of which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company’s previous revolving credit facility. On August 30, 2023, Cobra filed an informative\nmotion with the Court regarding the status of the approved, but unpaid invoices. The Court ordered PREPA to respond to Cobra’s informative motion, which PREPA did on\nSeptember 18, 2023. In this Court ordered response, PREPA informed the Court that the approved, but unpaid invoices were in the process of being entered into PREPA’s\nsystem for payment. On September 22, 2023 and October 10, 2023, PREPA made payments to Cobra of approximately $0.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively, all of which\nwas used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company’s previous revolving credit facility. On October 16, 2023 and October 25, 2023, PREPA made additional\npayments to Cobra of approximately $1.7 million and $1.2 million. Also on October 16, 2023, pursuant to Court’s prior order, the parties submitted a further joint status report.\nIn the joint status report, PREPA informed the Court that, among other things, it intended to process and submit to COR3 for reimbursement the remaining approximately\n$81 million in approved, but unpaid invoices. In addition, the parties informed the Court that the parties were engaged in mediation to resolve open disputes with respect to\nother unpaid invoices. On October 19, 2023, the Court entered an order continuing the stay through the earlier of January 31, 2024, and the termination of the mediation,\ndirecting the parties to file a further status report with the Court by December 1, 2023, and if the disputes have not been resolved through payment or mediation by January 15,\n2024, directed the parties to file a status report by January 16, 2024. On December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller, and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into the Assignment\nAgreement with SPCP Group. Under the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, Cobra transferred to SPCP Group all of its rights, title and interest in\n$54.4 million of outstanding accounts receivable with PREPA and received net proceeds of $46.1 million. See below for additional information. On December 4, 2023,\nfollowing submission of a joint status report by Cobra and FEMA on December 1, 2023, in which, among other things, PREPA reported that they submitted a request for\nreimbursement to COR3 on November 1, 2023 for $82.4 million and is disputing approximately $1.5 million of invoices from Cobra, the Court ordered PREPA to provide a\ndetailed summary of each of their objections to the disputed amounts and directed the parties to report the status of any remaining unpaid approved invoices in connection with\nthe status report due on January 16, 2024. On January 16, 2024, the parties filed a joint status report in which, among other things, PREPA reported that on December 28,\n2023, it received a disbursement from COR3 for the amount requested on November 1, 2023 and was in the process of paying Cobra’s assignee approximately $13.4 million,\nwhich was paid to SPCP Group on January 18, 2023. Additionally, PREPA reported that it received an order from the Humacao Superior Court requiring it to withhold\napproximately $9.0 million from any payment otherwise due to Cobra stemming from an alleged unpaid debt of municipal and construction excise taxes and noted that it is\naware of twelve Puerto Rico Superior Court cases filed against Cobra by different municipalities relating to the same alleged claims for municipal and construction excise\ntaxes, which, in aggregate, total approximately $70.4 million. See below for a more detailed discussion of claims alleging Cobra’s failure to pay construction excise and volume\nof business taxes. As a result of these alleged claims, PREPA informed the Court that it will withhold the release of any further funds to Cobra. Cobra believes it is exempt\nfrom the construction excise taxes and strongly disagrees with PREPA’s decision to withhold funds. On January 17, 2024, Cobra filed a Writ of Certiorari requesting the Court\nof Appeals to reverse the order from the Humacao Superior Court. On February 15, 2024, Cobra’s request was granted by the Court of Appeals and the order instructing\nPREPA to withhold the $9.0 million payment from Cobra was revoked. The case was remanded to the lower Court for continuation of the proceedings in accordance with the\nCourt of Appeals’ order. The municipality has 15 days to request reconsideration. On January 19, 2024, the Court extended the stay through April 5, 2024, and directed the\nparties to file a joint status report addressing (i) the status of any administrative appeals in connection with the November 2022 and December 2022 determination memoranda\nregarding the second contract, (ii) the status of any remaining approved, but unpaid invoices, and (iii) whether the parties are actively engaged in mediation to resolve their\noutstanding issues by March 27, 2024. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable, of which $9.6 million\nwas paid to Cobra and $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group, as Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s\nobligations to SPCP Group under the Assignment Agreement, and the Assignment Agreement was terminated.\nOn December 28, 2019, Gulfport filed a lawsuit against Stingray Pressure Pumping in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the complaint, Gulfport sought\nto terminate the October 1, 2014, Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement for Pressure Pumping Services between Gulfport and Stingray Pressure Pumping\n(“MSA”). In addition, Gulfport alleged breach of contract and sought damages for alleged overpayments and audit costs under the\nF-36\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMSA and other fees and expenses associated with this lawsuit. On March 26, 2020, Stingray Pressure Pumping filed a counterclaim against Gulfport seeking to recover unpaid\nfees and expenses due to Stingray Pressure Pumping under the MSA. In September 2020, Muskie filed a lawsuit against Gulfport to recover delinquent payments due under a\nnatural sand proppant supply contract. These matters were automatically stayed as a result of Gulfport’s bankruptcy filing on November 13, 2020, seeking voluntary relief\nunder chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Gulfport emerged from bankruptcy on May 17, 2021. On March 22, 2021, Gulfport listed the Stingray Pressure Pumping and Muskie\ncontracts on its master rejection schedule filed with the bankruptcy court. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company recognized unliquidated damages of approximately\n$46.4 million and recorded reserves on these unliquidated damages as a reduction to revenue of $27.1 million and to bad debt expense of $3.8 million. Also during the first\nquarter of 2021, the Company recorded additional reserves on its pre-petition products and services and interest receivables of $6.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. On\nSeptember 21, 2021, the Company and Gulfport reached a settlement under which all litigation relating to the Stingray Pressure Pumping contract and the Muskie contract was\nterminated, Stingray Pressure Pumping released all claims against Gulfport and its subsidiaries with respect to Gulfport’s bankruptcy proceedings, each of the parties released\nall claims they had against the others with respect to the litigation matters discussed above and Muskie retained an allowed general unsecured claim against Gulfport of\n$3.1 million. As a result, during 2021, the Company wrote off its remaining receivable related to the Stingray Pressure Pumping claim resulting in bad debt expense and other\nexpense of $31.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and recorded additional bad debt expense related to the Muskie claim totaling $0.2 million.\nOn January 21, 2020, MasTec Renewables Puerto Rico, LLC (“MasTec”) filed a lawsuit against Mammoth Inc. and Cobra in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida. MasTec’s complaint asserted claims against the Company and Cobra Acquisitions for violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(“RICO”), tortious interference and violations of Puerto Rico law. MasTec alleged that it sustained injuries to its business and property in an unspecified amount because it lost\nthe opportunity to perform work in connection with rebuilding the energy infrastructure in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria under a services contract with a maximum value\nof $500 million due to the Company’s and Cobra’s wrongful interference, payment of bribes, and other inducement to a FEMA official. On April 1, 2020, the defendants filed\na motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 14, 2020, the Court dismissed the RICO claims, and on November 18, 2020, dismissed the claims arising under the Puerto Rico\nstatute and the cause of action for tortious interference with MasTec’s contract (but not its business relations), and dismissed Mammoth Inc. from the litigation. On August 2,\n2021, in order to avoid the risks of further litigation, and with no admission of wrongdoing whatsoever, the Company reached an agreement to settle this matter. Under the\nterms of the agreement, Cobra paid $6.5 million to MasTec on August 2, 2021 and the Company guaranteed payment, by Cobra, of $9.25 million on both August 1, 2022 and\nDecember 1, 2022. The agreement specified interest rates between 6% and 12%. The settlement amount and legal expenses related to the matter of $25.0 million and\n$5.4 million, respectively, are reflected in “other income, net” in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCobra made the second installment payment, including accrued interest, to MasTec on August 23, 2022, the final installment principal payment to MasTec on October 24, 2022\nand the final installment interest payment to MasTec on December 1, 2022.\nOn May 13, 2021, Foreman Electric Services, Inc. (“Foreman”) filed a petition against Mammoth Inc. and Cobra in the Oklahoma County District Court (Oklahoma State\nCourt). The petition asserted claims against the Company and Cobra under federal RICO statutes and certain state-law causes of action. Foreman alleged that it sustained\ninjuries to its business and property in the amount of $250 million due to the Company’s and Cobra’s alleged wrongful interference by means of inducements to a FEMA\nofficial. On May 18, 2021, the Company removed this action to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and filed a motion to dismiss on July 8,\n2021. On July 29, 2021, Foreman voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice. On December 14, 2021, Foreman re-filed its petition against Mammoth Inc. and Cobra in\nthe Oklahoma County District Court (Oklahoma State Court). On December 16, 2021, the Company again removed this action to the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Oklahoma. Foreman filed a motion to remand this action back to Oklahoma County District Court, which was granted on May 5, 2022. On September 28,\n2023, the Company moved to dismiss the petition. On November 16, 2023, rather than respond to the motion, Foreman filed an Amended Petition naming Arty Straehla, Mark\nLayton and Wexford as additional defendants, added claims for fraudulent transfer arising out of the refinancing of certain debt and sought receivership over Mammoth and\nCobra related to allegedly fraudulently transferred assets. The defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Petition, and the motion is set to be heard on March 12, 2024. On\nFebruary 8, 2024, Foreman filed a Motion for Appointment of Receiver. Mammoth’s response to this motion is due by March 1, 2024. The Company believes these claims are\nwithout merit and will vigorously defend the action. Additionally, on February 6, 2023, Foreman moved to amend a complaint against the former president of Cobra filed in\nFlorida State Court arising from facts similar to those in the pending Oklahoma action to add, as defendants, Arty Straehla and Mark Layton. On September 15, 2023, Straehla\nand Layton\nF-37\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmoved to dismiss the complaint. On January 18, 2024, Foreman voluntarily dismissed the Florida State Court action against Straehla and Layton. In a related matter, on January\n12, 2022, a Derivative Complaint on behalf of nominal defendant Machine Learning Integration, LLC (“MLI”), which alleges it would have served as a sub-contractor to\nForeman in Puerto Rico, was filed against the Company and Cobra in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging essentially the same facts as Foreman’s\naction and asserting violations of federal RICO statutes and certain non-federal claims. MLI alleges it sustained injuries to its business and property in an unspecified amount\nbecause the Company’s and Cobra’s wrongful interference by means of inducements to a FEMA official prevented Foreman from obtaining work, and thereby prevented MLI,\nas Foreman’s subcontractor, from obtaining work. These matters are still in the early stages and at this time, the Company is not able to predict the outcome of these claims or\nwhether they will have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is routinely involved in state and local tax audits. During 2015, the State of Ohio assessed taxes on the purchase of equipment the Company believes is exempt\nunder state law. The Company appealed the assessment and a hearing was held in 2017. As a result of the hearing, the Company received a decision from the State of Ohio,\nwhich the Company appealed. On February 25, 2022, the Company received an unfavorable decision on the appeal. The Company appealed the decision. On August 2, 2023,\nthe Ohio Supreme court affirmed the ruling in part and reversed the ruling in part. The Company is currently awaiting the final assessment. It is not expected to have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCobra has been served with 13 lawsuits from municipalities in Puerto Rico alleging failure to pay construction excise and volume of business taxes. These matters are in\nvarious stages in the applicable courts in Puerto Rico. On November 14, 2022, the Puerto Rico Superior Court entered judgment against Cobra in connection with one of the\nlawsuits ordering payment of approximately $9.0 million. On January 9, 2023, Cobra appealed the judgment and, on March 20, 2023, the Court confirmed the imposition of\napproximately $8.5 million related to construction excise taxes. On April 10, 2023, Cobra appealed this judgment, which was denied on May 5, 2023. Cobra filed a motion for\nreconsideration on May 15, 2023, which was denied. Cobra filed a second motion for reconsideration on June 22, 2023 and is currently awaiting a decision. On December 18,\n2023, the Humacao Superior Court issued an order to PREPA to withhold payment of approximately $9.0 million to Cobra. On January 17, 2024, Cobra filed a Writ of\nCertiorari requesting the Court of Appeals to reverse the order from the Humacao Superior Court. On February 15, 2024, Cobra’s request was granted by the Court of Appeals\nand the order instructing PREPA to withhold the $9.0 million payment from Cobra was revoked. The case was remanded to the lower Court for continuation of the proceedings\nin accordance with the Court of Appeals’ order. The municipality has 15 days to request reconsideration. Cobra believes it is exempt from the construction excise taxes. To the\nextent Cobra receives an unfavorable judgment, the Company believes that any such taxes in the judgment that relate to the Emergency Master Service Agreement with PREPA\nexecuted on October 19, 2017, would be reimbursable to Cobra. At this time, the Company is not able to predict the outcome of these matters or whether they will have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn April 16, 2019, Christopher Williams, a former employee of Higher Power Electrical, LLC, filed a putative class and collective action complaint titled Christopher\nWilliams, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Higher Power Electrical, LLC, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, and Cobra Energy LLC in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico. On June 24, 2019, the complaint was amended to replace Mr. Williams with Matthew Zeisset as the named plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges\nthe defendant failed to pay overtime wages to a class of workers in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act and Puerto Rico law. On August 21, 2019, upon request of the\nparties, the Court stayed proceedings in the lawsuit and administratively closed the case pending completion of individual arbitration proceedings initiated by Mr. Zeisset and\nopt-in plaintiffs. Other claimants have subsequently initiated additional individual arbitration proceedings asserting similar claims. During 2023, the Company agreed to\nsettlements in principle with a portion of the claimants. Arbitrations remain pending for the remaining claimants. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the\narbitrations. During 2023, the Company recognized an estimated liability related to these complaints, which is included in “accounts payable” in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The amount required to resolve these matters may ultimately increase or decrease from the Company’s estimated amount as\nthe matters progress.\nOn September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico unsealed an indictment that charged the former president of Cobra Acquisitions LLC with\nconspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. Two other individuals were also charged in the indictment. The indictment is focused on the interactions between a\nformer FEMA official and the former president of Cobra. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries were charged in the indictment. On May 18, 2022, the former FEMA\nofficial and the former president of Cobra each pled guilty to one-count information charging gratuities related to a project that Cobra never bid upon and was never awarded or\nreceived any monies for. On December 13, 2022, the Court sentenced the former Cobra president to custody of the Bureau of Prisons\nF-38\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and one day and a fine of $25,000. The Court sentenced the FEMA official to custody of the Bureau of\nPrisons for six months and one day, a term of supervised release of six months and a fine of $15,000. The Court also dismissed the indictment against the two defendants. The\nCompany does not expect any additional activity in the criminal proceeding. Given the uncertainty inherent in criminal litigation, however, it is not possible at this time to\ndetermine the potential impacts that the sentencings could have on the Company. PREPA has stated in Court filings that it may contend the alleged criminal activity affects\nCobra’s entitlement to payment under its contracts with PREPA. It is unclear what PREPA’s position will be going forward. Subsequent to the indictment, Cobra received a\ncivil investigative demand (“CID”) from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which requests certain documents and answers to specific interrogatories relevant to\nan ongoing investigation it is conducting. The aforementioned DOJ investigation is in connection with the issues raised in the criminal matter. Cobra is cooperating with the\nDOJ and is not able to predict the outcome of this investigation or if it will have a material impact on Cobra’s or the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows. With regard to the SEC investigation disclosed in previous filings, on July 6, 2022, the SEC sent a letter saying that it had concluded its investigation\nas to the Company and that based on information the SEC has as of this date, it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company.\nOn September 12, 2019, AL Global Services, LLC (“Alpha Lobo”) filed a second amended third-party petition against the Company in an action styled Jim Jorrie v. Craig\nCharles, Julian Calderas, Jr., and AL Global Services, LLC v. Jim Jorrie v. Cobra Acquisitions LLC v. ESPADA Logistics & Security Group, LLC, ESPADA Caribbean LLC,\nArty Straehla, Ken Kinsey, Jennifer Jorrie, and Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., in the 57th Judicial District in Bexar County, Texas. The petition alleges that the Company\nshould be held vicariously liable under alter ego, agency and respondeat superior theories for Alpha Lobo’s alleged claims against Cobra and Arty Straehla for aiding and\nabetting, knowing participation in and conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty in connection with Cobra’s execution of an agreement with ESPADA Caribbean, LLC for security\nservices related to Cobra’s work in Puerto Rico. The trial court granted Cobra, Mammoth and Straehla’s motion to compel Alpha Lobo’s claims against them to arbitration.\nHowever, Alpha Lobo has not yet brought its claims in arbitration. Instead, on March 22, 2022, Alpha Lobo filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Fourth Court of\nAppeals, San Antonio, Texas, seeking to overturn the order compelling arbitration. The appellate court denied the Mandamus on May 4, 2022, without requesting a response.\nOn June 28, 2022, Alpha Lobo filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Texas Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the order compelling arbitration. The Texas Supreme\nCourt denied the Mandamus on August 5, 2022, without requesting a response. Alpha Lobo has not yet brought its claims in arbitration. The Company believes these claims\nare without merit and will vigorously defend the action. However, at this time, the Company is not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or whether it will have a material\nimpact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, there was a parallel arbitration proceeding in which certain Defendants\nwere seeking a declaratory judgment regarding Cobra’s rights to terminate the Alpha Lobo contract and enter into a new contract with a third-party. On June 24, 2021, the\narbitration panel ruled in favor of Cobra.\nThe Company is involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, legal\nmatters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAssignment Agreement\nOn December 1, 2023, Cobra, as seller and Mammoth, as guarantor, entered into the Assignment Agreement with SPCP Group, as purchaser.\nUnder the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, Cobra transferred to SPCP Group, at the purchase rate of8 8.0% and free and clear of any liens and claims, all of\nits rights, title and interest in the first $63.0 million (the “Transferred Amount”) of the total outstanding accounts receivable that remained unpaid by PREPA as of October 6,\n2023 (the “PREPA Claim”), received or to be received by Cobra on or after October 6, 2023. Between October 6, 2023 and December 1, 2023, Cobra received payments from\nPREPA with respect to the PREPA Claim totaling $8.6 million (the “Interim Payment Amount”), resulting in the net Transferred Amount of $54.4 million.\nUnder the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, any portion of the Transferred Amount that remains outstanding from PREPA from and after March 31, 2024\nwill thereafter increase monthly at a rate of 1% per month, compounded. Any amount received with respect to the PREPA Claim in excess of the Transferred Amount will be\nfor the benefit of Cobra. If (i) it is determined by a final order of any court of competent jurisdiction that the PREPA Claim is subject to any defense, claim or right of setoff,\nreduction, avoidance, disallowance, subordination, disgorgement,\nF-39\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrecharacterization, adversary proceeding or other impairment, whether on contractual, legal or equitable grounds, resulting in the PREPA Claim being disallowed or allowed in\nan amount less than the Transferred Amount, or (ii) Cobra consents to, or enters into a settlement agreement with PREPA for, the payment that is, in an aggregate amount, less\nthan the Transferred Amount or is otherwise adversely impacting SPCP Group’s rights transferred under the Assignment Agreement, Cobra has agreed to repurchase within 18\nmonths and one day from the receipt of SPCP Group’s written demand, the unpaid portion of the Transferred Amount subject to such disallowance or impairment, multiplied\nby the purchase rate, plus interest accruing, subject to certain tolling provisions, at a rate of 6% per annum from December 1, 2023 through and including the date of such\nrepurchase.\nIn connection with the entry into the Assignment Agreement, Mammoth and Cobra obtained the required consents from lenders under the Company’s revolving credit facility\nwith Fifth Third Bank and the Company’s term loan and security agreement with Wexford. Further, under the term loan and security agreement with Wexford, Mammoth is\nrequired, among other things, to mandatorily remit to Wexford up to 50% of all amounts that constitute PREPA Claim proceeds, including the proceeds received by Cobra\nunder the Assignment Agreement, to reduce outstanding borrowings under such term loan and security agreement, which requirement was waived by Wexford in connection\nwith the Assignment Agreement.\nThe net proceeds received by Cobra in connection with the Assignment Agreement were $46.1 million. The Company elected the fair value option for measuring the liability to\nsimplify the accounting associated with the Assignment Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the liability was approximately $48.9 million, which is included\nin “accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the aggregate unpaid principal balance related to this liability was $54.4\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a financing charge totaling $2.8 million, which is included in “interest expense and financing\ncharges, net” in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, PREPA paid $64.0 million with respect to the outstanding PREPA receivable. Of the $64.0 million, $54.4 million was paid to SPCP Group,\nas Cobra’s assignee under the Assignment Agreement, which fully extinguished Cobra’s and Mammoth’s obligations to SPCP Group under the Assignment Agreement, and the\nAssignment Agreement was terminated. The remaining $9.6 million was paid to Cobra. The Company expects to recognize a financing charge totaling approximately $5.5\nmillion during the first quarter of 2024 related to the termination of the Assignment Agreement.\nDefined contribution plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan for the benefit of substantially all employees at their date of hire. The plan allows eligible employees to contribute\nup to 92% of their annual compensation, not to exceed annual limits established by the federal government. The Company makes discretionary matching contributions of up\nto 3% of an employee’s compensation and may make additional discretionary contributions for eligible employees. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nCompany paid $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in contributions to the plan.\n21. Reporting Segments and Geographic Areas\nReporting Segments\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s revenues, income before income taxes and identifiable assets are primarily attributable tof our reportable segments. The Company\nprincipally provides services in connection with on-shore drilling of oil and natural gas wells for small to large domestic independent oil and natural gas producers as well as\nelectric infrastructure services to private utilities, public investor-owned utilities and co-operative utilities.\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer comprise the Company’s CODM. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the CODM\nmanages the segments, evaluates the segment financial statements and makes key operating and resource utilization decisions. Segment evaluation is determined on a\nquantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss) less impairment expense, as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and\ntypes of customers.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s four reportable segments include well completion services (“Well Completion”), infrastructure services (“Infrastructure”), natural\nsand proppant services (“Sand”) and drilling services (“Drilling”). The Well Completion segment provides hydraulic fracturing and water transfer services primarily in the\nF-40\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUtica Shale of Eastern Ohio, Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the mid-continent region. The Sand segment mines, processes and sells sand for use in hydraulic fracturing.\nThe Infrastructure segment provides electric utility infrastructure services to government-funded utilities, private utilities, public investor-owned utilities and co-operative\nutilities in the northeastern, southwestern, midwestern and western portions of the United States. The Sand segment primarily services the Utica Shale, Permian Basin, SCOOP,\nSTACK and Montney Shale in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. During certain of the periods presented, the Drilling segment provided contract land and directional\ndrilling services primarily in the Permian Basin and mid-continent region. In 2022, the Company included Bison Trucking in its Drilling segment. Based on its assessment of\nFASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, guidance at December 31, 2023, the Company changed its presentation in 2023 to move Bison Trucking to the reconciling column titled\n“All Other”. The results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect these changes.\nDuring certain of the periods presented, the Company also provided aviation services, equipment rental services, crude oil hauling services, remote accommodation and\nequipment manufacturing. The businesses that provide these services are distinct operating segments, which the CODM reviews independently when making key operating and\nresource utilization decisions. None of these operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds of a reporting segment and do not meet the aggregation criteria set forth in\nFASB ASC 280. Therefore, results for these operating segments are included in the column titled “All Other” in the tables below. Additionally, assets for corporate activities,\nwhich primarily include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, inter-segment accounts receivable, prepaid insurance and certain property and equipment, are included in the\nAll Other column. Although Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, which holds these corporate assets, meets one of the quantitative thresholds of a reporting segment, it does not\nengage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and its results are not regularly reviewed by the Company’s CODM when making key operating and resource\nutilization decisions. Therefore, the Company does not include it as a reportable segment.\nSales from one segment to another are generally priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices. Total revenue and total cost of revenue amounts included in the\nEliminations column in the following tables include inter-segment transactions conducted between segments. Receivables due for sales from one segment to another and for\ncorporate allocations to each segment are included in the Eliminations column for total assets in the following tables. All transactions conducted between segments are\neliminated in consolidation. Transactions conducted by companies within the same reporting segment are eliminated within each reporting segment. The following tables set\nforth certain financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable segments (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Well Completion Infrastructure Sand

Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or\nany regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator must abate the alleged\nviolation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine\naffected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged\nviolation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are\nsometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the\nMSHA inspector(s) assigned.\nMine Safety Data.

This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that\nthe violation has been abated.\n• Section 104(d) Citations and Orders: Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory\nhealth or safety standards.\n• Section 110(b)(2) Violations: Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act.\n• Section 107(a) Orders: Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an “imminent danger” (as defined by\nMSHA) existed.\nThe following table details the violations, citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nProposed\nSection 104 Section Assessments(b)($, Mining\nS&S Section104(b)Orders Section104(d)Citations 110(b)(2) Section107(a)Orders amounts in Related\nMine(a) Citations(#) (#) and Orders(#) Violations(#) (#) dollars) Fatalities (#)\nTaylor, WI — — — — — $ — —\nMenomonie,\nWI — — — — — $ — —\nNew Auburn,\nWI — — — — — $ — —\na. The definition of mine under section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting\nminerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools and minerals preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, any of these other items\nassociated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine and may or may not assign separate\nidentification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number\nbecause that is how we manage and operate our mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on\nMSHA identification numbers.\nb.
