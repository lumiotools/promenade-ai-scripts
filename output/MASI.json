          "content": "Third Quarter 2024 Earnings\nNovember 5, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor Statement\nForward-Looking Statements: This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our\nexpectations, plans, strategies or prospects.We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,” “forecast,”\n“see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.Such statements are based upon the current\nbeliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be\nno assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The\nrisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov,\nwww.masimo.com or upon request.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in\nmaking comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating\nperformance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined\nin accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The\nCompany has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue\n(constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A\nexpense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense,non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment charge, non-GAAP operating expense %\n(prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP non-operating income (expense), non-GAAP provision for\nincome taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated definition),non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and\nupdated definition). These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core operating results with those of other companies.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our\nbusiness. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.investor.masimo.com to\naccess Supplementary Financial Information.\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related\nto acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and related costs; business transition and related costs; litigation related expenses and settlements; realized and unrealized gains or losses; tax\nrelated adjustments; and other adjustments. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable\nforward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions\nis difficult to predict because management's plans may change. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be\nconfusing to investors. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n2\nExecutive Summary\n• Consolidated revenue was $505 million, representing 5% growth on a reported and constant currency(1) basis.\nHealthcare revenue was $343 million, representing 12% growth on a reported and constant currency(1) basis.\no\nNon-Healthcare revenue was $161 million, representing a 6% decline on a reported and constant currency(1) basis.\no\n• Non-GAAP(2) gross margin was 53.9%, representing an improvement of 350 basis points versus prior year.\nThird Quarter\nHealthcare gross margin was 62.9%, representing an improvement of 260 basis points.\no\n2024\nNon-Healthcare gross margin was 34.6%, representing an improvement of 200 basis points.\no\n• Non-GAAP(2) Operating Margin was 16%, representing an improvement of 230 basis points versus prior year.

Annual reported amounts may vary from amounts previously reported due to rounding conventions.\n(2) Effective fiscal year 2024, we are updating our non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of all expenses related to our litigation with Apple. Masimo had previously only excluded the expenses related to the U.S. International Trade Commission\nlitigation against Apple. Masimo believes all Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance and is therefore excluding them from its non-GAAP financial measures.\n(3) Guidance provided November 5, 2024.

Masimo had previously only excluded the expenses related to the U.S. International Trade Commission\nlitigation against Apple. Masimo believes all Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance and is therefore excluding them from its non-GAAP financial measures.\n(3) Guidance provided November 5, 2024.

          "content": "Investor Presentation\nJune 2024\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our expectations, plans, strategies or\nprospects. We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,” “forecast,” “see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,”\n“could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. All\nstatements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs,\nexpectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking\nstatements, since there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking\nstatements contained in this presentation. The risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described\nin Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as\nsubsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in making\ncomparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating\nperformance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of\nfinancial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies. The Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results\non an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-\nGAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A expense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP\nimpairment charge, non-GAAP operating expense % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-\nGAAP non-operating income (expense), non-GAAP provision for income taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated\ndefinition), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and updated definition). This presentation also includes certain preliminary estimated information of a potential\nseparation of the Company’s consumer business for illustrative and informational purposes and further adjusted for separation items. See “Disclaimer Regarding Potential\nSeparation” on the next slide for additional information. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core operating\nresults with those of other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these\nmeasures to better understand and evaluate our business. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of\nthe Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\n2\nDisclaimer Regarding Potential Separation\nOn March 22, 2024, Masimo announced that its Board of Directors has authorized management to evaluate a proposed separation of the company’s consumer business (the\n“Potential Separation”). Masimo’s Board of Directors and management are in the process of evaluating the proposed structure of the Potential Separation. Slides 16-18 of this\npresentation include estimates and projections of the financial impact of the Potential Separation; however, the estimates and projections are being provided solely for illustrative and\ninformational purposes and do not purport to contain or present all information relating to any Potential Separation. Moreover, the method, structure, timing and terms of any\nPotential Separation are still under consideration and have not been determined, approved or finalized, and the final method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation,\nincluding the separation of assets and liabilities, may differ materially from what is presented and estimated on Slides 4 and 15-23 (collectively, the “Separation Discussion Slides”).\nThere can be no assurance that any Potential Separation that may be implemented will be similar in structure to the structure illustrated or discussed on the Separation Discussion\nSlides, that any Potential Separation may be effected at all or the timing of any Potential Separation. Additionally, the estimates on the Separation Discussion Slides are illustrative\nprojections that were calculated using the midpoint of Masimo’s 2024 consolidated guidance, which is based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, but is subject to\nuncertainty and risks, and also relies on a number of assumptions and adjustments as described on the Separation Discussion Slides. Accordingly, all of the information on the\nSeparation Discussion Slides relating to the Potential Separation constitute “forward-looking statements” as described on Slide 2 of this presentation entitled “Safe Harbor\nStatement”.

Masimo expects that any\npotential separation would result in a full deconsolidation of the financial statements for the two businesses.\nMasimo expects that the separated entity (“NewCo”) will include its consumer audio (including hearables) and consumer health products (including the Stork\nbaby monitor and the Freedom smart watch and band). Masimo will retain its professional healthcare and telehealth products.\nAs illustrated above, if a separation is completed, Masimo expects that the separation will improve the profitability of the healthcare business (“RemainCo”).\n• The financial information above reflects a separation of the consumer business without cash proceeds (e.g., spin-off). If a separation transaction (e.g., sale)\nresults in cash proceeds to Masimo, there would be an opportunity to pay down debt (currently ~$876 million) and reduce interest expense (currently ~$47\nmillion, which represents ~$0.63 per share).\n• “Additional Separation Adjustments” above include adjustments for consumer health product revenues, cost of goods sold, research and development\nexpenses, selling and marketing expenses, certain corporate expenses and the assumed sharing of Apple litigation costs (GAAP only) equally between\nRemainCo and NewCo.\nNotes:\n1.

          "content": "Third Quarter 2024 Earnings\nNovember 5, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor Statement\nForward-Looking Statements: This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our\nexpectations, plans, strategies or prospects.We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,” “forecast,”\n“see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.Such statements are based upon the current\nbeliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be\nno assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The\nrisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov,\nwww.masimo.com or upon request.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in\nmaking comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating\nperformance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined\nin accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The\nCompany has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue\n(constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A\nexpense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense,non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment charge, non-GAAP operating expense %\n(prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP non-operating income (expense), non-GAAP provision for\nincome taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated definition),non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and\nupdated definition). These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core operating results with those of other companies.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our\nbusiness. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.investor.masimo.com to\naccess Supplementary Financial Information.\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related\nto acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and related costs; business transition and related costs; litigation related expenses and settlements; realized and unrealized gains or losses; tax\nrelated adjustments; and other adjustments. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable\nforward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions\nis difficult to predict because management's plans may change.

Shipments of noninvasive technology boards and instruments were 60,500. GAAP operating income was $30.1\nmillion and non-GAAP(1) operating income was $80.8 million. GAAP net income was $9.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP(1) net income was $52.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share.\nMichelle Brennan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Masimo, said, “We are pleased to report strong third quarter performance,\ndriven by our core healthcare segment. We appreciate the commitment and energy of our employees, which has resulted in a\nseamless transition since our Annual Meeting with no disruption to our business or departures of critical talent. Our focus is on\npositioning Masimo to achieve its significant long-term growth potential by capitalizing on the many opportunities we see ahead\nof us, including through our ongoing review of the product portfolio and R&D projects. We are allocating resources to fewer\nprojects, concentrating on sizable market opportunities that address clear unmet needs, and reducing spending in areas that are\nnot contributing to our long-term growth objectives. We are also progressing on our strategic review of the consumer business\nand are focused on delivering the best outcome for our shareholders. We are confident in our position as we approach the end of\n2024, as demonstrated by our increased full-year non-GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance. With the support of our talented\nteam and our newly expanded Board, we will continue to execute on our strategy while enhancing shareholder value as we look\nto next year and beyond.”\n2024 Financial Guidance\nThe Company provided the following non-GAAP(2) estimates for its fourth quarter 2024 and updated full-year 2024 guidance:\nFY 2024\nQ4 2024 Updated FY 2024\n(in millions, except earnings per diluted share) Guidance(3) Guidance(3) Prior Guidance(4)\n$2,075 to $2,085 to\nConsolidated revenue $581 to $611 $2,105 $2,135\n$1,390 to $1,385 to\nHealthcare revenue $363 to $373 $1,400 $1,405\nNon-healthcare revenue $218 to $238 $685 to $705 $700 to $730\nNon-GAAP(2) operating income $103 to $114 $325 to $336 $317 to $330\nNon-GAAP(2) earnings per diluted share $1.35 to $1.50 $3.95 to $4.10 $3.80 to $4.00\n____________________________\n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure for which a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in this press\nrelease.\n(2) Financial guidance includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for which reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures are not available without unreasonable efforts. See “Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below, which identifies the information\nthat is unavailable without unreasonable efforts and provides additional information.

A replay of the webcast and conference call will be available shortly after the\nconclusion of the call and will be archived on the Company’s website.\nWebsite Information\nTo access important information relating to Masimo’s third quarter 2024 investor conference call, including the audio webcast\nand investor presentation, please visit the Investor Relations section of Masimo’s website at https://investor.masimo.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items described below. Management\nbelieves that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results.\nFurthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the\noperations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTherefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to,\nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the\nCompany may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s net operating\nresults on an on-going basis: (i) constant currency revenue growth percentage, (ii) non-GAAP net income (prior definition and\nupdated definition), (iii) non-GAAP (net income) earnings per diluted share (prior definition and updated definition) and (iv) non-\nGAAP operating income/margin (prior definition and updated definition). These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist\ninvestors in making comparisons of the Company’s operating results with those of other companies. Management believes\nconstant currency revenue growth, non-GAAP operating income/margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per\ndiluted share are important measures in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better\nunderstand and evaluate our business.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for the following items:\nConstant currency revenue adjustments\nSome of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign\ncurrency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary significantly from period-to-period depending on the average and\nquarter-end exchange rates during a respective period. We believe that comparing these foreign currency denominated revenues\nby holding the exchange rates constant with the prior year period is useful to management and investors in evaluating our revenue\ngrowth rates on a period-to-period basis. We anticipate that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the related constant currency\nadjustments for calculation of our revenue growth rate will continue to occur in future periods.\nAcquired tangible asset amortization\nThese transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with acquired\ntangible assets and asset valuation step-ups.\nBusiness transition and related costs\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with business transition plans. These items may\ninclude but are not limited to severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, asset impairment, and other related costs to\nrationalize our operational footprint and optimize business results.\n-2-\nAcquired intangible asset amortization\nThese transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with acquired\nintangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property, trade names and non-competition\nagreements.\nAcquisitions, integrations, divestitures, and related costs\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with acquisitions, integrations, investments,\ndivestitures, assets impairments, and in-process research and development.\nLitigation related expenses and settlements (prior definition)\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with certain litigation matters, which can vary in\ntheir characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results.\nLitigation related expenses and settlements (updated definition)\nWe have been engaged in various legal proceedings against Apple since January 2020, including various proceedings in the\nfederal courts, various proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO proceedings”), and a proceeding in the\nU.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC proceeding”). Although we previously excluded only expenses relating to the\nITC proceeding from the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements”, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we\nhave revised the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements” to exclude not only expenses relating to the ITC\nproceeding, but also all other Apple litigation expenses, including those relating to the federal court proceedings and the PTO\nproceedings. We believe all of the Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going\noperating performance, and this updated definition will provide more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our financial performance that otherwise may be obscured by the significant fluctuations in Apple-related\nlitigation expenses.\nOther adjustments\nIn the event there are gains, losses and other adjustments which impact period-to-period comparability and do not represent the\nunderlying ongoing results of the business, the Company may choose to exclude these from non-GAAP earnings.\nRealized and unrealized gains or losses\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with foreign currency denominated transactions and\ninvestments. Changes in the underlying currency rates relative to the U.S. Dollar may result in realized and unrealized foreign\ncurrency gains and losses between the time these receivables and payables arise and the time that they are settled in cash.\nUnrealized and realized gains and losses on investments may impact the Company’s reported results of operations for a period.\nThese items are highly variable, difficult to predict and outside the control of those responsible for the underlying operations of\nthe business. Other items also included here are mark-to-market gains and losses of derivative contracts that are not designated\nas hedging instruments or the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges.\nFinancing related adjustments\nThe Company may enter into various financial arrangements whereby costs are incurred and certain instrument features are valued\nand expensed accordingly but are not necessarily indicative of the on-going cash flow generation of the Company and therefore\nexcludes these costs from non-GAAP earnings. For GAAP earnings per diluted share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the\nanti-dilutive impact, if applicable, in its diluted shares calculations. However, the Company believes that reflecting the anti-\ndilutive impact of these instruments in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provides management and investors with useful\ninformation in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis.\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments\nIn order to reflect the tax effected impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, the Company will adjust the non-GAAP earnings by the\napproximate tax impact of these adjustments.\n-3-\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense\nGAAP requires that excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense be reflected in our provision for income\ntaxes rather than paid-in capital. As these excess tax benefits may be highly variable from period-to-period, the Company may\nchoose to exclude these tax benefits from non-GAAP earnings to facilitate comparability between periods and with peers.\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For\ninstance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related to acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and related costs; business\ntransition and related costs; litigation related expenses and settlements; realized and unrealized gains or losses; tax related\nadjustments; and other adjustments. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are\nnot available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to\npredict because management's plans may change. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree\nof precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or\nanticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements including, in particular, the statements about our expectations regarding our fourth-\nquarter 2024 and updated full-year 2024 financial guidance, including GAAP and non-GAAP consolidated revenue, healthcare revenue, non-healthcare revenue,\nconsolidated operating income and consolidated earnings per diluted share. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations\nand beliefs and are subject to uncertainties and factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual\nresults to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, those related to: our\ndependence on Masimo SET® and Masimo rainbow SET™ products and technologies for substantially all of our revenue; any failure in protecting our intellectual\nproperty exposure to competitors’ assertions of intellectual property claims; the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we sell our products and\ntechnologies; any failure to continue developing innovative products and technologies; our ability to successfully integrate Sound United’s brands into our\nbusiness; our ability to address and expand into new markets; the lack of acceptance of any of our current or future products and technologies; obtaining regulatory\napproval of our current and future products and technologies; the risk that the implementation of our international realignment will not continue to produce\nanticipated operational and financial benefits, including a continued lower effective tax rate; the loss of our customers; the failure to retain and recruit senior\nmanagement; matters relating to future board and management leadership; product liability claims exposure; a failure to obtain expected returns from the amount\nof intangible assets we have recorded; the maintenance of our brand; the amount and type of equity awards that we may grant to employees and service providers\nin the future; our ongoing litigation and related matters; the ability to effect any potential separation of our consumer business described above and to meet any\nof the conditions related thereto; the approval of any such potential separation by Masimo’s board of directors; the ability of any separated businesses to be\nsuccessful; potential uncertainty during the pendency of any such potential separation that could affect Masimo’s financial performance; the possibility that any\npotential separation will not be completed within the anticipated time period or at all; the possibility that any such potential separation will not achieve its intended\nbenefits; the possibility of disruption, including changes to existing business relationships, disputes, litigation or unanticipated costs in connection with any such\npotential separation; the impact on our employees; the uncertainty of the expected financial performance of Masimo prior to and following completion of any\nsuch potential separation; negative effects of the announcement or pendency of any such potential separation on the market price of Masimo’s securities and/or\non the financial performance of Masimo; evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes; changes in general economic and/or industry specific conditions; actions by\nthird parties, including government agencies; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, all of which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know whether our expectations\nwill prove correct. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, even if subsequently\nmade available by us on our website or otherwise. We do not undertake any obligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as\na result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under

Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\n1. Description of the Company\nMasimo Corporation is a global technology company that develops, manufactures and markets a wide array of patient monitoring technologies, as well as\nautomation and connectivity solutions. The Company’s mission is to improve patient outcomes, reduce the cost of care and take noninvasive monitoring to new\nsites and applications. The Company operates two business segments: healthcare and non-healthcare.\nThe Company’s healthcare products and patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor or circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable\nsensors, software and/or cables. The Company primarily sells its healthcare products to hospitals, emergency medical service providers, home care providers,\nphysician offices, veterinarians, long-term care facilities and consumers through its direct sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\npartners.\nOn April 11, 2022, the Company acquired Viper Holdings Corporation, the parent company of DEI Sales, Inc., d/b/a Sound United (Sound United), via the\nCompany’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Boom Acquisition Corp (Sonic) (Sound United Acquisition). For additional information on the Company’s\nacquisition of Sound United, see Note 18, “Business Combinations”.\nThe Company’s non-healthcare consumer products and home integration technologies are primarily sold or licensed direct-to-consumers, or through authorized\nretailers and wholesalers.\nThe terms “the Company” and “Masimo” refer to Masimo Corporation and, where applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of\nmanagement, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the Company’s condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements at that date. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (fiscal year 2023), filed\nwith the SEC on February 28, 2024. The results for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 (fiscal year 2024) or for any other interim period or for any future year.\nFiscal Periods\nThe Company follows a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year. Under a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year, a 52 week fiscal year includes four quarters of 13\nweeks while a 53 week fiscal year includes three 13 week fiscal quarters and one 14 week fiscal quarter. The Company’s last 53 week fiscal year was fiscal\nyear 2020. Fiscal year 2024 is a 52 week fiscal year ending December 28, 2024. All references to years in these notes to condensed consolidated financial\nstatements are fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation,\nincluding certain balance sheet asset accounts in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2023. There was no impact on\npreviously reported total assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity or net income.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include the determination of standalone selling prices, variable consideration, total\nconsideration allocated to each performance obligation within a contract, inventory valuation, valuation of the Company’s equity awards, valuation of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities connected with business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; derivative and equity\ninstruments, deferred taxes and any associated valuation allowances, deferred revenue, accounting for pensions, uncertain income tax positions, litigation costs,\nand related accruals. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” for further details. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 805, Business Combinations, which requires that once control is obtained, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquired\nentity, if applicable, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with the exception of acquired contract assets and contract liabilities\n(i.e., deferred revenue) from contracts with customers. These are recognized and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, if applicable, is\nrecorded as goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company accounts for certain financial instruments at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company determines the fair\nvalue of its financial instruments using the framework prescribed by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and considers the estimated\namount the Company would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and the Company’s creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, the\nCompany may utilize financial models to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. In doing so, the Company uses inputs that include quoted prices\nfor similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs\nfor the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurement\nOn a recurring basis, the Company measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted\nmarket prices or other observable inputs are not available, the Company applies valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Authoritative guidance describes a\nfair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\n● Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n● Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following tables represent the Company’s financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 28, 2024:\nFair Value Measurement Hierarchy\nTotal Carrying\n(in millions) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 101.2 $ 101.2 $ — $ —\nMoney market funds 57.3 57.3 — —\nEquity securities 1.7 1.7 — —\nPension assets 25.6 18.8 6.8 —\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges(1) 4.7 4.7 — —\nDerivative instruments - warrants 0.9 0.9 — —\nTotal assets $ 191.4 $ 184.6 $ 6.8 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges $ 4.9 $ 4.9 $ — $ —\nTotal liabilities $ 4.9 $ 4.9 $ — $ —\nThe following tables represent the Company’s financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 30, 2023:\nFair Value Measurement Hierarchy\nTotal Carrying\n(in millions) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 87.0 $ 87.0 $ — $ —\nMoney market funds 76.0 76.0 — —\nPension assets 23.1 16.8 6.3 —\nEquity securities 1.7 1.7 — —\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges(1) 11.6 11.6 — —\nDerivative instruments - warrants 1.0 1.0 — —\nTotal assets $ 200.4 $ 194.1 $ 6.3 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges $ 3.6 $ 3.6 $ — $ —\nTotal liabilities $ 3.6 $ 3.6 $ — $ —\n______________\n(1) Includes accrued interest.\nThe Company invests in checking, savings and money market fund accounts, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued\nusing quoted market prices. These investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents within the Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and its accounting policies.\n11\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company has certain strategic investments in privately-held companies (non-marketable equity securities) and companies that have completed initial\npublic offerings (marketable equity securities). The Company’s marketable equity securities, whose price is based on quoted market price in an active market,\nare classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities are classified as current, short-term investments, or non-current, recorded in other\nnon-current assets, based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The changes in the fair value of those equity\nsecurities are measured at each reporting date and changes in the value of these investments between reporting dates are recorded within non-operating loss.\nThe Company’s pension assets consist of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. The fair value of Level 2 assets is based on observable inputs such as prices or\nquotes for similar assets, adjusted for any differences in terms or conditions that may affect the value of the instrument being valued. The valuation techniques\nused for Level 2 assets may include the use of models or other valuation techniques, but these methods are all based on observable market inputs.\nThe Company also has investments in certain derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nFor certain other financial assets and liabilities, including restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities, the\ncarrying amounts approximate their fair value primarily due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. The Company also measures certain non-\nfinancial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, in connection with periodic\nevaluations for potential impairment.\nFurthermore, the Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to specific assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company did not have\nany transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less, or highly liquid investments\nthat are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, to be cash equivalents. The Company carries cash and cash equivalents at cost, which approximates\nfair value, and they are Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable consist of trade receivables recorded at the time of invoicing of product sales, reduced by reserves for estimated bad debts and returns.\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial\ncondition. Collateral is generally not required. The Company records an allowance for credit losses that it does not expect to collect based on relevant\ninformation, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts are charged off against the allowance when\nthe Company believes they are uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist.\nBased on the risk characteristics, the Company has identified U.S. and international customers as separate portfolios for both segments, and measures expected\ncredit losses on such receivables using an aging methodology.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates the first in, first out\nmethod, and includes material, labor and overhead costs. Inventory valuation adjustments are recorded for inventory items that have become excess or obsolete\nor are no longer used in current production and for inventory items that have a market price less than the carrying value in inventory. The Company generally\ndetermines inventory valuation adjustments based on an evaluation of the expected future use of its inventory on an item by item basis and applies historical\nobsolescence rates to estimate the loss on inventory expected to have a recovery value below cost. The Company also records other specific inventory valuation\nadjustments when it becomes aware of unique events or circumstances that result in an expected recovery value below cost. For inventory items that have been\nwritten down, the reduced value becomes the new cost basis.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nUseful Lives\nBuildings and building improvements 7 to 39 years\nComputer equipment and software 2 to 12 years\nDemonstration units 2 to 3 years\nFurniture and office equipment 2 to 15 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or term of lease\nMachinery, equipment and tooling 3 to 20 years\nOperating lease assets Lesser of useful life or term of lease\nTransportation, vehicles and other 1 to 20 years\nLand is not depreciated and construction-in-progress is not depreciated until placed in service. Normal repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred,\nwhereas significant improvements that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful\nlives of the related assets. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the\naccounts and any gain or loss on the sale or retirement is recognized in income.\nLessee Right-of-Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an asset underlying an operating\nlease for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from an operating lease. ROU assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally estimates the\napplicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the lease commencement date. Many of the\nCompany’s lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which the Company does not include in its lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to\nbe exercised. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and liabilities associated with certain equipment leases.\nThe Company has also made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases and to exclude short-term\nleases with a term of twelve months or less from its ROU assets and lease liabilities. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of patents, trademarks, software development costs, customer relationships and acquired technology. Costs related to patents\nand trademarks, which include legal and application fees, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Patent\nand trademark amortization commences once final approval of the patent or trademark has been obtained. Patent costs are amortized over the lesser of 10 years\nor the patent’s remaining legal life, which assumes renewals, and trademark costs are amortized over 17 years, and their associated amortization cost is\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For intangibles purchased in an\nasset acquisition or business combination, which mainly include patents, trademarks, customer relationships and acquired technologies, the useful life is\ndetermined largely by valuation estimates of remaining economic life.\nThe Company’s policy is to renew its patents and trademarks. Costs to renew patents and trademarks are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful\nlife of the intangible asset. The Company periodically evaluates the amortization period and carrying basis of patents and trademarks to determine whether any\nevents or circumstances warrant a revised estimated useful life or reduction in value. Capitalized application costs are charged to operations when it is\ndetermined that the patent or trademark will not be obtained or is abandoned.\n13\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. Once\ntechnological feasibility has been established, qualifying costs incurred in development are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and\nsubsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value.\nIntangibles purchased as part of an asset acquisition or business combination historically have included patents, trademarks, customer relationships, developed\ntechnologies and contractual licenses. In certain circumstances the Company has also acquired non-compete agreements tied to certain employment\nrelationships. The useful life for all of these is largely determined by valuation estimates of remaining economic life. In connection with the Sound United\nacquisition, the Company acquired certain trademarks/tradenames, which are intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. These brands are expected to\nmaintain brand value for an indefinite period of time.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and\nintangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that goodwill might be impaired. In assessing goodwill impairment, the Company has the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine\nwhether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount. The Company has two reporting units, healthcare and non-healthcare. The Company’s qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill\nconsiders various macro-economic, industry-specific and Company-specific factors, including: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant\nCompany-specific actions; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of the Company’s financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in the\nCompany’s market capitalization below its net book value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, then the Company performs a quantitative analysis that compares\nthe fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is\nnot considered impaired; otherwise, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the lesser of: (a) the amount that the carrying amount of such reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value; or (b) the amount of the goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal\nquarter.\nSimilar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment testing, unless circumstances dictate more\nfrequent testing, if impairment indicators exist. Impairment for indefinite-lived assets exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets if necessary for\nimpairment testing require significant judgment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial\nperformance, and other relevant events and factors.\nThe Company reviews finite lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset to the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\nrecognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the\nlower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nEmployee Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit plans that cover certain employees in certain international locations. The Company recognizes the\nfunded status, or the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of\nplan assets, the difference or underfunded status represents the pension liability. The Company records a net periodic pension cost in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations. The liabilities and annual income or expense are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial\nassumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. The Company’s accounting policy includes an\nannual re-measurement of pension assets and obligations. In addition, the Company re-measures pension assets and obligations for significant events, as of the\nnearest month-end date on the calendar. The fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices. See Note 21, “Employee Benefits”, for\nfurther details.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nfuture tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized\nin the first reporting period that it becomes more-likely-than-not such tax position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets this more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period.\nDifferences between actual results and the Company’s assumptions, or changes in the Company’s assumptions in future periods, are recorded in the period they\nbecome known. The Company records potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. The application of tax laws and regulations\nis subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes\nin legislation, evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from the\nCompany’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the\nenactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that all or\npart of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence,\nincluding recent financial performance, scheduled reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, availability of taxable income in\ncarryback periods and tax planning strategies.\nIncome taxes are highly susceptible to changes from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about the Company’s future income over the\nlives of its deferred tax assets and the impact of changes in valuation allowances. Any difference in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould result in changes to the Company’s results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Other Contract Liabilities\nThe Company generally recognizes revenue following a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers and generally\nprovides for the recognition of revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, net of allowances for\nestimated returns, discounts or sales incentives, as well as taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities, when control over the\npromised goods or services are transferred to the customer.\nHealthcare segment\nWhile the majority of the Company’s healthcare segment revenue contracts and transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some\ntransactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. As a result, contract interpretation, judgment and analysis are required to determine the\nappropriate accounting, including: (i) the amount of the total consideration, as well as variable consideration, (ii) whether the arrangement contains an\nembedded lease, and if so, whether such embedded lease is a sales-type lease or an operating lease, (iii) the identification of the distinct performance\nobligations contained within the arrangement, (iv) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each performance obligation when multiple\nperformance obligations exist, including the determination of standalone selling price, and (v) when to recognize revenue on the performance obligations.\nChanges in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from fixed lease payments\nrelated to equipment supplied under sales-type lease arrangements is recognized once control over the equipment is transferred to the customer, while revenue\nfrom fixed lease payments related to equipment supplied under operating-type lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the lease and variable lease payments are recognized as they occur.\n15\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company derives the majority of its healthcare segment revenue from four primary sources: (i) direct sales under deferred equipment agreements with end-\nuser hospitals where the Company provides up-front monitoring equipment at no up-front charge in exchange for a multi-year sensor purchase commitment;\n(ii) other direct sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other direct customers;\n(iii) sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to distributors who then typically resell to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and\nother customers; and (iv) sales of integrated circuit boards to OEM customers who incorporate the Company’s embedded software technology into their\nmultiparameter monitoring devices. Subject to customer credit considerations, the majority of such sales are made on open accounts using industry standard\npayment terms based on the geography within which the specific customer is located.\nThe Company enters into agreements to sell its monitoring solutions and services, sometimes as a part of arrangements with multiple performance obligations\nthat include various combinations of product sales, equipment leases, software and services. In the case of contracts with multiple performance obligations, the\nauthoritative guidance provides that the total consideration be allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling prices. When\na standalone selling price is not readily observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering multiple factors including, but not\nlimited to, features and functionality of the product, geographies, type of customer, contractual prices pursuant to Group Purchasing Organization (GPO)\ncontracts, the Company’s pricing and discount practices, and other market conditions.\nSales under deferred equipment agreements are generally structured such that the Company agrees to provide certain monitoring-related equipment, software,\ninstallation, training and/or warranty support at no up-front charge in exchange for the customer’s commitment to purchase sensors over the term of the\nagreement, which generally ranges from three years to six years. The Company allocates contract consideration under deferred equipment agreements\ncontaining fixed annual sensor purchase commitments to the underlying lease and non-lease components at contract inception. In determining whether any\nunderlying lease components are related to a sales-type lease or an operating lease, the Company evaluates the customer’s rights and ability to control the use\nof the underlying equipment throughout the contract term, including any equipment substitution rights retained by the Company, as well as the Company’s\nexpectations surrounding potential contract/lease extensions or renewals and the customer’s likelihood to exercise any purchase options.\nBeginning in 2022, for contracts that contain variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate, the Company classifies as operating leases any\nlease components that would have otherwise been classified as sales-type leases that would result in a selling loss upon lease commencement. Revenue\nallocable to non-lease performance obligations is generally recognized as such non-lease performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue allocable to lease\ncomponents under sales-type lease arrangements is generally recognized when control over the equipment is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue allocable to lease components under operating lease arrangements is generally recognized over the term of the operating lease. The Company\ngenerally does not expect to derive any significant value in excess of such asset’s unamortized book value from equipment underlying its operating lease\narrangements after the end of the agreement.\nRevenue from the sale of products and software to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations, other direct customers, distributors and OEM\ncustomers, is recognized by the Company when control of the performance obligations thereunder transfers to the customer based upon the terms of the\ncontract or underlying purchase order.\nRevenue related to OEM rainbow® parameter software licenses is recognized by the Company upon the OEM’s shipment of its product to its customer, as\nreported to the Company by the OEM.\nThe Company provides certain customers with various sales incentives that may take the form of discounts or rebates. The Company records estimates related\nto these programs as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. In general, customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund. However, the Company\nallows returns under certain circumstances. At the end of each period, the Company estimates and accrues for these returns as a reduction to revenue. The\nCompany estimates the revenue constraints related to these forms of variable consideration based on various factors, including expected purchasing volumes,\nprior sales and returns history, and specific contractual terms and limitations.\nNon-healthcare segment\nNon-healthcare segment revenue is related to hardware and embedded software that is integrated into final products that are manufactured and sold by the\nCompany. Products and related software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and all intended functionality is available to the customer upon\npurchase. Non-healthcare segment revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or service to customers, which is either upon shipment\nor upon delivery to the customers, depending on delivery terms.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company offers sales incentives and has customer programs consisting primarily of discounts and market development fund programs, and records them\nas contra revenue. Estimates for sales incentives are developed using the most likely amount and are included in the transaction price to the extent that a\nsignificant reversal of revenue would not result once the uncertainty is resolved. In developing these estimates, the Company also considers the susceptibility of\nthe incentive to outside influences, the length of time until the uncertainty is resolved and the Company’s experience with similar contracts. Reductions in\nrevenue related to discounts are allocated to products on a relative basis based on their respective standard selling price if there are undelivered products in a\ncontract. Judgement is required to determine the timing and amount of recognition of marketing funds which the Company estimates based on past practice of\nproviding similar funds.\nPayment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s distribution channels although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60\ndays of product shipment. Sales made directly to customers from the Company’s website are paid at the time of product shipment. Prior to determining\npayment terms for each customer, an evaluation of such customer’s credit risk is performed. Contractual allowances are an offset to accounts receivable.\nThe Company recognizes non-healthcare royalty revenue associated with certain prepaid license arrangements. The Company recognizes non-healthcare\nrevenue from the prepaid license arrangements based upon sales-based royalties when a subsequent sale occurs.\nShipping and Handling Costs and Fees\nAll shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. Charges for shipping and handling billed to customers are included as a component of revenue.\nTaxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nThe Company’s policy is to present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nDeferred Costs and Other Contract Assets\nThe costs of monitoring-related equipment provided to customers under operating lease arrangements within the Company’s deferred equipment agreements\nare generally deferred and amortized to cost of goods sold over the life of the underlying contracts. Some of the Company’s deferred equipment agreements\nalso contain provisions for certain allowances to be made directly to the end-user hospital customer at the inception of the arrangement. These allowances are\ngenerally allocated to the lease and non-lease components and recognized as a reduction to revenue as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company generally invoices its customers under deferred equipment agreements as sensors are provided to the customer. However, the Company may\nrecognize revenue for certain non-lease performance obligations under deferred equipment agreements with fixed annual commitments at the time such\nperformance obligations are satisfied and prior to the customer being invoiced. When this occurs, the Company records an unbilled contract receivable related\nto such revenue until the customer has been invoiced pursuant to the terms of the underlying deferred equipment agreement.\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized and deferred if the Company expects such costs to be recoverable over the life of\nthe contract and the contract term is greater than one year. Such deferred costs generally relate to certain incentive sales commissions earned by the Company’s\ninternal sales team in connection with the execution of deferred equipment agreements and are amortized to expense over the expected term of the underlying\ncontract.\nWarranty\nThe Company generally provides a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period ranging from six months to forty-eight months,\ndepending on the product type. In traditional sales activities, including direct and OEM sales, the Company establishes an accrued liability for the estimated\nwarranty costs at the time of revenue recognition, with a corresponding provision to cost of goods sold. Customers may also purchase extended warranty\ncoverage or service level upgrades separately or as part of a deferred equipment agreement. Revenue related to extended warranty coverage and service level\nupgrades is generally recognized over the life of the contract, which reasonably approximates the period over which such services will be provided. The related\nextended warranty and service level upgrade costs are expensed as incurred.\n17\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nChanges in the product warranty accrual were as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nProduct warranty accrual, beginning of period $ 8.6 $ 10.6\nAccrual for warranties issued 6.9 7.4\nChanges in pre-existing warranties (including changes in estimates) 2.3 (8.3)\nSettlements made (8.7) (1.0)\nProduct warranty accrual, end of period $ 9.1 $ 8.7\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs include certain advertising, marketing and endorsement agreement fees. Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nEndorsement fees associated with product endorsers are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Advertising costs are included in\nselling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prepayments made under endorsement\nagreements are included in other current assets or other non-current assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain endorsement\nagreements provide for royalty payments to endorsers based on sales of particular products, which the Company records in selling, general and administrative\nexpense as the related sales occur. Advertising costs for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $16.7 million and\n$15.7 million, respectively. Advertising costs for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $43.6 million and $44.6 million,\nrespectively.\nLitigation Costs and Contingencies\nThe Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following\nconditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date\nof the financial statements, and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of whether a loss contingency, litigation settlement or\ncontingent fee is probable or reasonably possible involves a significant amount of management judgment, as does the estimation of the range of loss given the\nnature of contingencies or any associated contingent fees related to a settlement of a legal matter. Liabilities related to litigation settlements with multiple\nelements are recorded based on the fair value of each element. Legal and other litigation related expenses are recognized as the services are provided.\nContingent legal fee expenses are recognized when probable and reasonably estimable. The Company records insurance and other indemnity recoveries for\nlitigation expenses when both of the following conditions are met: (a) the recovery is probable, and (b) collectability is reasonably assured. Insurance\nrecoveries are only recorded to the extent the litigation costs to which they relate have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s international headquarters is in Switzerland, and its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company has many other foreign subsidiaries,\nand the largest transactions in foreign currency translations occur in the Japanese Yen, the British Pound, the Chinese Yuan and the European Euro.\nThe Company records certain revenues and expenses in foreign currencies. These revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars based on the average\nexchange rate for the reporting period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect as\nof the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of a subsidiary that are denominated in the functional\ncurrency of such subsidiary are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Company, or a subsidiary that\nare not denominated in the underlying functional currency are included as a component of non-operating loss within the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations.\n18\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nDerivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company addresses market risk from changes in interest rates risks through risk management programs, which include the use of derivative instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to a counterparty’s credit risk is generally limited to the amounts of the net obligation to the counterparty. The Company established\npolicies to enter into contracts only with major investment-grade financial institutions to mitigate such counterparty credit risk. The Company also established a\npolicy to further monitor the counterparty risks throughout the life of the instruments. None of the derivative instruments currently held by the Company were\nentered into for speculative trading purposes.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are classified as\nshort-term or long-term based on the tenor of the instrument. The Company has elected not to separate a derivative instrument into current and long-term\nportions. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net liability is classified as current in total. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net asset and\nwhose current portion is an asset is classified as non-current in total. For a derivative instrument that meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, the\nCompany marks the fair value of the derivative instrument to market periodically through other comprehensive income (loss). When the hedged items are\nrecorded to income (loss), the associated deferred gains (losses) of the derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income will be reclassified into\nearnings. Any fluctuation in the fair value of a derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting is recorded to earnings (expense) in\nthe period it occurs.\nComprehensive (Loss) Income\nComprehensive (loss) income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, changes to pension benefits, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges and\nany related tax benefits (expenses) that have been excluded from net income and reflected in stockholders’ equity.\nNet Income Per Share\nA computation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 9.8 $ 10.6 $ 44.7 $ 47.6\nBasic net income per share:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 53.4 52.8 53.2 52.8\nNet income per basic share $ 0.18 $ 0.20 $ 0.84 $ 0.90\nDiluted net income per share:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 53.4 52.8 53.2 52.8\nDiluted share equivalents: stock options, RSUs and PSUs 0.9 1.1 1.1 1.1\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 54.3 53.9 54.3 53.9\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.18 $ 0.20 $ 0.82 $ 0.88\n19\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Net income per\ndiluted share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of shares and potential shares outstanding during the period, if the effect\nof potential shares is dilutive. Potential shares include incremental shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of both restricted\nshare units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). For the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, weighted options to\npurchase 1.4 million and 1.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income per\nshare because the effect of including such shares would have been antidilutive in the applicable period. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, weighted options to purchase 1.4 million and 0.9 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the\ncomputation of diluted net income per share because the effect of including such shares would have been antidilutive in the applicable period. Certain RSUs\nwere considered contingently issuable shares as their vesting is contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Since such events had not occurred and\nwere not considered probable of occurring as of each of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 2.7 million weighted-average shares related to such\nRSUs have been excluded from the calculation of potential shares for the three and nine month periods then ended.

The new standard is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a\nreportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The amendment also requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU No. 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Upon\ntransition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified\nand disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements upon\nadoption.\n3. Related Party Transactions\nOn October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate the employment of Mr. Kiani, effective October 24,\n2024. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for further details.\nMr. Kiani, our former Chairman and CEO, is the Chairman and CEO of Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow). The Company is a party to the following\nagreements with Willow:\n• Cross-Licensing Agreement - The Company and Willow are parties to a cross-licensing agreement (Cross-Licensing Agreement), which governs each\nparty’s rights to certain intellectual property held by the two companies. The Company is subject to certain annual minimum aggregate royalty obligations\nfor use of the rainbow® licensed technology. The annual minimum royalty obligation is $5.0 million prior to a change in control (as defined in the Cross-\nLicensing Agreement) of the Company or Willow and increases to $15.0 million upon a change in control, plus up to $2.0 million for each additional\nrainbow® parameter (with no maximum ceiling for non-vital sign measurements).

As a result, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which resulted in recording a $7.0 million impairment charge\nfor indefinite-lived trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit. In conjunction with this third quarter interim impairment quantitative assessment, the\nCompany concluded that both the healthcare reporting unit’s and non-healthcare reporting unit’s respective estimated fair values exceeded their carrying\nvalues. Furthermore, recoverability tests performed for other long-lived assets with finite lives indicated no recoverability issues.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment of its\nindefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived\nintangibles within the non-healthcare reporting unit exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to perform a quantitative impairment\nassessment, which resulted in recording a $3.0 million impairment charge for indefinite-lived trademarks. For purposes of the impairment test, the fair value of\nindefinite-lived assets were determined using the same methodology as described in Note 18, “Business Combinations.” The estimates and assumptions applied\nrepresent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s assumptions in measuring fair value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment\nfor its healthcare and non-healthcare reporting units. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of\nthe healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required for the healthcare reporting unit. However, the\nCompany concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the non-healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Therefore,\nthe Company proceeded to perform a quantitative assessment for its non-healthcare reporting unit.\nWhen a quantitative assessment is required for the impairment test for goodwill, the Company uses a combination of both an income and a market approach to\ndetermine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market\napproach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach to calculate projected future discounted cash\nflows included revenue growth rates, operating margins and a discount rate for the reporting unit. Discount rates were determined using a weighted average\ncost of capital for risk factors specific to the reporting unit and other market and industry data. The assumptions used are inherently subject to uncertainty and\nthe Company noted that slight changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value.\nThe estimates and assumptions applied represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s\nassumptions in measuring fair value.\n10.

Lessee ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company leases certain facilities in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions under operating lease agreements expiring\nat various dates through January 2032. In addition, the Company leases equipment in the U.S. and Europe pursuant to leases that are classified as operating\nleases and expire at various dates through November 2028. The majority of these leases are non-cancellable and generally do not contain any material\nrestrictive covenants, material residual value guarantees, or other material guarantees. The Company recognizes lease costs under these agreements using a\nstraight-line method based on total lease payments. Certain facility leases contain predetermined price escalations and in some cases renewal options, the\nlongest of which is for five years.\nThe Company generally estimates the applicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the\nlease commencement date. As of September 28, 2024, the weighted-average discount rate used by the Company for all operating leases was approximately\n4.6%.\nThe balance sheet classifications for amounts related to the Company’s operating leases for which it is the lessee are as follows:\nSeptember 28, December 30,\n(in millions) Balance sheet classification 2024 2023\nLessee ROU assets Other non-current assets $ 83.1 $ 59.1\nLessee current lease liabilities Other current liabilities 22.5 18.2\nLessee non-current lease liabilities Other non-current liabilities 65.8 45.8\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 88.3 $ 64.0\nAs of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, accumulated amortization for lessee ROU assets was $55.5 million and $48.9 million, respectively.

Generally, both healthcare and non-healthcare segments record deferred revenue when revenue is to be recognized\nsubsequent to invoicing.\nHealthcare Deferred Revenue\nHealthcare deferred revenue primarily relates to undelivered equipment, sensors and services under deferred equipment agreements, extended warranty\nagreements, and maintenance agreements. Expected revenue from remaining contractual performance obligations (Unrecognized Contract Revenue) includes\ndeferred revenue, as well as other amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods when the Company completes its performance\nobligations. Unrecognized Contract Revenue excludes revenue allocable to monitoring-related equipment that is effectively leased to customers under deferred\nequipment agreements and other contractual obligations for which neither party has performed. The estimated timing of this revenue is based, in part, on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions about when its performance obligations will be completed. As a result, the actual timing of this revenue in future\nperiods may vary, possibly materially. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $1,651.9 million of Unrecognized Contract Revenue related\nto executed contracts with an original duration of one year or more.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Instruments - Cash Flow Hedges\nThe Company’s cash flow hedges are designed to mitigate the risk of exposure to variability in expected future cash flows of recognized assets, liabilities or\nany unrecognized forecasted transactions. Since July 2022, the Company has entered into various interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges on\na substantial portion of the Company’s outstanding debt. The interest rate swaps reduce the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting\nthe variable interest rate on the Company’s long-term debt to an average fixed interest rate of 3.28%. These contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of\napproximately three years. All hedging relationships were highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged.\nThe Company used a regression analysis at hedge inception to assess the effectiveness of cash flow hedge and periodically thereafter.\nThe Company records gains and losses from the changes in the fair value of these instruments as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred\ngains or losses from these designated cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged items affect earnings. The Company does not\noffset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments in its condensed consolidated balance sheets for presentation purposes. The following table\nsummarizes the fair value of the hedging instruments, presented on a gross basis, as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\nCondensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets\nSeptember 28, December 30,\n(in millions) Balance sheet classification 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts, inclusive of accrued interest Other non-current assets $ 4.7 $ 11.6\nInterest rate contracts, inclusive of accrued interest Other non-current liabilities (4.9) (3.6)\nTotal $ (0.2) $ 8.0\nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for the three months and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nCondensed Consolidated\nCash flow hedges Statement of Operations\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in millions) Location of gain 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts Non-operating gain $ 3.8 $ 4.1 $ 12.2 $ 10.9\nTotal $ 3.8 $ 4.1 $ 12.2 $ 10.9\nThe following tables summarize the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the hedging instruments for the three months and\nnine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 13.5 $ 21.1 $ 7.8 $ 19.3\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income (11.1) 4.5 3.0 13.1\nAmount reclassified into earnings (3.8) (4.1) (12.2) (10.9)\nEnding balance $ (1.4) $ 21.5 $ (1.4) $ 21.5\n34\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nFor the three months ended September 28, 2024, the unrealized loss, net of tax was $11.3 million.

Business Combinations\nSound United Acquisition\nOn April 11, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Sound United. Sound United is a leading innovator of premium, high-performance audio\nproducts for consumers around the world, which operates iconic consumer brands: Bowers & Wilkins®, Denon™, Marantz™, HEOS™, Classé™, Polk Audio™,\nBoston Acoustics™ and Definitive Technology™. The brands are linked by a commitment to the highest production standards and a focus on unparalleled audio\nquality and audio performance. Sound United delivers significant competitive benefits through its platform advantages including global distribution across\nonline, retail, and custom installation channels; a cloud-connected home ecosystem; and a state-of-the-art research and development function focused on\ncreating the highest-quality consumer products with world-class industrial design.\nThe Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sound United for $1.0575 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on Sound United’s net working\ncapital, transaction expenses, cash and debt as of the closing of the acquisition, payable by the Company in cash. The transaction was primarily funded with the\nproceeds from the Credit Facility. See Note 15, “Debt”, for additional information about the Credit Facility. There was no contingent consideration resulting\nfrom the transaction.\nThe results of operations of Sound United subsequent to the acquisition date and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including the allocation of\ngoodwill and intangible assets, are included in the non-healthcare segment. For the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded revenue of $161.4 million and $171.5 million, respectively, and a net loss of $12.9 million and $17.8 million from Sound United,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of $465.6 million and $562.1 million,\nrespectively, and a net loss of $31.3 million and $21.2 million from Sound United, respectively.\nAcquisition Costs\nThe Company recognized no transaction costs related to the Sound United acquisition for each of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nPurchase Price Allocations\nThe purchase price allocation for the Sound United acquisition is final. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from intangible assets\nacquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe measurement period adjustments resulted primarily from valuation inputs pertaining to certain acquired assets based on facts and circumstances that\nexisted as of the acquisition date and did not result from events subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe table below summarizes the final allocation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n35\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n(in millions) Sound United\nCash consideration $ 1,057.5\nPurchase price $ 1,057.5\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 82.6\nAccounts receivables 108.5\nInventories 238.6\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 30.0\nProperty, plant and equipment 113.2\nIntangible assets 649.0\nGoodwill 318.0\nLong-term other assets 7.4\nTotal assets acquired $ 1,547.3\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable $ (118.8)\nAccrued liabilities and other current liabilities (148.9)\nDeferred tax liabilities (145.1)\nOther long-term liabilities (77.0)\nTotal liabilities assumed $ (489.8)\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the weighted average amortization period as of the acquisition date:\nWeighted average April 11,\namortization period 2022\n(in years) (in millions)\nTrademarks/tradenames 10 $ 6.0\nCustomer relationships 17 196.0\nDeveloped technology 8 156.0\nContractual license agreements 15 29.0\nSubtotal 14 years $ 387.0\nIndefinite trademarks/tradenames N/A 262.0\nTotal $ 649.0\nIn determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being\nvalued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow\nstream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Other inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth\nrates. Contractual license agreements have a weighted-average amortization period of five years until the next renewal term.\nThe intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:\nCustomer relationships\nThe fair value of customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method involves\nforecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets, and then discounting the\nresulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\n36\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nTrademarks/tradenames\nThe fair values of the trademark/tradenames were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting\navoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was\napplied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life,\nroyalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\nDeveloped technology\nThe fair values of the developed technology were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting\navoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was\napplied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life,\nroyalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\nContractual licensing agreements\nThe fair value of the contractual license agreements was determined using a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method. This method involves\nforecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset and then discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate\ndiscount rate.\n19. Equity\nSeries A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Stockholder Rights Plan\nIn September 2022, the Company authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of its common\nstock to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 20, 2022 (the Record Date) pursuant to a Rights Agreement, dated as of September 9,\n2022 (Rights Agreement), with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. as Rights Agent.

Each Right entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one thousandth of one share of\nthe Company’s Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price equal to $1,000.00 per Right, subject to adjustment.\nGenerally, the Rights were to become exercisable in the event any person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 10%\n(20% in the case of a passive institutional investor), subject to certain exceptions.\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company and the Rights Agent entered into an amendment (Rights Agreement Amendment) to the Rights Agreement. The Rights\nAgreement Amendment accelerated the expiration of the Rights to 5:00 P.M., New York time, on March 22, 2023, and the Rights Agreement terminated at such\ntime. At the time of the termination of the Rights Agreement, all Rights distributed to holders of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Rights\nAgreement expired.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn June 2022, the Board approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of its common stock on or before\nDecember 31, 2027 (2022 Repurchase Program).

As of September 28, 2024,\nthe Company had $88.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSU awards expected to be recognized and vest over a weighted-\naverage period of approximately 3.2 years.\nAs previously mentioned in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under the heading “Net Income Per Share”, 2.7 million shares related to\ncertain RSUs were considered contingently issuable shares as their vesting is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. As of September 28, 2024, such\nevents were deemed to have not occurred. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details.\nPSUs\nThe number of PSUs outstanding under all of the Company’s equity plans are as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024\nWeighted-Average Grant\n(in millions, except for weighted-average grant date fair value amounts) Units Date Fair Value\nPSUs outstanding, beginning of period 0.3 $ 190.04\nGranted(1) 0.2 164.19\nExpired (0.1) 228.22\nVested — 250.73\nPSUs outstanding, end of period 0.4 $ 171.59\n______________\n(1) On February 28, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the weighted payout percentage of 28% for the 2021 PSU awards (three-year performance period), which were based upon the actual fiscal\n2023 performance against pre-established performance objectives. Included in the granted amount are those additional PSUs earned based on actual performance achieved. These PSUs were\noriginally awarded at target.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company awarded 155,156 PSUs that will vest three years from the award date, based on the\nachievement of certain pre-established multi-year performance criteria approved by the Board. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award\nwith performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions and the cumulative effect of any changes in the probability\noutcomes is recorded in the period in which the changes occur. If earned, the PSUs granted will vest upon achievement of the performance criteria, which\ninclude a relative total shareholder return (TSR) component, in the year following the evaluation and confirmation of the performance achievement criteria.\nThe Company’s TSR is based on the Company’s common stock percentile ranking relative to the constituents of the Nasdaq Composite Index for the\nperformance period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2026. The number of shares that may be earned can range from 0% to 200% of\nthe target amount. The fair value of market-based RSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine\nthe probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The fair value of performance-based PSUs is determined using the closing price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the grant date. Based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest, total PSU (benefit) for the three months\nended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $(1.6) million and $(8.3) million, respectively. Total PSU expense (benefit) for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $2.0 million and $(23.6) million, respectively. The PSU expense amounts for the three months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 relate to adjustments for the expected life-to-date performance of the PSU. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $14.9 million of\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards expected to be recognized and vest over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4\nyears.\nValuation of Stock-Based Award Activity\nThe fair value of each RSU and PSU is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. The range\nof assumptions used and the resulting weighted-average fair value of options granted at the date of grant were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024(1) 2023(1) 2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate —% —% 4.2% 4.2%\nExpected term (in years) — — 5.9 5.9\nEstimated volatility —% —% 42.6% 36.7%\nExpected dividends —% —% —% —%\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted $— $— $59.60 $75.08\n______________\n(1) No options were granted during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options is calculated as the positive difference, if any, between the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date\nof exercise or the respective period end, as appropriate, and the exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding with an\nexercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of September 28, 2024 was $52.2 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options\nexercisable with an exercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of September 28, 2024 was $51.9 million.\n40\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n21. Employee Benefits\nDefined Contribution Plans\nIn the U.S. the Company sponsors one qualified defined contribution plan or 401(k) plan, the Masimo Retirement Savings Plan (MRSP), covering the\nCompany’s full-time U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. On April 11, 2022, in connection with the Sound United acquisition, the MRSP\nwas amended to allow for participation by eligible Sound United employees.\nThe MRSP matches 100% of a participant’s salary deferral, up to 3% of each participant’s compensation for the pay period, subject to a maximum amount. The\nCompany may also contribute to the MRSP on a discretionary basis. The Company contributed $1.1 million to the MRSP for each of the three months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, all in the form of matching contributions. The Company contributed $3.6 million and $3.8 million to the MRSP\nfor the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all in the form of matching contributions.\nIn addition, some of the Company’s international subsidiaries also have defined contribution plans to which both the employee and employers are eligible to\nmake contributions. The Company contributed $1.5 million and $1.3 million to these plans for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023, respectively. The Company contributed $4.4 million and $4.1 million to these plans for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors several international noncontributory defined benefit plans. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, the Company assumed\nsponsorship of several international defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans. All defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans assumed\nby the Company were closed to new participants prior to the Sound United acquisition.\nThe service cost component for the defined benefit plans are recorded in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other\ncost components are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company’s net periodic defined benefit costs for each of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023 were immaterial.\n22. Non-operating Loss\nNon-operating loss consists of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRealized and unrealized foreign currency (losses) gains $ (9.3) $ 0.9 $ (6.1) $ 6.8\nInterest income 1.3 0.7 3.7 2.2\nInterest expense (10.5) (12.8) (33.6) (36.5)\nTotal non-operating loss $ (18.5) $ (11.2) $ (36.0) $ (27.5)\n41\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n23. Income Taxes\nThe Company has provided for income taxes in fiscal year 2024 interim periods based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year, as\nadjusted for discrete tax events, including excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, in the period such events occur. The\nestimated annual effective tax rate is computed based on the expected annual pretax income of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction\nbased on legislation enacted as of the balance sheet date. For the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded\ndiscrete tax benefits of approximately $1.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation. For\nthe nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $4.9 million and $3.1\nmillion, respectively, related to excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses\nreported for accounting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent that the Company cannot determine that the\nultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not. Realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of\nfuture taxable income, the estimation of which requires significant judgment by the Company’s management. The judgment of the Company’s management\nregarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the Company’s ability to successfully execute its\nbusiness plans or tax planning strategies. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was approximately $39.3 million. If fully recognized,\napproximately $36.6 million (net of federal benefit on state taxes) would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of\nunrecognized tax benefits in various jurisdictions may change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements.\nHowever, due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of these events, an estimate of the change within the next twelve months cannot currently be made.\nThe Company conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and, as a result, one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal,\nvarious state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2019. All material state, local\nand foreign income tax matters have been concluded through fiscal year 2016. The Company does not believe that the results of any tax authority examination\nwould have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n24. Commitments and Contingencies\nEmployment and Severance Agreements\nOn October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate the employment of Mr. Joe Kiani, the Company’s\nformer Chairman and CEO, effective October 24, 2024.\nThe Company and Mr. Kiani entered into an employment agreement on November 4, 2015 (as thereafter amended and waived, the Amended Employment\nAgreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Employment Agreement, upon a “Qualifying Termination” (as defined in the Amended Employment\nAgreement), Mr. Kiani would be entitled to receive (i) a cash severance benefit equal to two times the sum of his then-current base salary and the average\nannual bonus paid to Mr. Kiani during the immediately preceding three years, (ii) immediate vesting of Mr. Kiani’s stock options and equity awards, (iii)\n2.7 million restricted share units (RSUs), and (iv) a cash payment of $35 million (the Cash Payment and, together with the RSUs, the Special Payment). As set\nforth in the Amended Employment Agreement, a Qualifying Termination includes a termination by Mr. Kiani for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Amended\nEmployment Agreement), which includes, among other things, (i) any diminution of Mr. Kiani’s responsibilities, duties and authority as set forth in Section 2\nof the Amended Employment Agreement, (ii) Mr. Kiani ceasing to serve as the Company’s CEO and Chairman (the Chairman Provision), and (iii) a “Change-\nin-Control” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement).\n42\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nIn the event of a “Change-in-Control” prior to a Qualifying Termination, on each of the first and second anniversaries of the Change-in-Control, 50% of the\nCash Payment and 50% of the RSUs will vest, subject in each case to Mr. Kiani’s continuous employment through each such anniversary date; however, in the\nevent of a Qualifying Termination or a termination of Mr. Kiani’s employment due to death or disability prior to either of such anniversaries, any unvested\namount of the Cash Payment and all of the unvested RSUs shall vest and be paid in full. Additionally, in the event of a Change-in-Control prior to a Qualifying\nTermination, Mr. Kiani’s stock options and any other equity awards would vest in accordance with their terms, but in no event later than in two equal\ninstallments on each of the one year and two year anniversaries of the Change-in- Control, subject in each case to Mr. Kiani’s continuous employment through\neach such anniversary date.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Amended Employment Agreement (Second Amendment) with Mr. Kiani. The\nSecond Amendment provides that the RSUs granted to Mr. Kiani pursuant to the Amended Employment Agreement will vest in full upon the termination of Mr.\nKiani’s employment with the Company pursuant to Mr. Kiani’s death or disability.\nOn February 8, 2023, Mr. Kiani agreed that the valid election to the Company’s Board at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders of any two\nindividuals nominated by the Company’s stockholders in lieu of two of the Company’s then-current Board members would not be deemed to constitute a\nChange in Control for purposes of Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement.\nOn March 22, 2023, in connection with the Board’s unanimous selection of H Michael Cohen as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Kiani voluntarily irrevocably\nand permanently waived his right to treat the appointment of any lead independent director as “Good Reason” to terminate his employment under the Amended\nEmployment Agreement, and his right to receive contractual separation payments on this basis.\nOn June 5, 2023, Mr. Kiani, pursuant to a Limited Waiver (Waiver), unconditionally, irrevocably and permanently waived his right, pursuant to the Amended\nEmployment Agreement, to assert that a “Change in Control” has occurred pursuant to Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement unless the\nindividuals who constituted the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding such change, as defined in Section 9(iii) of the\nAmended Employment Agreement, cease for any reason to constitute one-half or more of the directors then in office. In addition, Mr. Kiani agreed that, for\npurposes of determining whether such a “Change in Control” has occurred, any individual elected to the Board at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of\nstockholders will be treated as a member of the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.\nAs a result of Mr. Kiani’s execution of the Waiver on June 5, 2023, which waived certain of the “Change in Control” provisions in the Amended Employment\nAgreement, the Company remeasured the expense related to the Award Shares and Cash Payment that would be recognized in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination under the Amended Employment Agreement, as amended by the Second\nAmendment, and the expense was determined to be approximately $479.7 million.\nOn September 19, 2024, at the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company’s stockholders voted to not reelect Mr. Kiani to the Board.\nAdditionally, on September 19, 2024, after the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the Board stating his\ndecision to resign from his position of CEO of the Company and filed a claim in California Superior Court relating to his Amended Employment Agreement,\nseeking, among other things, declaratory relief that he had validly terminated his employment for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Amended Employment\nAgreement), and that he was entitled to certain benefits provided in the Amended Employment Agreement upon a termination for “Good Reason”.\nOn October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate the employment of Mr. Kiani, effective October 24,\n2024. The termination was not a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement). Consequently, the Company believes Mr. Kiani\nis not entitled to receive the Special Payment under the Amended Employment Agreement.\nAlso on October 24, 2024, the Company filed claims against Mr. Kiani in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Chancery Court Litigation),\nseeking judicial declarations that numerous provisions in Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement, including the Special Payment, are invalid,\nunenforceable, and amount to a waste of corporate assets and, therefore, that Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment. The Company’s\ncomplaint alleges that the Company’s directors at the time of the initial adoption of Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement and at the adoption of\nsubsequent\n43\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\namendments abdicated their fiduciary duties as a matter of Delaware law by approving the Amended Employment Agreement, which contained provisions\nintended to entrench Mr. Kiani’s control of the Company indefinitely.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had severance plan participation agreements with six executive officers. The participation agreements (the\nAgreements) are governed by the terms and conditions of the Company’s 2007 Severance Protection Plan (the Severance Plan), which became effective on\nJuly 19, 2007 and which was amended effective December 31, 2008.\nUnder each of the Agreements, the applicable executive officer may be entitled to receive certain salary, equity, medical and life insurance benefits if he is\nterminated by the Company without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason under certain circumstances. Each executive officer is also\nrequired to give the Company six months’ advance notice of his resignation under certain circumstances.\nWillow Cross-Licensing Agreement Provisions\nThe Company’s Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow contains annual minimum aggregate royalty obligations for the Company’s use of the rainbow®\nlicensed technology, which is a perpetual global license. Prior to a change in control, which is defined in the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement to include,\namong other things, Mr. Kiani ceasing to serve as CEO of either the Company or Willow, the Company’s annual minimum royalty obligation is $5.0 million.\nUpon a change in control of the Company or Willow: (i) all rights to the “Masimo” trademark will be assigned to Willow if the surviving or acquiring entity\nceases to use “Masimo” as a company name and trademark; (ii) the option to license technology developed by Willow for use in blood glucose monitoring will\nbe deemed automatically exercised and a $2.5 million license fee for this technology will become immediately payable to Willow; and (iii) the minimum\naggregate annual royalties payable to Willow for carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin and/or glucose\nmeasurements will increase to $15.0 million per year until the exclusivity period of the agreement ends, plus up to $2.0 million for each additional rainbow®\nparameter (with no maximum ceiling for non-vital sign measurements). Any payment due annually to Willow resulting from a change in control of the\nCompany is less than what the Company paid to Willow for licensing rights in 2022 or 2023. As of September 28, 2024, a change in control for purposes of the\nWillow Cross-Licensing Agreement had not occurred, and as such no accrual was made.\nOn October 24, 2024, a change in control as defined in the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement occurred when Mr. Kiani’s employment as the Company’s CEO\nwas terminated, resulting in a payment of $2.5 million for the licensing of Willow blood glucose monitoring technology, which was recorded to intangible\nassets on the Company’s balance sheet. A change in control does not otherwise impact the scope or duration of the license rights. No additional accruals or\npayments were made in connection with the change in control under the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement.\nPurchase Commitments\nPursuant to contractual obligations with vendors, the Company had $274.0 million of purchase commitments as of September 28, 2024 that are expected to be\npurchased within one year. These purchase commitments have been made for certain inventory items in order to secure sufficient levels of those items, other\ncritical inventory and manufacturing supplies, and to achieve better pricing.\nIn addition, the Company has certain purchase commitments related to its purchase of a property in Vancouver, British Columbia. See Note 8, “Property and\nEquipment, net”, for further details.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may provide bank guarantees to support government hospital tenders in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.9 million in outstanding unsecured bank guarantees.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company also provides limited indemnification within its various customer contracts whereby the Company indemnifies the\nparties to whom it sells its products with respect to potential infringement of intellectual property, and against bodily injury caused by a defective Company\nproduct. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the\nCompany’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had not incurred any significant costs related\nto contractual indemnification of its customers.\n44\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nFee Agreements\nOn January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a one year alternative fee agreement (Fee Agreement) with respect to certain on-going legal fees and costs\ncharged by a vendor. The Fee Agreement imposes certain limits on a quarterly and annual basis for actual legal fees incurred by the vendor that are payable\nbased on work performed related to litigation matters against Apple (see the heading “Litigation” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” for further\ndetails). If the vendor is successful in obtaining a favorable judgement for the Company on any claim or counterclaim after exhaustion or dismissal of any\nappeals, or upon settlement resulting in monetary consideration to the Company, the vendor will be paid a success fee equal to three times the amount of the\nexcess of the annual legal fee limit within 60 days after entry of a judgement or the effective date of any settlement. Amounts due to the vendor under this Fee\nAgreement will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn connection with the potential separation of the Company’s consumer businesses, the Company entered into contingent or discretionary fee agreements with\nvarious service providers, advisors and consultants. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the contingent fees due under these agreements at this time.\nAmounts due will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.\nEndorsement Agreements\nThe Company entered into two endorsement agreements, effective on February 1, 2024 and April 12, 2024, respectively, with terms ranging from 18 months to\n36 months, for an approximate total commitment of $11.5 million, plus applicable taxes. One of these agreements also contains certain royalty payment\nprovisions based on sales of particular products, with a minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $0.5 million. As of September 28, 2024, the outstanding\namount of the obligations under these endorsement agreements was an aggregate of $7.8 million.\nConcentrations of Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss for the amount of its cash deposits with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company invests\na portion of its excess cash with major financial institutions. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $158.5 million of bank balances, of which $8.3\nmillion was covered by either the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit or foreign countries’ deposit insurance organizations.\nThe Company’s ability to sell its healthcare products to U.S. hospitals depends in part on its relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential healthcare\ncustomers for the Company’s products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes exclusively, with medical\nsupply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members. During the three\nmonths ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, revenue from the sale of the Company’s healthcare products to customers that are members of\nGPOs approximated 57.3% and 50.5% of healthcare revenue, respectively. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrevenue from the sale of the Company’s healthcare products to customers that are members of GPOs approximated 57.9% and 52.9% of healthcare revenue,\nrespectively.\nFor the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had sales through one just-in-time healthcare distributor that\nrepresented 16.2% and 10.7% of consolidated revenue, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had sales through one just-in-time healthcare distributor that\nrepresented 13.9% and 10.4% of consolidated revenue, respectively.\nFor each of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no revenue concentrations for the Company’s non-\nhealthcare business.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, there were no customer concentrations risks associated with the Company’s healthcare business.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, there were no customer concentration risks associated with the Company’s non-healthcare business.\n45\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nLitigation\nOn January 9, 2020, the Company filed a complaint against Apple Inc. (Apple) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for\ninfringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation, and for ownership and correction of inventorship of a number of Apple patents listing\none of its former employees as an inventor. The Company is seeking damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment regarding ownership of the Apple\npatents. Apple filed petitions for Inter Partes review (IPR) of the asserted patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO instituted IPR of the\nasserted patents. On October 13, 2020, the District Court stayed the patent infringement claims pending completion of the IPR proceedings. In the IPR\nproceedings, one or more of the challenged claims of three of the asserted patents were found valid. The challenged claims of nine of the asserted patents were\nfound invalid. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed all the IPR decisions except it reversed a finding of invalidity for certain\ndependent claims of one Masimo patent. From April 4, 2023 through May 1, 2023, the District Court held a jury trial on the trade secret, ownership, and\ninventorship claims. The District Court granted Apple’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on certain trade secrets and denied the remainder of Apple’s\nmotion. On May 1, 2023, the District Court declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The District Court scheduled a retrial\non the trade secret, ownership, and inventorship claims to begin November 5, 2024. The stay of the patent infringement claims has been lifted and those claims\nwill be tried at a later date.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple for infringement of a number of other\npatents. The Company filed an amended complaint on July 12, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the ITC issued a Notice of Institution of Investigation on the\nasserted patents. From June 6, 2022 to June 10, 2022, the ITC conducted an evidentiary hearing. In July and August 2022, Apple filed petitions for IPR of the\nasserted patents in the PTO. On January 10, 2023, a United States Administrative Law Judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Apple violated Section 337 of the\nTariff Act of 1930 (Section 337), as amended, by importing and selling within the United States certain Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry\nfunctionality and components, which infringe one of the Company’s pulse oximeter patents. On January 24, 2023, the United States Administrative Law Judge\nfurther recommended that the ITC issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order on certain Apple Watches. On October 26, 2023, the ITC issued a\nNotice of Final Determination finding a violation of Section 337 by Apple. The ITC determined that the appropriate form of relief is a Limited Exclusion Order\n(LEO) prohibiting the unlicensed entry of infringing wearable electronic devices with light-based pulse oximetry functionality manufactured by or on behalf of\nApple, and a Cease and Desist Order (CDO). The LEO and CDO went into effect after the 60-day Presidential review period expired. The LEO and CDO are\ncurrently in effect. Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit is pending. On January 30, 2023, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings for the Company’s\npulse oximeter patents that the ITC ruled were infringed. With respect to the other patents asserted at the ITC, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings\nfor one patent and instituted IPR proceedings for two patents in January and February 2023. In the IPR proceedings, one or more of the challenged claims were\nfound valid, while others were found invalid. The time period for appeal is pending. On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Exclusion\nOrder Enforcement Branch issued a ruling letter allowing importation of certain Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature disabled.\nOn October 20, 2022, Apple filed two complaints against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Masimo W1™\nwatch infringes six utility and four design patents. Apple is seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December 12, 2022, the Company counterclaimed for\nmonopolization, attempted monopolization, false advertising (and related causes of action) and infringement of ten patents. The Company is seeking damages\nand injunctive relief. On May 5, 2023, the Court ordered that the two cases be coordinated through the pre-trial stage. The Court held a case management\nconference in March 2024. On October 7, 2024, the Court granted summary judgment on the Company’s inequitable conduct defense and counterclaim. The\nCourt held a jury trial in October 2024 on Apple’s patent claims. The jury found that the Company’s current product offerings do not infringe any Apple\npatents. The jury found a discontinued version of the Masimo W1™ watch infringed one design patent and a discontinued version of the Masimo W1™ watch\ncharger infringed a second design patent. The jury awarded a total of $250. The Company’s patent and antitrust counterclaims will be tried at a later date. The\nCompany intends to vigorously pursue all of its claims against Apple and believes the Company has good and substantial defenses to Apple’s claims, but there\nis no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\n46\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nOn August 22, 2023, a putative class action complaint was filed by Sergio Vazquez against the Company and members of its management alleging violations of\nthe federal securities laws (Securities Class Action). On November 14, 2023, the court appointed Boston Retirement System, Central Pennsylvania Teamsters\nPension Fund-Defined Benefit Plan, and Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund-Retirement Income Plan 1987 as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint on February 12, 2024. The amended complaint alleges that the Company and members of its management, from May 4, 2022 through\nAugust 8, 2023, disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts relating to the performance of its healthcare\nbusiness and the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on April 29, 2024 and\nbriefing on the motion concluded on July 26, 2024. The motion is currently pending. The Company believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claims\nin the amended complaint, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn May 1, 2024, a purported stockholder, Linda McClellan, filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against\ncertain of the Company’s current and former executives and directors, and the Company as nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that\nthe defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company by allowing or permitting false or misleading statements to be disseminated regarding the\nperformance of the Company’s healthcare business and the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The complaint also asserts causes of\naction for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.§ 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, aiding and abetting\nbreach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. On May 16, 2024, purported stockholder\nDianne Himmelberger filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (collectively, Derivative Actions). On\nJuly 22, 2024, the Court consolidated the Derivative Actions and stayed them until the motion to dismiss the Securities Class Action has been (i) denied in\nwhole or in part, and no amended complaint is subsequently filed; or (ii) granted with prejudice, and any appeals pertaining to the motion to dismiss have\nconcluded, or the time for seeking appellate review has passed with no further action from the Securities Class Action parties.\nThe Company received a subpoena from the Department of Justice (DOJ) dated February 21, 2024 seeking documents and information related to the\nCompany’s Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including information relating to complaints surrounding the products and the Company’s decision to recall select\nRad-G® products in 2024.\nThe Company received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, dated March 25, 2024, seeking\ndocuments and information related to customer returns of the Company’s Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including returns related to the Company’s recall of\nselect Rad-G® products in 2024.\nThe Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 26, 2024 seeking documents and information relating to\nallegations of potential accounting irregularities and internal control deficiencies from employees within the Company’s accounting department.\nWith respect to each of the subpoenas and the investigative demand described above, the Company is cooperating with the government and may expend\nsignificant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoenas and investigative demand and any related investigation or any\nother future requests for information. In addition, requests and investigations of this nature may lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal\nproceedings against the Company, which in turn may lead to material fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company commenced litigation against Politan, including Mr. Koffey and Ms. Brennan, members of the Board, in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Central District of California seeking, among other things, an order declaring that Politan’s proxy materials for the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of\nstockholders violate Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), an order enjoining Politan from voting any proxies\nreceived by means of Politan’s misleading proxy material, an order invalidating any proxies Politan or other persons acting in concert with it obtained pursuant\nto the misleading proxy material and an injunction requiring Politan to correct material misstatements and omissions in Politan’s proxy materials for the\nCompany’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. On July 19, 2024, the Company filed a request for expedited discovery, which the District Court granted, and\na motion for preliminary injunction. On August 26, 2024, the Company filed an amended complaint adding a claim that Politan had violated Section 13(d) of\nthe Exchange Act for its disclosures related to its investment in the Company. The District Court denied the Company’s motion for a preliminary injunction\nafter a hearing on September 9, 2024.\nOn July 17, 2024, Politan commenced litigation against the Company, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek, members of the Board, in the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware alleging that Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by moving the date of\nthe Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders from July 25,\n47\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n2024 to September 19, 2024, and seeking, among other things, to have the Company set the record date and hold the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of\nstockholders as soon as possible, without further adjournment or postponement (Politan Chancery Litigation). On July 19, 2024, the Court of Chancery denied\nPolitan’s request to reschedule the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders to an earlier date. On October 25, 2024, Politan voluntarily dismissed the\nPolitan Chancery Litigation without prejudice.\nOn September 19, 2024, at the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company’s stockholders voted not to reelect Mr. Kiani to the Board. On\nSeptember 19, 2024, after the conclusion of the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the Board stating his\ndecision to resign from his position of CEO of the Company (the September 19 Notice). On September 23, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the\nBoard further describing his decision to resign (the September 23 Notice), and, on September 25, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered an amended notification to the\nBoard stating his decision to resign (the September 25 Notice, and, together with the September 19 Notice and the September 23 Notice, the Notice).\nThe Notice further states that Mr. Kiani’s resignation is for “Good Reason” (as such term is defined in Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement) and that\nthe basis for his resignation for Good Reason is the diminution of his “responsibilities, duties and authority as the Chairman of the Board and CEO” as defined\nin Sections 2 and 7.4 of his Amended Employment Agreement.\nAdditionally, on September 19, 2024, Mr. Kiani filed a claim in California Superior Court relating to his Amended Employment Agreement seeking, among\nother things, a declaratory relief that he had validly terminated his employment for “Good Reason”, and that he was entitled to certain benefits provided in the\nAmended Employment Agreement upon a termination for Good Reason, including the Special Payment.\nThe Company is evaluating the claim, and believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claim, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be\nsuccessful in these efforts.\nAlso on October 24, 2024, the Company filed Chancery Court Litigation against Mr. Kiani, seeking judicial declarations that numerous provisions in Mr.\nKiani’s Amended Employment Agreement, including the Special Payment, are invalid, unenforceable, and amount to a waste of corporate assets and, therefore,\nthat Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment. The Company’s complaint in the Chancery Court Litigation alleges that Masimo’s directors at the\ntime of the initial adoption of the Employment Agreement and subsequent amendments abdicated their fiduciary duties as a matter of Delaware law by\napproving the Amended Employment Agreement, which contained provisions intended to entrench Mr. Kiani in control of the Company indefinitely.\nAlso, on October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment, effective October 24,\n2024. The termination was not a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement). Consequently, the Company believes Mr. Kiani\nis not entitled to receive the Special Payment under the Amended Employment Agreement.\nOn October 25, 2024, the Company commenced litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Mr. Kiani, Roderick\nWong, Naveen Yalamanchi, RTW Investments, LP, RTW Investments GP, LLC, RTW Master Fund, Ltd., RTW Offshore Fund One, Ltd., RTW Onshore Fund\nOne, LP, RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd., RTW Innovation Offshore Fund, Ltd., RTW Innovation Onshore Fund, LP, and RTW Fund Group GP, LLC,\nseeking disgorgement of short-swing profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Company alleges that the defendants formed a stockholder\ngroup under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act holding 10% or more of the Company’s common stock and engaged in short-swing trading between May and\nSeptember 2024 as a part of an empty voting scheme to manipulate the vote in Mr. Kiani’s favor for the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders.\nCollectively the group of defendants formed held as much as 19% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Company alleges that RTW secretly\nincreased its long position in the Company immediately in advance of each the two record dates used in the 2024 proxy contest to maximize its voting power in\nfavor of Mr. Kiani while offsetting its economic exposure from this increased long position by engaging in short selling. RTW then reduced its long position\nand covered its short position after each of the two record dates. Thus for each of the two record dates, RTW artificially and temporarily inflated its voting\npower to benefit Mr. Kiani. RTW carried out this empty voting scheme in coordination with Mr. Kiani. The trading RTW used in this scheme constitutes short-\nswing trading under Section 16(b) and any profits from such trading must be disgorged to the Company.\n48\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nFor each of the foregoing matters, the Company is unable to determine whether any loss ultimately will occur or to estimate the range of such loss; therefore,\nno amount of loss accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in other litigation and investigations relating to claims and matters arising out of its operations in the normal\ncourse of business. The Company believes that it currently is not a party to any other legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n25. Segment and Enterprise Reporting\nThe Company’s reportable segments are determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure and the way in which the Company’s Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (CODM), the CEO, makes operating decisions and assesses financial performance. The CODM considered several factors including, but not\nlimited to, customer base, technology, and homogeneity of products.\nThe two segments are:\n• Healthcare - develops, manufactures, and markets a variety of noninvasive monitoring technologies and hospital automation solutions and therapeutics.\nThis segment includes the Company’s core legacy hospital business and new Masimo-technology-enabled consumer products that are distributed through\nmany channels including e-commerce sites, leading national retailers and specialty chains globally.\n• Non-healthcare - designs, develops, manufactures, markets and sells a broad portfolio of premium, high-performance audio products and services.\nIncome from operations for each segment includes all geographic revenues, related cost of net revenues and operating expenses directly attributable to the\nsegment. The Company uses gross profit, as presented in the Company’s financial reports, as the primary measure of segment profitability. The Company uses\nthe same accounting policies to generate segment results as the Company does for consolidated results. Segment information presented herein reflects the\nimpact of these changes for all periods presented. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, intercompany revenues between the Healthcare\nand Non-healthcare segments were $2.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, intercompany\nrevenues between the Healthcare and Non-healthcare segments were $5.0 million. All inter-segment transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation\nfor all periods presented below.\nSelected information by reportable segment is presented below for each of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues by segment:\nHealthcare $ 343.3 $ 307.8 $ 1,026.8 $ 935.6\nNon-healthcare 161.3 171.1 466.9 563.6\nTotal revenue by segment $ 504.6 $ 478.9 $ 1,493.7 $ 1,499.2\nGross profit:\nHealthcare $ 215.9 $ 185.6 $ 642.2 $ 569.4\nNon-healthcare 55.8 55.8 154.3 192.2\nOther(1) (8.5) (6.6) (36.8) (20.8)\nGross profit $ 263.2 $ 234.8 $ 759.7 $ 740.8\n____________________________\n(1) Management excludes certain corporate expenses from segment gross profit.

We seek to accelerate our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on patient care via two\nbusiness segments: healthcare and non-healthcare.\nHealthcare\nOur healthcare business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies, hospital automation and connectivity\nsolutions, remote monitoring devices and consumer health products. Our healthcare products and patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor\nor circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable sensors, software, cables and other services. We primarily sell our healthcare products to hospitals,\nemergency medical service (EMS) providers, home care providers, physician offices, veterinarians, long-term care facilities and consumers through our direct\nsales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, such as GE Healthcare, Hillrom, Mindray, Philips, Physio-Control, and Zoll,\namong others.\nOur core measurement technologies are our breakthrough Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry, known as Masimo Signal Extraction\nTechnology® (SET®) pulse oximetry, and advanced rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry parameters such as noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb®), alongside many other\nmodalities, including brain function monitoring, hemodynamic monitoring, regional oximetry, acoustic respiration rate monitoring, capnography and gas\nmonitoring, nasal high-flow respiratory support therapy, patient position and activity tracking, neuromodulation technology, an opioid overdose prevention and\nalert solution, and telehealth solutions.\nOur measurement technologies are available on many types of devices, from bedside hospital monitors like the Root® Patient Monitoring and Connectivity\nHub, to various handheld and portable devices, and to the tetherless Radius-PPG®, Radius-VSM® and Masimo SafetyNet™ remote patient surveillance solution.\nThe Masimo Hospital Automation™ Platform facilitates data integration, connectivity, and interoperability through solutions like Patient SafetyNet™, Iris™,\niSirona™, Replica® and UniView® to facilitate more efficient clinical workflows and to help clinicians provide the best possible care, both in-person and\nremotely.

This clearance brings consumers a pulse oximeter medical device powered by\nMasimo SET® pulse oximetry, the same technology relied on by hospitals and clinics around the world to monitor more than 200 million patients every year.\nIn May 2024, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Masimo Stork™, a baby monitoring system that provides alarms to parents or other caregivers, for use\nwith healthy babies 0-18 months of age, without the need for a prescription. The FDA-cleared OTC version of Masimo Stork™ monitors a baby’s key vitals\ndata, including oxygen saturation level (SpO2), pulse rate (PR), and skin temperature; crucially Masimo Stork™ notifies caregivers with visual and audible\nalarms if a baby’s SpO2 or PR readings fall outside of preset ranges.\nIn August 2024, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of the Masimo W1® Medical Watch for connectivity, allowing it to be integrated with the Masimo\nSafetyNet® comprehensive telemonitoring solution. Masimo W1® Medical received FDA clearance last year as the first medical watch to provide continuous\noxygen saturation (SpO) and pulse rate (PR) for over-the-counter and prescription use at home and in hospitals. The combination of Masimo W1® Medical and\n2\nMasimo SafetyNet® allows accurate and reliable patient data, collected conveniently and comfortably via the wrist, to be made available on the Masimo\nSafetyNet® smartphone app and reviewed by remote caregivers, including by hospital clinicians on the web-based Masimo SafetyNet® clinician portal,\nanywhere and at any time.\nNon-healthcare\nIn May 2024, we unveiled the latest evolution of our acclaimed Denon PerL™ and Denon PerL Pro™ True Wireless earbud lineup with the introduction of White\nPerL™. Denon PerL™ represents the epitome of personalized audio listening. The two Denon PerL™ models are engineered with Masimo’s proprietary Adaptive\nAcoustic Technology™ (AAT™) to deliver the only earbud that puts hearing personalization at the forefront of the listening experience.\nEconomic Trends and Developments Effecting Our Business\nEconomic Trends\nThe healthcare and non-healthcare markets we operate in are highly competitive and dynamic, and experienced a number of headwinds in 2023, including but\nnot limited to inflationary pressures, interest rates volatility, rising energy costs, recessionary trends, and foreign currency fluctuations. All of these have\naffected the global economic environment, along with the healthcare facility spending trends and consumer spending behaviors which ultimately affect the\nCompany’s performance. While we experienced some short-term volatility in both our healthcare and non-healthcare segments, we are optimistic about long-\nterm growth due to our new product launches, our continued investment in expanding markets and embedding our improved technologies into our product\nportfolio.\n52\nTable of Contents\nIn an effort to bolster our long-term financial position, during the first quarter of 2023, we initiated various cost reduction actions to better optimize our cost\nstructure with near-term revenue to enhance our operating cash flow, and improve our profitability for both segments going forward. Our initial focus was on a\nreduction of variable costs, with specific attention to eliminating cost inefficiencies in our supply chain and reducing variable labor spend and overhead costs in\nour production facilities by shifting manufacturing of certain products to lower cost locations. Through the second and third quarters of 2023, we expanded\nthese actions by streamlining operations, including the consolidation and rationalization of business activities and facilities, workforce reductions, suspension\nof incentive bonus compensation and annual salary adjustments, transfers of product lines between manufacturing facilities, and the transfer of other business\nactivities between sites.\nAt the same time, we also revisited our revenue forecasts to reflect the current lower than expected U.S. hospital inpatient census, elevated sensor inventory\nlevels at some customers due to discounting in prior quarters, and other factors that negatively affected revenues. Specifically, during fiscal year 2022 and into\nthe early part of the second quarter of 2023, the Company sold products at a discount which led to elevated inventory levels at customers and delayed\nreordering for our single-patient use sensors and consumables and which, along with other factors, negatively impacted our business in the second quarter of\n2023 and to a lesser extent in subsequent quarters.\nNon-healthcare revenues for the second and third quarters of 2024 were within our guidance range and despite difficult conditions that are affecting\ndiscretionary consumer spending. In an effort to bolster headphone and earbud sales, we recently launched two new strategic endorsement partnerships for the\nBowers & Wilkins™ and Denon™ brands that are expected to provide growth opportunities to the non-healthcare business. See Note 24, “Commitments and\nContingencies” to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional information.\nSeasonality\nEach of our business segments is individually influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory\napprovals, holiday schedules, hospital census, clinicians, nurses and hospital personnel, the timing of the influenza season, holiday seasons, consumer\npressures, fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary and recessionary pressures, consumer demand and preferences, competitors’ marketing promotions and\nsales incentives; among many other factors.\nOur healthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality of\nthe U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer elective procedures utilizing our healthcare products.\nOur non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year historically produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other quarters of\nour fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. Our promotional discounting activity may negatively impact\nour gross margin during the holiday periods and into the trailing period (depending on our annual 52/53 week fiscal year end calendar).\nOn-Going Russian-Ukraine Conflict, Israel-Palestine-Iran War\nWe continue to monitor the uncertainty from conflicts and wars in Russia, the Ukraine, Israel and Iran, with respect to on-going business in such regions, and\nare continuing to support existing patient populations while remaining compliant with all applicable U.S. and EU sanctions and regulations, where applicable.\nWhile none of Russia, the Ukraine or Israel constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the\ncurrent scope of the conflicts in either geographic region, including the Middle East, could have an impact on our business. In the interim, order acceptance for\nRussia has been halted. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, sales derived from customers based in Russia represented an immaterial percentage of\nour total revenue.\nExecutive Leadership and Board Transitions\nAt our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders held on September 19, 2024, our stockholders voted to elect William Jellison and Darlene Solomon to the Board,\nthe voting results of which were certified by the independent inspector of election on September 24, 2024. On September 19, 2024, Joe Kiani delivered a notice\nto our Board stating his decision to resign from his position as our CEO. On September 24, 2024, our Board appointed director Michelle Brennan to serve as\nour interim CEO, effective September 24, 2024, and the Board retained Korn Ferry to assist with CEO succession planning.\nOn October 16, 2024, our Board increased the authorized number of directors on our Board to eight and, in connection with such increase, appointed Timothy\nJ. Scannell and Wendy E. Lane as Class III directors of Masimo, effective October 16, 2024.\nOn October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment, effective October 24, 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRelated Party Transactions\nWillow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor Laboratories, Inc., is an independent entity spun off from us to our stockholders in 1998. Our\nformer Chairman and CEO, Mr. Kiani, is the Chairman and CEO of Willow. We are a party to a cross-licensing agreement with Willow, which was amended\nand restated effective January 1, 2007 (the Cross-Licensing Agreement), which governs each party’s rights to certain intellectual property held by the two\ncompanies. See Note 3, “Related Party Transactions”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to Willow.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as U.S. Dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in million, except percentages) (in million, except percentages)\nSeptember 28, Percentage September 30, Percentage September 28, Percentage September 30, Percentage\n2024 of Revenue 2023 of Revenue 2024 of Revenue 2023 of Revenue\nRevenue(1) $ 504.6 100.0 % $ 478.9 100.0 % $ 1,493.7 100.0 % $ 1,499.2 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 241.4 47.8 244.1 51.0 734.0 49.1 758.4 50.6\nGross profit 263.2 52.2 234.8 49.0 759.7 50.9 740.8 49.4\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and\nadministrative 184.8 36.6 156.1 32.6 522.2 35.0 504.1 33.6\nResearch and\ndevelopment 48.3 9.6 46.5 9.7 145.1 9.7 137.2 9.2\nImpairment charge — — 7.0 1.5 — — 7.0 0.5\nTotal operating expenses 233.1 46.2 209.6 43.8 667.3 44.7 648.3 43.3\nOperating income 30.1 6.0 25.2 5.2 92.4 6.2 92.5 6.1\nNon-operating loss (18.5) (3.7) (11.2) (2.3) (36.0) (2.4) (27.5) (1.8)\nIncome before provision\nfor income taxes 11.6 2.3 14.0 2.9 56.4 3.8 65.0 4.3\nProvision for income\ntaxes 1.8 0.4 3.4 0.7 11.7 0.8 17.4 1.2\nNet income $ 9.8 1.9 % $ 10.6 2.2 % $ 44.7 3.0 % $ 47.6 3.1 %\nComparison of the Three Months ended September 28, 2024 to the Three Months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue. Revenue increased $25.7 million, or 5.4%, to $504.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from $478.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue by segment: Revenue by segment is comprised of healthcare and non-healthcare segments. The healthcare segment consists of hospital products and\nservices. The non-healthcare segment consists of consumer audio visual and sound related products. The following table details our revenues by segment for\neach of the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions, except percentage)\nSeptember 28, September 30, Increase/ Percentage\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Change\nHealthcare $ 343.3 68.0 % $ 307.8 64.3 % $ 35.5 11.5 %\nNon-healthcare 161.3 32.0 171.1 35.7 (9.8) (5.7)\nRevenue $ 504.6 100.0 % $ 478.9 100.0 % $ 25.7 5.4 %\n54\nTable of Contents\nHealthcare segment revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased $35.5 million, or 11.5%, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, due to increased sales of consumables and sensor parameters. However, revenues were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.6\nmillion of foreign exchange rate movements from the prior year period that decreased the U.S. Dollar translation of foreign sales that were denominated in\nvarious foreign currencies.\nRevenue generated through our direct and distribution sales channels increased $35.1 million, or 12.7%, to $310.7 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 compared to $275.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from our OEM channel increased $0.4 million, or\n1.2%, to $32.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to $32.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the three months ended September 28, 2024, we shipped approximately 60,500 noninvasive technology boards and instruments.\nFor the three months ended September 28, 2024, non-healthcare revenue decreased $9.8 million, or 5.7%, compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Non-healthcare revenues were within our guidance range despite this business being affected by the weakening environment for luxury consumer\npurchases, as well as slowness in the housing market, which has affected installations and upgrades for our home audio components.\nGross Profit. Gross profit consists of revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes labor, material, overhead and other similar costs related to the\nproduction, supply, distribution and support of our products. Our gross profit for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was as\nfollows:\nGross Profit\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$263.2 52.2% $234.8 49.0% $28.4 12.1%\nCost of goods sold decreased $2.7 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily\ndue to product mix. Gross profit increased to 52.2% for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 49.0% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily due to increased healthcare revenues with strong product mix margins, which were partially offset by certain manufacturing\ntransition expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses\nfor sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales commissions, advertising, marketing, promotion costs, licensing fees, professional fees related to legal,\naccounting and other outside services, public company costs and other corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months\nended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nSelling, General and Administrative\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$184.8 36.6% $156.1 32.6% $28.7 18.4%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $28.7 million, or 18.4%, for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher legal and professional fees of approximately $26.8 million, the return of\nperformance-based compensation to normal levels in 2024 and other employee-related costs of approximately $12.8 million, and higher amortization expense\nof approximately $1.5 million, which were partially offset by a stock-based compensation benefit of approximately $7.1 million, lower occupancy and other\noffice expenses of approximately $4.7 million, lower transaction-related expenses of approximately $0.4 million and lower advertising and marketing-related\ncosts of approximately $0.1 million.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses for engineers\nand other personnel engaged in the design and development of our products. These expenses also include third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype and\nengineering supply expenses and the costs of clinical trials. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 were as follows:\n55\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$48.3 9.6% $46.5 9.7% $1.8 3.9%\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.8 million, or 3.9%, for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation and other employee-related costs of approximately $5.4 million, which\nwere offset by lower engineering project costs of approximately $2.0 million, lower occupancy and other office expenses of approximately $1.3 million, lower\nprofessional fees of approximately $0.4 million and lower amortization expense of approximately $0.1 million.\nImpairment Charge\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$— —% $7.0 —% $(7.0) (100.0)%\nImpairment charge consists of charges or writedowns of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles that exceed their estimated fair value, or\nrecoverability, as applicable. During the third quarter of 2023, we experienced continued declines in our stock price and certain worsening macro-economic\nmarket conditions, which contributed to a significant decline in our market capitalization. Based on these factors, we determined that there was a triggering\nevent for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which required an interim impairment assessment. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment\ntest of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and a recoverability test for other long-lived assets with finite lives. This quantitative assessment indicated that\nthe carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $7.0 million. No impairment of goodwill was\nidentified, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of September 30, 2023.\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, the fair values were estimated using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, which involves forecasting\navoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. For certain of\nthese intangibles, the discount rate assumed in the analysis was 15.0%, and a 1.0% change would equate to approximately $14.0 million in fair value, all other\nvariables remaining constant. For the goodwill impairment assessment, the fair value of our healthcare reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying\nvalue. For our non-healthcare reporting unit, the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12%. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is\njudgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include the discount rate and forecasted revenue growth rates and operating\nmargins, to calculate projected future discounted cash flows. The forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins assume recovery from the current\nbusiness downturn while also employing strategies to expand in key market segments. The discount rate assumed in the analysis was 13.0% and considered\ncertain factors such as company specific risks. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would equate to approximately $140.0 million in fair value, all other\nvariables remaining constant. If future actual results adversely deviate from the forecast in the analysis, there will be a materially different assessment. As such,\nwe will continue to monitor events occurring or circumstances changing which may necessitate further impairment assessments for goodwill, intangibles and\nother long-lived assets.\nWe review goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of the year or more\nfrequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment, and should our stock price, macro-economic market conditions or related forecast\nrevisions market conditions continue to deteriorate, the result of such review may indicate additional declines in the fair value of goodwill or intangible assets,\nrequiring additional impairment charges in the future.\nNon-operating loss. Non-operating loss consists primarily of interest income, interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses. Non-operating loss for\nthe three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was as follows:\nNon-operating loss\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of (Increase)/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues Decrease Change\n$(18.5) (3.7)% $(11.2) (2.3)% $(7.3) 65.2%\nNon-operating loss was $18.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to $11.2 million of non-operating loss for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. This increase in the non-operating loss of approximately $7.3\n56\nTable of Contents\nmillion was primarily due to interest expense incurred under our various lines of credit and borrowing facilities of approximately $10.5 million and the net\nrealized and unrealized foreign currency denominated transactions of approximately $9.3 million, offset by interest income on cash deposits of approximately\n$1.3 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was as follows:\nProvision for Income Taxes\n(in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Percentage of Three Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$1.8 0.4% $3.4 0.7% $(1.6) (47.1)%\nFor the three months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $1.8 million, or an effective tax provision rate of\n15.5%, as compared to a provision for income taxes of approximately $3.4 million, or an effective tax provision rate of 24.3%, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in our income tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of\nexcess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation of approximately $1.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nComparison of the Nine Months ended September 28, 2024 to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue. Revenue decreased $5.5 million, or 0.4%, to $1,493.7 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from $1,499.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue by segment: Revenue by segment is comprised of healthcare and non-healthcare segments. The healthcare segment consists of hospital products and\nservices. The non-healthcare segment consists of consumer audio visual and sound-related products. The following table details our revenues by segment for\neach of the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nNine Months Ended\n(in millions, except percentages)\nSeptember 28, September 30, Increase/ Percentage\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Change\nHealthcare $ 1,026.8 68.7 % $ 935.6 62.4 % $ 91.2 9.7 %\nNon-healthcare 466.9 31.3 563.6 37.6 (96.7) (17.2)\nRevenue $ 1,493.7 100.0 % $ 1,499.2 100.0 % $ (5.5) (0.4)%\nHealthcare revenues for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased $91.2 million, or 9.7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\ndue to increased sales of consumables and sensor parameters, and the effect of discounting practices in the comparable period, most notably in the second\nquarter of 2023. During fiscal year 2022 and into the early part of the second quarter of 2023, the Company sold products at a discount which led to elevated\ninventory levels at customers and delayed reordering for our single-patient use sensors and consumables and which, along with other factors, negatively\nimpacted our business in the second quarter of 2023 and to a lesser extent in subsequent quarters.\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, healthcare revenues were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $4.0 million of foreign exchange rate\nmovements from the prior year period that decreased the U.S. Dollar translation of foreign sales that were denominated in various foreign currencies.\nRevenue generated through our direct and distribution sales channels increased $99.2 million, or 11.8%, to $937.3 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024, compared to $838.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from our OEM channel decreased $8.0 million, or\n8.2%, to $89.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to $97.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we shipped approximately 169,500 noninvasive technology boards and instruments.\nThe non-healthcare segment saw continued slowing for consumer audio products, which declined 17.2% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, as a\nresult of the difficult macroenvironment for consumer discretionary purchases, which also adversely affected the market for our luxury consumer products. In\naddition, we were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of approximately $3.9 million from the prior year period that decreased the U.S.\nDollar translation of foreign sales that were denominated in various foreign currencies.\n57\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit. Gross profit consists of total revenue less cost of goods sold.

Gross profit increased to 50.9% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 49.4% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to product mix between the segments, partially offset by various manufacturing expense inefficiencies, and\nthe effect of discounting practices in the comparable period, most notably in the second quarter of 2023. During fiscal year 2022 and into the early part of the\nsecond quarter of 2023, the Company sold products at a discount which led to elevated inventory levels at customers and delayed reordering for our single-\npatient use sensors and consumables and which, along with other factors, negatively impacted our business in the second quarter of 2023 and to a lesser extent\nin subsequent quarters.\nSelling, General and Administrative.

This net increase in the non-operating loss of approximately $8.5 million was primarily due to interest expense incurred under our\nvarious lines of credit and borrowing facilities of approximately $33.6 million and the net realized and unrealized foreign currency denominated transactions of\napproximately $6.1 million, offset by interest income on cash deposits of approximately $3.7 million.\n59\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was as follows:\nProvision for Income Taxes\n(in millions, except percentages)\nNine Months Ended Percentage of Nine Months Ended Percentage of Increase/ Percentage\nSeptember 28, 2024 Net Revenues September 30, 2023 Net Revenues (Decrease) Change\n$11.7 0.8% $17.4 1.2% $(5.7) (32.8)%\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $11.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.7%, as\ncompared to a provision for income taxes of approximately $17.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 26.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in our income tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of excess tax benefits\nrealized from stock-based compensation of approximately $1.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and changes in geographic\ncomposition of income, offset by certain non-deductible items.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity consist of our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, future funds expected to be generated from operations and available\nborrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately $642.3 million in working capital, of which approximately\n$158.5 million was in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to net working capital, as of September 28, 2024, we had approximately $245.7 million of\navailable borrowing capacity (net of outstanding letters of credit) under our Credit Facility.\nWe currently maintain a Credit Facility which provides for $705.0 million of unsecured borrowings. The Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to\n$50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. Proceeds from the Credit Facility are being used for general corporate, capital investment and expenditures\nand working capital needs. For additional information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn managing our day-to-day liquidity and capital structure, we generally do not rely on foreign earnings as a source of funds. As of September 28, 2024, we had\ncash totaling $60.9 million held outside of the U.S., of which approximately $31.3 million was accessible without additional tax cost and approximately $29.6\nmillion was accessible at an incremental estimated tax cost of up to $0.2 million. We currently have sufficient funds on-hand and cash held outside the U.S. that\nis available without additional tax cost to fund our global operations. In the event funds that are treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, we may be\nrequired to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nOur cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, market acceptance of our technologies, our continued ability to\ncommercialize new products and to create or improve our technologies and applications, expansion of our global footprint through acquisitions and/or strategic\ninvestments in technologies or technology companies, hedging and derivative activities, investments in property and equipment, the renewal of our Credit\nFacility, the impact of disruptions to the manufacturing industry supply chain for key components, inflation, repurchases of our stock under our authorized\nstock repurchase program, costs related to our domestic and international regulatory requirements and other long-term commitments and contingencies. For\nfurther information regarding our commitment and contingencies, see Note 24 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nPart IV, Item 15(a) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to\naccelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others,\nnegotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and\ncollections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial\ninstitutions.\nDespite recent acquisitions and strategic investment expenditures, we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit\nFacility, and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund on-going operating and capital expenditures, working capital\nrequirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12 months.\n60\nTable of Contents\nShould we require additional funds in the future to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes, we may seek to raise such additional funds\nthrough debt financing, as well as from other sources such as through our effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-262770)\non file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. No assurance can be given that additional\nfinancing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable when required.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 145.9 $ 17.0\nInvesting activities (34.7) (55.9)\nFinancing activities (119.1) (20.8)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash 3.4 (17.6)\nDecrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (4.5) $ (77.3)\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was approximately $145.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, generated\nprimarily from net income from operations of $44.7 million. Non-cash activity included depreciation and amortization of approximately $72.2 million and\nstock-based compensation expense of approximately $29.6 million.\nOther major changes in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in other non-current liabilities, lease receivable, deferred revenue and other contract-\nrelated liabilities, and income taxes payable of approximately $9.0 million, $7.1 million, $3.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing\nof payments; an increase in inventories, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued compensation, other current assets, accounts receivable and deferred\ncosts and other contract assets of approximately $40.1 million, $29.4 million, $24.6 million, $13.3 million, $12.3 million, $9.4 million and $2.3 million,\nrespectively, primarily due to inventory build-up and the timing of payments.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was approximately $17.0 million, generated primarily from net income\nfrom operations of $47.6 million. Non-cash activity included depreciation and amortization of approximately $75.8 million, stock-based benefit of\napproximately $2.4 million and an impairment charge of $7.0 million. Other major changes in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in accounts\nreceivable, accrued compensation, accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and deferred costs and other contract assets of approximately $84.8 million, $32.8\nmillion, $19.5 million, $7.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of payments and our cost reduction strategies; an increase in net,\ninventories, other non-current assets, other non-current liabilities and other current assets, of approximately $93.1 million, $42.0 million, $22.5 million, $14.6\nmillion, respectively, primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory build-up.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was approximately $34.7 million, consisting primarily of\napproximately $23.6 million of capitalized intangible asset costs related primarily to patent and trademark costs and license fees, approximately $24.5 million\nfor purchases of property and equipment, and approximately $0.1 million of strategic investments, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of property and\nequipment of approximately $13.5 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was approximately $55.9 million, consisting primarily of approximately $33.1\nmillion for purchases of property and equipment, approximately $29.3 million of capitalized intangible asset costs related primarily to patent and trademark\ncosts and license fees, and approximately $1.0 million of strategic investments, which were offset by approximately $7.5 million from escrow funds associated\nwith a business combination.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was approximately $119.1 million, consisting primarily\nof repayment on the line of credit of approximately $207.2 million, and withholding of shares for employee payroll taxes for vested equity awards of\napproximately $6.0 million, which were offset by proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit of approximately $72.7 million and the issuance of\ncommon stock related to employee equity awards of approximately $21.4 million.\n61\nTable of Contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was approximately $20.8 million, consisting primarily of repayment on the\nline of credit of approximately $154.3 million, and withholding of shares for employee payroll taxes for vested equity awards of approximately $12.7 million,\nwhich were offset by proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit of approximately $139.5 million and the issuance of common stock related to employee\nequity awards of approximately $6.7 million.\nCapital Resources and Prospective Capital Requirements\nWe expect to fund our future operating, investing and financing activities through our available cash, future cash from operations, our Credit Facility and other\npotential sources of capital. In addition to funding our working capital requirements, we anticipate additional capital expenditures primarily related to\ninvestments in infrastructure growth. Possible additional uses of cash may include acquisitions of and/or strategic investments in technologies or technology\ncompanies, investments in property, repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program and continued legal defense of our\nintellectual property. However, any repurchases of common stock will be subject to numerous factors, including the availability of our common stock, general\nmarket conditions, the trading price of our common stock, availability of capital, alternative uses for capital and our financial performance. In addition, the\namount and timing of our actual investing activities will vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of capital\nexpenditures, costs of product development efforts, our timetable for infrastructure expansion, any stock repurchase activity and costs related to our domestic\nand international regulatory requirements. Despite these strategic investment requirements and potential expenditures, we anticipate that our existing cash and\ncash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facility and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund on-going\noperating and capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12 months. We may require additional funds\nin the future to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through debt financing, as well as\nfrom other sources. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on\nterms favorable when required. For additional information related to our Credit Facility, please see Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.\nWe regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to our critical accounting policies, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, stock-based\ncompensation, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; business combinations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances,\nuncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, litigation costs and loss contingencies.\nThese estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and\nform the basis for making management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. Although we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these\nestimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. If these estimates differ significantly from actual\nresults, the impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements may be material.\nThere have been no material changes to any of our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, which was filed with the\nSEC on February 28, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor details regarding any recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n62\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks that may arise from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations and\ninflation. We do maintain a derivative instrument for cash flow hedging, but do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or\nspeculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our cash and cash\nequivalents and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments. As\nof September 28, 2024, the carrying value of our cash equivalents approximated fair value. We manage our risk associated with interest rates fluctuations\nrelated to interest expenses under our Credit Facility by engaging in hedging activities. Since July 2022, we entered into various interest rate swap contracts to\nhedge our exposure to changes in cash flows associated with our outstanding debt with variable interest rates. The interest rate swap contracts have maturities\naveraging five years or less. See Note 17, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase or decrease our interest rate yields on our\ninvestments, interest income and credit facilities by approximately $0.1 million for each $10.0 million in interest-bearing investments and by $0.1 million for\neach additional $10.0 million of debt.\nOur ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our\nhedging strategies at that time. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately\nless than $0.1 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 and\napproximately $0.3 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, for the nine months ended September 28,\n2024.\nWe sponsor multiple defined benefit pension plans covering certain international employees. The aggregate fair value of the plans’ investments was $25.6\nmillion as of September 28, 2024. The plans’ assets may be subject to market risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, which may affect the value of the plans’\nassets and the funding of the plans.\nIncreases in interest rates globally may impact the value of pension plan assets held by us. When interest rates increase, the value of fixed income securities,\nsuch as bonds, may decrease, which can negatively impact the fair value of the pension plan assets. However, interest rate increases may also improve the\nfunded status of plan by increasing the discount rate used to measure the present value of the pension obligations and potentially decreasing our requirement to\nmake contributions to the plan. The most significant actuarial assumption affecting pension expense and pension obligations is discount rates. A hypothetical\nincrease of 100 basis point in discount rates would result in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in the projected benefit obligation. The impact of interest\nrate increases on the pension plan assets and funded status may not be predictable and may vary from period to period.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nA majority of our assets and liabilities are maintained in the United States in U.S. Dollars and a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in U.S.\nDollars. However, we also transact with foreign customers in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S.\nDollars, can vary depending on average exchange rates during a respective period. In addition, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in their respective\ncountry’s local currency, which is also their functional currency. As a result, expenses of these foreign subsidiaries, when converted into U.S. Dollars can also\nvary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as our foreign currency\ndenominated cash balances and certain intercompany transactions. In addition, other transactions between us or our subsidiaries and a third-party, denominated\nin a currency different from the functional currency, are foreign currency transactions. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these\ntransactions are also included in our statements of operations as incurred.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe balance sheets of each of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange\nat the balance sheet date and the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average\nmonthly exchange rates applicable during the period. Any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our foreign currency\nexchange rate exposures are primarily with the Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Swedish Krona, the British Pound, Mexican Peso, Turkish Lira,\nAustralian Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Foreign currency exchange rates may experience significant volatility from one period to the next.\nWe do not use derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The effect of additional changes in foreign currency exchange rates\ncould have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows, depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and depending on the\ndirectional change (either a strengthening or weakening against the U.S. Dollar). We estimate that the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in\nall applicable foreign currency exchange rates from the rates in effect as of September 28, 2024 would have resulted in an estimated reduction of $10.7 million\nin reported pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. As our foreign operations continue to grow, our exposure to foreign currency\nexchange rate risk may become more significant.\nInflation Risk\nConsumer demand and discretionary spending have been impacted by inflationary pressures over recent years. Based on recent announcements from the U.S.\nFederal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve), the Federal Reserve believes that inflation has begun to ease, which was signaled by a reduction of federal\nborrowing rates. This reduction is expected to positively impact consumer spending in the near future. Changes in inflation, interest rates and consumer\nspending could materially impact our financial results, in particular, our consumer products and non-healthcare business segment.\nIf we are unable to determine the impact of inflation on our global business, our financial condition, our results of operations during the periods presented\ncould be adversely impacted. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs\nthrough price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange\nAct, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulations, rules\nand forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange\nAct, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our interim CEO and CFO, of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on the foregoing, our interim CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the three months ended September 28, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information set forth in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption\n“Litigation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\n64\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties\ndescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also\nimpair our business operations. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth\nprospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all\nor part of your investment. Risk factors marked with an asterisk (*) below include a substantive change from or an update to the risk factors included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\n65\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Material Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that\nwe face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this summary, and other risks that we face, can be found following this summary and should be\ncarefully considered together with all of the other information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n• We currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our Masimo SET® platform, Masimo rainbow SET® platform and related products. If these\ntechnologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\n• Some of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit our\ngrowth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n(cid:0)(cid:135)\nOur ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® and our licensed rainbow®\ntechnology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor\nLaboratories, Inc., which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• We depend on our domestic and international original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote\nsufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\n• If we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our healthcare products would decline.\n• Inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our healthcare products, or for procedures using our\nhealthcare products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\n• *The loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer or international tender, or any\nnon-payment, non-performance or disagreement or dispute with any customer or distributor could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\n• Counterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n• Competition and other conflicts with our non-healthcare distribution partners could harm our business and operating results.\n• *If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our\ncompetitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\n• If third-parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling\ncertain products.\n• *We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate litigation to\nprotect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management’s attention from implementing our\nbusiness strategy.\n• Our failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current, upgraded\nor new healthcare products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\n• If our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or\nserious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and other applicable laws, and may need to initiate voluntary or mandatory\ncorrective actions, such as the recall of our healthcare products.\n• Promotion of our healthcare products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\n• *The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving. Many of the laws and regulations\nin this area are subject to uncertain interpretation, and our failure to comply could result in claims, penalties or increased costs or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\n• We may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties if we\nare unable to fully comply with these laws.\n• *We may experience conflicts of interest with Willow with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\n66\nTable of Contents\n• We will be required to assign to Willow and pay Willow for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring of\nnon-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®.\n• In the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Willow grants a license to rainbow® technology to a third-party, our\nbusiness would be adversely affected.\n• If we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to customers.\n• *Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions or separations of businesses and strategic investments or joint ventures, could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses and their employees successfully into our existing\noperations or achieve the desired results of our initiatives.\n• *Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or generate\nrevenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial\nresults.\n• Our Credit Facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\n• We have incurred impairment charges for other intangible assets, and may incur further impairment charges in the future, which would negatively impact\nour operating results.\n• We may need additional capital and failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business and\ndevelop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\n• Concentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from\ninfluencing significant corporate decisions.\n• We may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately plan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet our\npublicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results.\n• *Our corporate documents, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent\nattempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\n• *Recent changes to our senior leadership and our Board could create uncertainties and adversely impact our business.\n• Exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or employees.\n• *A dispute with our former Chairman and CEO Mr. Kiani with respect to his Amended Employment Agreement could be costly and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\n67\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Revenues\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our Masimo SET® platform, Masimo rainbow SET® platform and related products. If\nthese technologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nOur healthcare business is highly dependent upon the continued success and market acceptance of our proprietary Masimo SET® and Masimo rainbow SET®\ntechnologies that serve as the basis of our primary healthcare product offerings. Continued market acceptance of products incorporating these technologies will\ndepend upon us continuing to provide evidence to the medical community that our products are cost-effective and offer significantly improved performance\ncompared to conventional pulse oximeters. Healthcare providers that currently have significant investments in competitive pulse oximetry products may be\nreluctant to purchase our products. If hospitals and other healthcare providers do not believe our Masimo SET® and Masimo rainbow SET® platforms are cost-\neffective, safe or more accurate or reliable than competitive pulse oximetry products, they may not buy our healthcare products in sufficient quantities to enable\nus to generate revenue growth from the sale of these products. In addition, allegations regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products, whether or not\nsubstantiated, may impair or impede the acceptance of our products.\nSome of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit\nour growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our noninvasive measurement technologies are considered disruptive. These technologies have performance levels that we believe are acceptable for\nmany clinical environments but may be insufficient in others. In addition, these technologies may perform better in some patients and settings than others. Over\ntime, we hope to continue to improve the performance of these technologies and educate the clinical community on how to properly evaluate them. If we are\nsuccessful in these endeavors, we expect these technologies will become more useful in more environments and will become more widely adopted. Our product\nportfolio continues to expand, and we are investing significant resources to enter into, and in some cases create, new markets for our products. For example,\nour acquisition of Sound United expanded our business and product strategy to additionally focus on non-healthcare products to integrate with our successful\nmedical technology. See the risk factor with the heading “Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound\nUnited could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could\nadversely affect our business, reputation or financial results” for additional risks related to this expansion of our business.\nWe are continuing to invest in sales and marketing resources to achieve market acceptance of our products, but are unable to guarantee that our technologies\nwill achieve general market acceptance.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our healthcare products will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• perceived clinical benefits from our products;\n• perceived cost effectiveness of our products;\n• perceived safety and effectiveness of our products;\n• reimbursement available through government and private healthcare programs for using some of our products; and\n• introduction and acceptance of competing products or technologies.\nFurther, market acceptance of our non-healthcare products will depend on certain additional factors, including but not limited to:\n• perceived quality of our non-healthcare brands and technology;\n• our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand and maintain manufacturing capacity to meet such demand;\n• our ability to introduce new innovative products that align with rapidly changing consumer tastes; and\n• implementation of pricing and marketing strategies that drive consumer adoption without eroding our premium market position.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance or if our customers prefer our competitors’ products, our potential revenue growth would be limited, which\nwould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n68\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® and our licensed rainbow®\ntechnology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor\nLaboratories, Inc., which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 1998, we have been a party to a cross-licensing agreement with Willow (as amended, the Cross-Licensing Agreement), under which we granted Willow:\n• an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET® technology owned by us, including all improvements to this\ntechnology, for the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters and to develop and sell devices incorporating Masimo SET® for monitoring non-vital signs\nparameters (alone or in combination with vital signs parameters) in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist\nrather than by a professional medical caregiver, which we refer to as the “Willow Market”; and\n• an option for a non-exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET® technology owned by us for measurement\nof vital signs in the “Willow Market”.\nNon-vital signs measurements consist of body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements, including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide,\nmethemoglobin, blood glucose, hemoglobin and bilirubin. Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we are only permitted to sell devices utilizing Masimo SET®\nfor the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters in markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver, including, but not\nlimited to, hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers, rather than by a patient or pharmacist, which we refer to as the “Masimo Market”.\nAccordingly, our ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® is limited. In particular,\nour inability to expand beyond the “Masimo Market” may limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nPursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we have licensed from Willow the right to make and distribute products in the “Masimo Market” that utilize\nrainbow® technology for certain noninvasive measurements. As a result, the opportunity to expand the market for our products incorporating rainbow®\ntechnology is also limited, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nWe depend on our domestic and international original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote\nsufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent upon our domestic and international OEM partners for a portion of our revenue through their marketing, selling and\ndistribution of certain of their products that incorporate our technologies. Although we expect that our OEM partners will accept and actively market, sell and\ndistribute products that incorporate our technologies, they may not do so. Because products that incorporate our technologies may represent a relatively small\npercentage of business for some of our OEM partners, they may have less incentive to promote these products over other products that do not incorporate these\ntechnologies.\nIn addition, some of our OEM partners offer products that compete with ours and also may be involved in intellectual property disputes with us. Therefore, we\ncannot guarantee that our OEM partners, or any company that may acquire any of our OEM partners, will vigorously promote products incorporating our\ntechnologies. The failure of our OEM partners to successfully market, sell or distribute products incorporating our technologies, the termination of OEM\nagreements, the loss of OEM partners or the inability to enter into future OEM partnership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our healthcare products would decline.\nOur ability to sell our healthcare products to hospitals depends, in part, on our relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential customers for our products\nare members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts with medical supply manufacturers and distributors that may include provisions for\nsole sourcing and bundling, which generally reduce the choices available to member hospitals.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThese negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, the GPO’s members may be less likely\nor unlikely to purchase our products. If a GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer’s\nproducts, we may be prohibited from making sales to members of such GPO for the duration of such contractual arrangement. Shipments of our pulse oximetry\nproducts to customers that are members of GPOs represent approximately 95% of our U.S. healthcare product sales. Our failure to renew our contracts with\nGPOs may cause us to lose market share in our healthcare business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, if we are unable to develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer and our opportunities to grow\nour revenues and business would be harmed.\nInadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our healthcare products, or for procedures using\nour healthcare products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\nSales of our healthcare products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private healthcare payers. The lack of\nadequate coverage and reimbursement for our healthcare products or the procedures in which our healthcare products are used may deter customers from\npurchasing our products.\nWe cannot guarantee that governmental or third-party payers will reimburse or begin reimbursing a customer for the cost of our healthcare products or the\nprocedures in which our healthcare products are used. For example, some insurance carriers have issued policies denying coverage for transcutaneous\nhemoglobin measurement on the grounds that the technology is investigational in the outpatient setting. Other payers are continuing to investigate our products\nto determine if they will provide reimbursement for the use of such products. In addition, we may incur significant expenses to generate clinical data to\ndemonstrate not only the safety and efficacy, but also the cost-effectiveness of our products in order to obtain favorable reimbursement policies from payers.\nThese trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current and future healthcare products, hinder our ability to obtain market adoption, cause a\ndecrease in the size of the market or potentially increase competition, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe do not control payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to\nexplore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called “pay-for-performance” programs implemented by various\npublic government healthcare programs and private third-party payers, and expansion of payment bundling initiatives, and other such methods that shift\nmedical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our current products or products we develop in the future.\nOutside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary by country. These systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising healthcare costs and control\nhealthcare expenditures as those in the U.S. In addition, as economies of emerging markets develop, these countries may implement changes in their healthcare\ndelivery and payment systems. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U.S. are not obtained, sales of our products outside of\nthe U.S. may be adversely affected.\n*Our healthcare customers may reduce, delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors, such as lower hospital census levels or third-party\nguidelines, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur healthcare customers are facing growing levels of uncertainties, including variations in overall hospital census for paying patients and the impact of such\ncensus variations on hospital budgets. As a result, many hospitals are reevaluating their entire cost structure, including the amount of capital they allocate to\nmedical device technologies and products. In addition, certain of our products, including our rainbow® measurements such as carbon monoxide,\nmethemoglobin and hemoglobin, that are sold with upfront license fees and more complex and expensive sensors, could also be impacted by hospital budget\nreductions. Any reductions in capital spending budgets by hospitals could have a significant negative impact on our OEM customers who, due to their\ntraditionally larger capital equipment sales model, could see declines in purchases from their hospital customers. This, in turn, could reduce our board sales to\nour OEM customers.\nFrom time to time, states and other local regulatory authorities may issue guidelines regarding the appropriate scope and use of our products. For example,\nsome of our noninvasive monitoring devices may be subject to authorization by individual states as part of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) scope of\npractice procedures. A lack of inclusion into scope of practice procedures may limit adoption of our products.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, increases in demand resulting from global medical crises, such as the increase in demand we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nbe short lived. If the increased demand results in a stockpiling of our healthcare products by, or excess inventory at, our customers, future orders may be\ndelayed or canceled until such on-hand inventory is consumed. We may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately\nplan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results. Continued stockpiling\nor excess inventory as a result of lower hospital census in future quarters could also negatively impact our healthcare revenue.\n*The loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer or international tender, or\nany non-payment, non-performance or disagreement or dispute with any customer or distributor could reduce our net sales and harm our operating\nresults.\nOur healthcare business has a concentration of OEM, distributor and direct customers. For example, sales to one just-in-time distributor represented 10% or\nmore of our consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024. There were no revenue concentrations for our non-healthcare business, which represented 10%\nor more of our consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will retain our current customers, international tenders, groups of customers or distributors, that they will maintain\ntheir current or forecasted demand for our products, or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future. If for any reason we were to\nlose our ability to sell to a specific group or class of customers or through a distributor, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue or loss of market\nshare, which would adversely impact our operating results.\nOur revenues could also be negatively affected by any rebates, discounts or fees that are required by, or offered to, GPOs and customers, including wholesalers\nor distributors. Additionally, one just-in-time distributor of our healthcare products has recently demanded higher fees, which we have agreed to pay in order to\ncontinue to offer products to our customers through this distributor. Specifically, in February 2024, we were notified by this distributor of its intent to terminate\nour distribution agreement as a result of our refusal to increase distribution fees. While we were ultimately able to reach an agreement with this distributor, the\nloss of any large customer or distributor, an increase in distributor fees, or the risks associated with selling directly to our customers could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any material non-payment or non-performance by any of our customers or distributors, a significant disagreement or dispute with any of our\ncustomers or distributors, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of our customers or distributors, the early\ntermination of any agreements with any of our customers or distributors, or any other event significantly negatively impacting our contractual relationship with\nany of our customers or distributors or any losses we may incur from any disagreements or disputed transactions and the resulting impact on the timing and\namount of any payments, or any delayed or withheld payments, due from our customers or distributors could adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nCounterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that other entities are manufacturing and selling counterfeit Masimo sensors. In addition, certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting\nour used single-patient-use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing, repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals. These counterfeit and third-party\nreprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors. Our experience with both these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessed sensors\nis that they provide inferior performance, increased sensor consumption, reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems. Notwithstanding these\nlimitations, some of our customers have indicated a willingness to purchase some of their sensor requirements from these counterfeit manufacturers and third-\nparty reprocessors in an effort to reduce their sensor costs.\nThese counterfeit and reprocessed sensors have led and may continue to lead to confusion with our genuine Masimo products, have reduced and may continue\nto reduce our revenue, and, in some cases, have harmed and may continue to harm our reputation if customers conclude incorrectly that these counterfeit or\nreprocessed sensors are original Masimo sensors.\nIn addition, we have expended a significant amount of time and expense investigating issues caused by counterfeit and reprocessed sensors, troubleshooting\nproblems stemming from such sensors, educating customers about why counterfeit and reprocessed sensors do not perform to their expectations, enforcing our\nproprietary rights against the counterfeit manufacturers and reprocessors, and enforcing our contractual rights.\nIn response to these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessors, we have incorporated X-Cal® technology into certain products to ensure our customers get\nthe performance they expect by using genuine Masimo sensors and that such sensors do\n71\nTable of Contents\nnot continue to be used beyond their useful life. However, some customers may object to the X-Cal® technology, potentially resulting in the loss of customers\nand revenues.\nWe also offer our own Masimo reprocessed sensors, which meet the same performance specifications as our new Masimo sensors, to our customers.\nReprocessed sensors sold by us are also offered at a lower price and, therefore, may reduce certain customer demand for our new sensors. As a result, increased\nsales of our own Masimo reprocessed sensors may result in lower revenues, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nCompetition and other conflicts with our non-healthcare distribution partners could harm our business and operating results.\nSeveral of our existing non-healthcare products compete, and future products may compete, with the product offerings of some of our significant channel and\ndistribution partners. These partners may choose to market and promote their own products over ours or could cease or reduce selling or promoting our\nproducts. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our non-healthcare products, or increased competition from our distribution partners for available\nshelf or website placement, especially during peak retail sales periods, could adversely affect our non-healthcare business. In addition, the expansion of our\ndirect-to-consumer channel in our non-healthcare business through our brand websites could increase our competition with our channel partners and cause\nthese partners to reduce their purchases of our non-healthcare products. Conflicts in our sales channels could arise and cause channel partners to divert\nresources away from the promotion and sale of our products. Any of these situations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n*If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to\nour competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. Our utilization of patent protection, trade secrets\nand a combination of copyright and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual\nproperty afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage.\nCertain of our patents related to our technologies have begun to expire. Upon the expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we generally lose some of our\nrights to exclude competitors from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases and several laws have been enacted that, in certain situations, potentially\nnarrow the scope of patent protection available and weaken the rights of patent owners. As a result, we believe large technology companies may be pursuing an\n“efficient infringement” strategy, having concluded that it is cheaper to infringe third-party intellectual property rights than to acquire, license or otherwise\nrespect them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional patents on commercially desirable improvements, that such additional\npatents will adequately protect our innovations or offset the effect of expiring patents, or that competitors will not be able to design around our patents.\n72\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, third-parties have challenged, and may continue to challenge, our issued patents through procedures such as Inter-Partes Review (IPR). In many\nIPR challenges, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) cancels or significantly narrows issued patent claims. IPR challenges could increase the\nuncertainties and costs associated with the maintenance, enforcement and defense of our issued and future patents and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the\ngovernmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to\nobtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future. For example, the complexity and uncertainty of European\npatent laws have also increased in recent years. In Europe, in June 2023, a new unitary patent system was introduced, which will significantly impact European\npatents, including those granted before the introduction of the system. Under the unitary patent system, after a European patent is granted, the patent proprietor\ncan request unitary effect, thereby getting a European patent with unitary effect (Unitary Patent). Each Unitary Patent is subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnitary Patent Court (UPC). As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Patents granted\nbefore the implementation of the UPC will have the option of opting out of the jurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries.\nPatents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC may be potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-based revocation challenge that, if successful, could\ninvalidate the patent in all countries who are signatories to the UPC. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of the new unitary patent system.\nWe also utilize unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and often rely on confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements\nwith our employees, OEM partners, independent distributors and consultants to protect such unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. However, such\nagreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or\nother breaches of the agreements, or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary\ninformation.\nWe rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to our brands and the names of some of our products. Common law trademarks\nprovide less protection than registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf third-parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue\nselling certain products.\nSearching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection,\nwhich may not be publicly-available information, or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our searches. In addition, some of our\nemployees were previously employed at our competitors. We may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed, or that we have used, trade secrets or\nother proprietary information of our employees’ former employers. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third-parties’ intellectual property rights may\nnot always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us, even those without merit, could:\n• be expensive and time-consuming to defend and result in payment of significant damages to third-parties;\n• force us to stop making or selling products that incorporate the intellectual property;\n• require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, product candidates and technologies;\n• require us to enter into royalty agreements that would increase the costs of our products;\n• require us to indemnify third-parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement\nclaims;\n• divert the attention of our management and other key employees; and\n• result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims\nare resolved;\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new patents obtained by our\ncompetitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced.\n73\nTable of Contents\n*We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate\nlitigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management’s attention from\nimplementing our business strategy.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends, in part, on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies, defending our patents and\npreserving our trade secrets. We were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent positions related to some of our pulse oximetry signal\nprocessing patents that resulted in various settlements. We believe some of the new market entrants in the healthcare and monitoring space, including some of\nthe world’s largest technology companies, and some consumer audio companies may be infringing our intellectual property, and we may be required to engage\nin additional litigation to protect our intellectual property in the future. In addition, we believe that certain individuals who previously held high level technical\nand clinical positions with us misappropriated our intellectual property for the benefit of themselves and other companies. For example, on January 9, 2020, we\ninitiated litigation against Apple Inc. for infringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation and for ownership and correction of\ninventorship of a number of Apple Inc. patents that list one of our former employees as an inventor. For additional information on the current status of our\nlitigation with Apple Inc., please see Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our on-going and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the\nattention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be successful or\nadequate to protect our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in January 2024, we entered into a one year alternative fee agreement (Fee Agreement) with\nrespect to certain on-going legal fees and costs incurred by a vendor. The Fee Agreement imposes certain limits on a quarterly and annual basis for actual legal\nfees incurred by the vendor that are payable based on work performed related to litigation matters against Apple. If the vendor is successful in obtaining a\nfavorable judgement for us on any claim or counterclaim after exhaustion or dismissal of any appeals, or upon settlement resulting in monetary consideration to\nus, the vendor will be paid a success fee equal to three times the amount of the excess of the annual legal fee limit within 60 days after entry of a judgement or\nthe effective date of any settlement. Therefore, to the extent that we may be successful in our litigation against Apple, we could be required to make a payments\nto this vendor in excess of the actual amount of fees incurred in connection with our litigation against Apple.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current,\nupgraded or new healthcare products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market in the U.S. must first undergo premarket review pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act (FDCA) by receiving clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, receiving clearance through the de novo classification review process or\nobtaining approval of a premarket approval (PMA) application. Even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) may clear or approve our products only for limited indications for use. Additionally, the FDA may not grant 510(k) clearance on a timely\nbasis, if at all, for new products or new uses that we propose for Masimo SET® or licensed rainbow® technology.\nThe traditional FDA 510(k) clearance process for our medical devices has generally taken between four to nine months. However, our more recent experience\nand interactions with the FDA, along with information we have received from other medical device manufacturers, suggests that, in some cases, the FDA is\nrequiring applicants to provide additional or different information and data for 510(k) clearance than it had previously required, and that the FDA may not rely\non approaches that it had previously accepted to support 510(k) clearance. As a result, FDA 510(k) clearance can be delayed for our products in some cases.\nTo support our product applications to the FDA, we frequently are required to conduct clinical testing of our products. Such clinical testing must be conducted\nin compliance with FDA requirements pertaining to human research. Among other requirements, we must obtain informed consent from study subjects and\napproval by institutional review boards before such studies may begin. We must also comply with other FDA requirements such as monitoring, record-keeping,\nreporting and the submission of information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. In addition, if\nthe study involves a significant risk device, we are required to obtain the FDA’s approval of the study under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE).\nCompliance with these requirements can require significant time and resources. In addition, public health emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances\nmay disrupt the conduct of our clinical trials. If the FDA determines that we have not complied with such requirements, the FDA may refuse to consider the\ndata to support our applications or may initiate enforcement actions.\n74\nTable of Contents\nEven though 510(k) clearances have been obtained, if safety or effectiveness problems are identified with our products, we may need to initiate a recall of such\nproducts. Furthermore, our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be denied 510(k) clearance and be required to undergo the more\nburdensome PMA or de novo classification review processes. The process of obtaining a de novo classification or PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy\nand uncertain than the process for obtaining 510(k) clearance.\nDe novo classification review generally takes six months to one year from the time of submission of the de novo request, although it can take longer. Approval\nof a PMA generally takes one year from the time of submission of the PMA, but may be longer.\nSome of our products or product features may not be subject to the 510(k) process and/or other regulatory requirements in accordance with specific FDA\nguidance and policies, such as the FDA guidance related to mobile medical applications. In additions, some of our products or product features may not be\nsubject to device regulation pursuant to Section 520(o) of the FDCA, which excludes certain software functions from the statutory definition of a device. If the\nFDA changes its policies or concludes that our marketing of these products is not in accordance with its current policies and/or Section 520(o) of the FDCA,\nwe may be required to seek clearance or approval of these devices through the 510(k), de novo classification review or PMA processes.\nThe failure of our OEM partners to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our healthcare technologies could\nhave a negative impact on our revenue.\nOur healthcare OEM partners are required to obtain their own FDA clearances in the U.S. for most products incorporating our technologies. The FDA\nclearances we have obtained may not make it easier for our OEM partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies, or the FDA may\nnot grant clearances on a timely basis, if at all, for any future products incorporating our technologies that our OEM partners propose to market.\nWe are subject to on-going post-market regulation by regulatory authorities and if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements we could be\nsubject to enforcement actions, penalties or other harm to our business.\nOur healthcare products, along with the manufacturing processes, labeling and promotional activities for those products, are subject to continual review and\nperiodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Among other requirements, we and certain of our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA’s\nQuality System Regulation (QSR), which governs the methods and documentation of the design, control testing, production, component suppliers control,\nquality assurance, complaint handling, labeling control, packaging, storage and shipping of our healthcare products. The FDA enforces the QSR through\nannounced and unannounced inspections. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses.\nIn addition to the FDA, from time to time we are subject to inspections by the California Food and Drug Branch, international regulatory authorities and other\nsimilar governmental agencies. The standards used by these regulatory authorities are complex and may differ from those used by the FDA.\nFailure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies or failure to adequately\nrespond to any FDA Form 483 observations, any California Food and Drug Branch notices of violation or any similar reports could result in, among other\nthings, any of the following:\n• warning letters or untitled letters issued by the FDA;\n• fines, civil penalties, in rem forfeiture proceedings, injunctions, consent decrees and criminal prosecution;\n• import alerts;\n• unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n• delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products;\n• withdrawals or suspensions of clearance or approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n• product recalls or seizures;\n• orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n• interruptions of production or inability to export to certain foreign countries; and\n• operating restrictions.\n75\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, many of our healthcare and non-healthcare products are subject to various laws, regulations and legal requirements, including those governing\nconsumer protection, product import and export, hazardous materials usage and discharge, product related energy consumption, electrical safety, wireless\nemissions, e-commerce, packaging and recycling. Compliance with these requirements, which vary widely depending on jurisdiction, is time consuming and\nexpensive.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable legal requirements, it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory authorizations in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe currently market and intend to continue to market our products internationally. Outside of the U.S., we can generally market our healthcare products only if\nwe receive a marketing authorization (and/or meet certain pre-marketing requirements) and, in some cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory\nauthorities. The regulatory registration/licensing process varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional or different product testing than\nrequired to obtain FDA clearance. FDA clearance does not ensure new product registration/licensing by foreign regulatory authorities, and we may be unable to\nobtain foreign regulatory registration/licensing on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn addition, clearance by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure clearance by any other foreign regulatory authority or by the FDA. If we fail to\nreceive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, foreign regulatory requirements may change from time to time, which could adversely affect our ability to market new products, and/or continue\nto market existing products, internationally. Certain significant changes in the international regulatory landscape have recently taken place or will take place in\nthe near future. These include the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), which came into effect on May 26, 2021 and a regulatory\nregime in the UK effective since January 1, 2021 as a result of the UK’s exit from the EU (Brexit).\nModifications to our marketed medical devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing\nor to recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nWe have made modifications to our medical devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future. Any modification to a medical device\nthat is cleared by the FDA that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that could constitute a major change in its intended use would require a\nnew clearance or approval and certain modifications to devices cleared or approved by foreign regulatory authorities may also require a new clearance or\napproval.\nWe may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability\nto introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nFor device modifications that we conclude do not require a new regulatory clearance or approval, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the\nmodified devices if the government agency disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications. This could have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or\nserious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and other applicable laws, and may need to initiate voluntary or mandatory\ncorrective actions, such as the recall of our healthcare products.\nRegulatory agencies in many countries require us to report anytime our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a\nway that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. For example, under the FDA medical device reporting regulations, we are required to\nreport to the FDA any incident in which a product of ours may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product of ours\nmalfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing\nmedical devices on the market in the EU are legally required to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices produced or sold by the\nmanufacturer to the relevant authority in those jurisdictions where any such incident occurred.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of our commercialized healthcare products in the event of material\ndeficiencies or defects in, for example, design, labeling or manufacture. The FDA must find that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause\nserious adverse health consequences or death in order to require a recall. The standard for recalling deficient products may be different in foreign jurisdictions.\nManufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency is found in a device or they become aware of a safety issue involving\na marketed product. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures,\nmanufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nWe may initiate certain field actions, such as a product correction or removal of our products in the future. In addition, third- parties that commercialize\nproducts incorporating our technologies may initiate similar actions or product corrections. Any correction or removal initiated by us to reduce a health risk\nposed by our device, or to remedy a violation of the FDCA or other regulations caused by the device that may present a risk to health, must be reported to the\nFDA. If the FDA subsequently determines that a report was required for a correction or removal of our products that we did not believe required a report, we\ncould be subject to enforcement actions.\nIn addition, our non-healthcare products, including components we source from third parties, may be found to have design or manufacturing defects. Such\ndefects may result in additional costs for product modifications, voluntary or mandated product recalls or other liabilities resulting from product malfunctions.\nFor example, defects in our audio products may result in overheating or electrical shock, creating a risk of personal injury or property damage.\nAny recalls or corrections of our products or third-party products that incorporate our technologies, or enforcement actions would divert managerial and\nfinancial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given our dependence upon patient,\nphysician and consumer perceptions, any negative publicity associated with any recalls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nIn August 2023, we decided to conduct a voluntary recall of select Rad-G® products in connection with an issue that can result in an unintentional change in the\npower state of the device. On February 14, 2024, we initiated the voluntary recall. On February 21, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Department of\nJustice (DOJ) seeking documents and information related to our Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including information relating to complaints surrounding the\nproducts and our decision to recall the Rad-G®. Additionally, on March 25, 2024, we received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking documents\nand information related to customer returns of our Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including returns related our recall of select Rad-G® products in 2024. We are\ninvestigating the reasons for the delay between August 2023 and February 2024 when the recall was initiated. We are cooperating with the government and\nmay expend significant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoena and the investigative demand and any related\ninvestigation or any other future requests for information.\nPromotion of our healthcare products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\nObtaining 510(k) clearance permits us to promote our products for the uses cleared by the FDA. Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is\nknown as “off-label” use. Physicians may use our products off-label because the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician’s choice of treatment within the\npractice of medicine, but we may not promote our products “off-label”. While we may request additional cleared indications for our current products, the FDA\nmay deny those requests, require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any\ncleared product as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that our products were promoted for off-label use or that false, misleading or inadequately\nsubstantiated promotional claims have been made by us or our OEM partners, it could request that we or our OEM partners modify those promotional materials\nor it could take regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal\npenalties. While certain U.S. courts have held that truthful, non-misleading, off-label information is protected under the First Amendment under certain\ncircumstances, the FDA continues to take the position that off-label promotion is subject to enforcement action.\nIt is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our communications, including promotional or\ntraining materials, to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use. If not successfully defended, enforcement actions related to off-label promotion\ncould result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In any such event, our\nreputation could be damaged, adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to extensive fines and penalties.\n77\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products. If any of our claims are determined to be false, misleading or\ndeceptive, our products could be considered misbranded under the FDCA or in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. We could also face lawsuits\nfrom our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading.\nGovernment agencies in the EU, UK, Japan and other countries and jurisdictions have similar regulations on the advertising and promotion of medical devices.\nIf we fail to comply with any of these regulations, our reputation could be damaged, adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to\nextensive fines and penalties.\n*The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving. Many of the laws and\nregulations in this area are subject to uncertain interpretation, and our failure to comply could result in claims, penalties or increased costs or\notherwise harm our business.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Canada, China and many other jurisdictions where we\noffer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nA growing number of U.S. states have passed comprehensive privacy laws. These state laws govern the processing of residents’ personal information. Among\nmany new requirements, some of the state privacy laws expand consumers’ rights (such as opting out of the sale of personal information to third parties and\ntargeted advertising, restricting certain uses and disclosures of sensitive data, and requesting access, deletion, or correction of personal information). Some state\nlaws also minimize what data can be collected from consumers and how businesses may use and disclose it. These state privacy laws also require businesses to\nmake disclosures to consumers about data collection, use and sharing practices, and some state privacy laws require that businesses obtain consent from\nconsumers for certain uses and disclosures of their sensitive data. In addition, some of these state privacy laws, along with other standalone state health privacy\nlaws, subject certain health-related information to additional safeguards and disclosures and some specifically regulate consumer health data, such as the\nWashington My Health My Data Act and the Nevada health data privacy law that each went into effect this year. There is significant uncertainty regarding how\nregulators will interpret and enforce this patchwork of new laws, particularly to the extent there are inconsistencies or differences in their requirements. In\naddition, in states that allow for a private right of action to enforce these laws, we are subjected to a higher risk of individual and class action lawsuits.\nMoreover, we have observed an increase in plaintiffs seeking to apply older privacy laws such as the Video Privacy Protection Act and the California Invasion\nof Privacy Act to newer technologies to allege claims of invasion of privacy rights.\nWe continue to be subject to federal privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), in certain circumstances,\nin connection with any personal health information or medical information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the operation of our\nbusiness. Further, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which, in recent years, has increased its scrutiny of the practices of\nentities that collect certain health-related information from consumers. Moreover, comprehensive federal data privacy legislation has been proposed and, if\npassed, would further change the privacy and data security compliance landscape. In addition, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to\ndisclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience and to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk\nmanagement, strategy and governance.\nAll 50 U.S. states have data breach notification laws that, if violated, could result in penalties, fines and litigation. In addition, many states have implemented\nor are in the process of implementing related legislation, including state-specific biometric privacy laws that have resulted in individual and class-action\nlawsuits against businesses. The full impact of these laws on our business is yet to be determined, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as\nadditional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers. In addition, Colorado has enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate certain\nartificial intelligence systems that will subject businesses that develop and deploy these systems to increased compliance obligations, and a number of other\nstates have proposed legislation to regulate the use of artificial intelligence.\nInternationally, the European Data Protection Board continues to release guidelines for industries and impose fines related to the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), some of which have been very significant. To improve coordination among EU supervisory authorities, the European Commission has\nproposed a new regulation that would help to streamline enforcement of the GDPR in cross-border cases. Meanwhile, there continues to be persistent\nuncertainty relating to the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S., or other non-adequate countries, following the Schrems II decision. On July 10,\n2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). The decision, which took effect on the day of\nits adoption, concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EEA to companies certified to the\nDPF. However, it remains too soon to tell how the future of Privacy Shield 2.0 will evolve and what impact it will have on our international activities. At least\none challenge to the DPF is pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n78\nTable of Contents\nFurther, Brexit has led and could also lead to legislative and regulatory changes that may increase our compliance costs. As of January 1, 2021 and the expiry\nof transitional arrangements agreed to between the UK and the EU, data processing in the UK is governed by a UK version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR\nand the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement\nactions for certain violations. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an Adequacy Decision for the UK, allowing for the relatively free\nexchange of personal information between the EU and the UK, (as the UK correspondingly allows transfers back to the EU). However, the European\nCommission may suspend the Adequacy Decision if it considers that the UK no longer provides for an adequate level of data protection. Following the UK\nnational elections in July 2024, the new UK Labour Government has expressed its intention to introduce into Parliament two pieces of legislation to regulate\nthe use of digital IDs and to strengthen the UK’s cyber defenses, but has yet to signal an intention to materially change the UK’s data protection framework.\nThe government also stated an intention to more heavily regulate the development of artificial intelligence but referenced no specific legislation.\nOther international jurisdictions, including Canada, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the UAE, Singapore, South Korea, Mexico, Australia, Argentina,\nIndia and Brazil, among others, have also implemented, or are in the process of implementing laws relating to data privacy and protection that are all already in\neffect or are anticipated to go into effect soon, or are amending existing laws. In addition, several jurisdictions such as South Korea have shown increased\nenforcement of their existing data privacy and security laws. Although we believe that we are complying with the GDPR and similar laws, these laws are still\nrelatively new. Therefore, as international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement\ninformation become available, we may incur additional costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements.\nWe may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws. Violations of these laws, or allegations of\nsuch violations, could subject us to criminal or civil, monetary or and non-monetary penalties, disrupt our operations, involve significant management\ndistraction, negatively impact our brand image, subject us to class action lawsuits and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties\nif we are unable to fully comply with these laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include, but are not limited to:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe,\nkickback or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare\nprogram (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n• the federal False Claims Act and other federal laws which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented,\nclaims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, other government payers or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n• the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and\ntransfers of value to certain healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals in the U.S.; and\n• state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by\ngovernmental programs and non-governmental third-party payers, including commercial insurers.\nIf we are found to have violated any such laws or other similar governmental regulations, including their foreign counterparts, that are directly or indirectly\napplicable to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties could adversely affect our\nability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against such action,\ncould cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\n79\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n*We may experience conflicts of interest with Willow with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\nPrior to our initial public offering in August 2007, our stockholders owned 99% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Willow, and we believe that a\nnumber of our stockholders, including certain of our directors, executive officers, including our former Chairman and CEO, Mr. Kiani, continue to own shares\nof Willow stock. Mr. Kiani is also the Chairman and CEO of Willow. For additional information with respect to our leadership, please see “Executive\nLeadership and Board Transitions” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Due to the interrelated nature of Willow with us, conflicts of\ninterest may arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Willow, potential acquisitions of businesses or products, the\ndevelopment and ownership of technologies and products, the sale of products, markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of\nour stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of Willow. In addition, we and Willow may disagree regarding the interpretation of\ncertain terms in the Cross-Licensing Agreement. We cannot guarantee that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor, or that, with respect to our\ntransactions with Willow, we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with another third-party.\nWe will be required to assign to Willow and pay Willow for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring\nof non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®.\nUnder the Cross-Licensing Agreement, if we develop certain products or technologies that relate to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters,\nincluding improvements to Masimo SET® for the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, we would be required to assign these developments to\nWillow and then license the technology back from Willow in consideration for upfront payments and royalty obligations to Willow. Therefore, these products\nand technologies would be deemed to have been developed or improved exclusively by Willow.\nIn addition, we will not be reimbursed by Willow for our expenses relating to the development or improvement of any such products or technologies, which\nexpenses may be significant. As a result of these terms, we may not generate any revenue from the further development of certain products and technologies for\nthe monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIn the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Willow grants a license to rainbow® technology to a third-party, our\nbusiness would be adversely affected.\nWillow owns all of the proprietary rights to certain rainbow® technology developed with our proprietary Masimo SET® for products intended to be used in the\n“Willow Market”, and all rights to any non-vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement. In\naddition, Willow has the right to terminate the Cross-Licensing Agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow® technology to third-parties if we breach certain\nterms of the agreement, including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or\nmarket products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology. If we lose our exclusive license to rainbow® technology, we would lose the ability to prevent\nothers from making, using, selling or importing products using rainbow® technology in our market. As a result, we would likely be subject to increased\ncompetition within our market, and Willow or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow® technology from Willow would be able to offer related products.\nWe may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology cost-effectively or successfully.\nAs a result of the royalties that we must pay to Willow, it is generally more expensive for us to make products that incorporate licensed rainbow® technology\nthan products that do not include licensed rainbow® technology.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to sell products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology at a price the market is willing to accept. If we cannot\ncommercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology successfully, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from these products to\nbe profitable, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n80\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to\ncustomers.\nWe depend on certain sole or limited source suppliers for certain key materials and components, including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital\nconverter chips for certain products. These suppliers are located around the world, and the production and shipment of such materials and components may be\nconstrained globally due to freight carrier delays and other disruptions to the supply chain. We may experience manufacturing problems related to these\nsuppliers and other outside sources if such suppliers fail to develop, manufacture or ship products and components to us on a timely basis, or provide us with\nproducts and components that do not meet our quality standards and required quantities. We previously experienced supply constraints with regard to certain\ndigital signal processor chips and other components during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected our sales during 2022. In addition, from time to time there\nhave been industry-wide shortages of certain components that we use in certain products. We may also experience price increases for materials, components\nand shipping with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins.\nIf any of these problems occur, we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these products and components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us,\nwhich could harm our ability to manufacture our own products and components profitably or on time.\n*Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions or separations of businesses and strategic investments or joint ventures, could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses and their employees successfully into our existing\noperations or achieve the desired results of our initiatives.\nWe have acquired several businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. For example, on April 11, 2022, we completed\nour acquisition of Sound United. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, on April 11, 2022, we entered into a Credit Facility to partially fund the\nacquisition. Future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or reduce our earnings per\nshare or other financial metrics. Even if we complete acquisitions, there are many factors that could affect whether such acquisition, including our acquisition\nof Sound United, will be beneficial to our business, including, without limitation:\n• payment of above-market prices for acquisitions and higher than anticipated acquisition costs;\n• issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition price or a need to issue stock options or other equity-based compensation to newly-hired employees of\ntarget companies, resulting in dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders;\n• reduced profitability if an acquisition is not accretive to our business over either the short-term or the long-term;\n• difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products and other assets into our existing business;\n• delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, products or other assets;\n• regulatory challenges and becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements;\n• cybersecurity and compliance-related issues;\n• diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n• limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n• unanticipated issues dealing with unfamiliar suppliers, service providers or other collaborators of the acquired company;\n• higher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n• write-downs or impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquired company;\n• difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions;\n• negative impacts on our relationships with our employees, clients, customers or collaborators;\n• intellectual property and other litigation, other claims or liabilities in connection with the acquisition; and\n• changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue, gross profit margin or operating expense profile.\n81\nTable of Contents\nFurther, our ability to benefit from future acquisitions and/or external strategic investments, joint ventures or any other business separation depends on our\nability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate acceptable terms, evaluate prospective opportunities and bring acquired technologies and/or products to\nmarket at acceptable margins and operating expense levels. On September 25, 2024, we announced that our Board remains committed to the previously\nannounced review of alternatives for both the consumer audio and consumer healthcare businesses, and that our Board has engaged Centerview Partners and\nMorgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a legal advisor. For more information regarding the risks associated with the potential\nseparation of any of our consumer businesses, see the risk factor below with the heading “The potential separation of any of our consumer businesses is subject\nto various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated, if at all, and, if completed, may not achieve the intended\nbenefits.”\nWe may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, product liabilities or other\nundisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition or investment, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties, other liabilities or\nasset impairments. In addition, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other external investment as rapidly as expected, or at all,\ninvestors or analysts may downgrade our stock.\nWe also expect to continue to carry out internal strategic initiatives that we believe are necessary to grow our revenues and expand our business, both in the\nU.S. and abroad. For example, we have continued to invest in international expansion programs designed to increase our worldwide presence and take\nadvantage of market expansion opportunities around the world. Although we believe our investments in these initiatives continue to be in the long-term best\ninterests of Masimo and our stockholders, there are no assurances that such initiatives will yield favorable results for us. Accordingly, if these initiatives are not\nsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected\npenalties, liabilities or asset impairments in connection with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n*Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or\ngenerate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation or financial results.\nIn connection with the Sound United acquisition, we have expanded our business and product strategy to additionally focus on non-healthcare consumer\nproducts to integrate with our successful medical technology businesses. Further, we may introduce certain changes to our existing healthcare products or\nintroduce new and unproven products. Prior to the Sound United acquisition, we did not have significant experience with consumer hardware products, and\nSound United does not have experience with healthcare products, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and\ntechnologies and integrate them with our existing products and platforms. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term strategic initiative that\nwill involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in medical technology and consumer products, and collaboration with\nother companies, developers, partners and other participants. However, our non-healthcare business may not develop in accordance with our vision and\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products or services we build for our consumer businesses may be uncertain. We may be unsuccessful in our\nresearch and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the consumer products business. Our new\nstrategic efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. In addition, as our non-healthcare business continues to\nevolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and international jurisdictions, which we were not previously affected by, including\nin the areas of privacy, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management\ntime and attention, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the expansion of our non-healthcare business could be significantly impacted by our recently\nannounced evaluation of the separation of our consumer businesses (see the risk factor below with the heading “The potential separation of any of our\nconsumer businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated, if at all, and, if completed,\nmay not achieve the intended benefits” for more information regarding the risks associated with the potential separation of our consumer businesses). As a\nresult of these or other factors, our non-healthcare expansion and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n82\nTable of Contents\nOur Credit Facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Facility contains various affirmative covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including:\n• incurring specified types of additional indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional debt or equity financing at the\ntime needed or that such financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us (including guarantees or other contingent obligations);\n• paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions in respect of our common stock or making other restricted payments, subject to specified\nexceptions;\n• making specified investments (including loans and advances);\n• selling or transferring certain assets;\n• creating certain liens;\n• consolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n• entering into certain transactions with any of our affiliates.\nIn addition, under our Credit Facility, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nOur ability to meet those financial ratios and affirmative and negative covenants could be affected by events beyond our control and, therefore, we cannot be\nassured that we will be able to continue to satisfy these requirements. A breach of any of these ratios or covenants could result in a default under our Credit\nFacility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility immediately due and\npayable, terminate all commitments to extend further credit and pursue legal remedies for recovery, all of which could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition. See Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for additional information on our Credit Facility.\nFurther, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Sound United acquisition, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nEven if we achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our\nindebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial, and business conditions as well as other factors\naffecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have incurred impairment charges for other intangible assets, and may incur further impairment charges in the future, which would negatively\nimpact our operating results.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we experienced continued declines in our stock price and certain worsening macro-economic market conditions, including\ncontinued slowing in demand for consumer audio products, which contributed to a significant decline in our market capitalization. Based on these factors, we\ndetermined that there was a triggering event for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which required an interim impairment assessment. Accordingly,\nwe performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and a recoverability test for other long-lived assets with finite lives. This\nquantitative assessment indicated that the carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $7.0\nmillion. No impairment of goodwill was identified, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of September 30, 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, although we experienced a recovery in our stock price and stabilization in our market capitalization, we also experienced\ncontinued softening in customer demand for our non-healthcare core audio products and additional supply chain inefficiencies. Based on these factors and\nfurther quantitative assessment, we determined the carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately\n$3.0 million.\nWe review goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of the year or more\nfrequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In the event we are required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to our\ngoodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives in the future, such a non-cash charge could have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated statements of operations and balance sheets in the reporting period in which we record the charge.\n83\nTable of Contents\nWe may need additional capital and failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business\nand develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\nWe anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facility, and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide\nadequate resources to fund on-going operating and capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12\nmonths. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments. If our existing resources are\ninsufficient to satisfy cash requirements, we may seek to obtain one or more additional credit facilities, sell equity or debt securities or pursue other forms of\nfinancing. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants\nthat could potentially restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, could result in dilution to\nstockholders. In addition, actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions,\ntransactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any\nevents of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could increase our costs of\nborrowing.\nOur ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including investors’ perception of, and demand for, our\nsecurities, conditions in the capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds, our future results of operations and financial condition, and general economic,\nmacro-economic, political and geopolitical conditions. In addition, even if debt financing is available, the cost of additional financing may be significantly\nhigher than those provided for in our current Credit Facility. Moreover, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or at\ntimes when we require it, each of which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business and operations and develop or enhance our products and\nofferings to respond to market demand or competitive or other business challenges.\n*The potential separation of any of our consumer businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms\ncurrently contemplated, if at all, and, if completed, may not achieve the intended benefits.\nOn September 25, 2024, we announced that our Board remains committed to the previously announced review of alternatives for both the consumer audio and\nconsumer healthcare businesses, and that our Board has engaged Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a\nlegal advisor.\nAny proposed separation is expected to require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees. Completion of any proposed\nseparation and its timing will be subject to a number of factors and conditions, including the finalization of the structure of any proposed separation, approval\nby our Board, and the satisfaction of any agreed or required conditions, among other things. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete any\nproposed separation on a specified timeline or at all. These risks with respect to any proposed separation could negatively affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. The execution of the proposed separation has required and may continue to require significant time and attention from our\nsenior management and employees, which could cause disruption in business processes and adversely affect our financial results and our results of operations,\nand our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty regarding the future state of our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nConcentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from\ninfluencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of September 28, 2024, our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 18.4% of our\noutstanding stock. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Delaware law, these stockholders may be able to exercise significant\ninfluence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some\ncontrol over our management and policies in their roles as stockholders. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours. For\nexample, these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests.\nThe concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us, or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control\nof us, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock.\nIn addition, these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office or support or reject other\nmanagement and Board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant\nfinancing transactions.\n84\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately plan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet\nour publicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results.\nFrom time to time, we release earnings guidance or other financial guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our\nfuture performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. Our guidance includes forward-looking statements based on\nprojections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are based on information known when they\nare issued, and, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and\ncontingencies relating to our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business\ndecisions, some of which will change. Some of those key assumptions include broader macro-economic conditions and the resulting impact of these factors on\nfuture consumer spending patterns and our business. These assumptions are inherently difficult to predict, particularly in the long term. Additionally, forecasted\nfinancial and operating results may differ materially from actual results, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and stock price. For\nexample, if certain of our assumptions or estimates prove to be wrong, including any of the economic trends and developments affecting our business discussed\nin Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report, either of\nwhich could negatively impact our stock price and expose us to potential stockholder litigation.\nWe generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended\nto imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of\nour business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or estimates or\nthat consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions,\ngeopolitical events, rising inflation, and rising interest rates, potential recessionary factors, and foreign exchange rate volatility, which could adversely affect\nour business and future operating results. We use the reports and models of economic experts in making assumptions relating to consumer discretionary\nspending and predictions as to timing and pace of any future economic impacts. If these models are incorrect or incomplete, or if we fail to accurately predict\nthe full impact of certain factors, such as macro-economic factors, the guidance and other forward-looking statements we provide may also be incorrect or\nincomplete. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating\nresults fails to meet expectations of analysts, investors, or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline. Guidance is necessarily\nspeculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary\nsignificantly from actual results. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our\ncommon stock.\n*Our corporate documents, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent\nattempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may\nconsider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to 5.0 million shares of “blank check” preferred stock. As a\nresult, without further stockholder approval, our Board has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock,\nincluding pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, such as those underlying the Rights Agreement we previously adopted on September 9, 2022, which we\nterminated in accordance with the terms of the Amendment to the Rights Agreement we entered into effective as of March 22, 2023. However, we may\nimplement a new stockholder rights plan in the future, which may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control by, among other things,\nmaking it uneconomical for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. With such rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult\nfor a third-party to acquire us.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation previously provided for a staggered Board, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with one-third of the\ndirectors coming up for reelection each year. However, at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders held on June 26, 2023, our stockholders approved an\namendment to our certificate of incorporation, pursuant to which we will phase-in the declassification of our Board over four years, whereby all members of\nour Board that are elected after our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders would be elected for annual terms. Accordingly, the three-year term for the Class I\ndirectors elected at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders will expire at our 2026 annual meeting of stockholders, the three-year term for the Class II\ndirectors elected at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders expired as originally scheduled at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders and the three-year\nterm for the Class III directors elected at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders will expire as originally scheduled at our 2025 annual meeting of\nstockholders. The implementation of the declassification of our Board commenced at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. Directors elected at our 2024\nannual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter will be elected to serve a one-year term. Beginning with our 2026 annual\nmeeting of stockholders, all directors would stand for annual elections.\n85\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL). Under these provisions, if anyone\nbecomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could\ndiscourage a third-party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. For purposes of these provisions, an “interested\nstockholder” generally means someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding\nvoting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in the DGCL.\n*Recent changes to our senior leadership and our Board could create uncertainties and adversely impact our business.\nOur senior leadership and our Board have experienced personnel turnover. See “Executive Leadership and Board Transitions” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for additional information on our leadership. Changes in our executive leadership team and our Board may be disruptive to, or cause\nuncertainty in, our business and could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. The prolonged absence of a\npermanent CEO could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Loss of key personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge could\ncreate continuity risks and challenges to our ability to execute our business and strategy, including potentially disrupting our operations and relationships with\nemployees, suppliers and partners. Such loss of, and the failure to attract and retain, qualified key personnel could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and the price of our common stock.\nExclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or\nstockholders to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or as\nto which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine. However, this choice of forum provision does not apply to (a) actions in which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware concludes that an\nindispensable party is not subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts, or (b) actions in which a federal court has assumed exclusive jurisdiction to a\nproceeding. This choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or\nthe Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nExchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability\ncreated by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This choice of forum provision may limit a\nstockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders,\nwhich may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees or stockholders.\nFurthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal\nproceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum\nprovision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our periodic financial results and may not maintain our current levels of profitability in the future.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Many of the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. and\nseveral of the members of the EU, have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors. In\naddition, continuing uncertainty in the U.S. economy may result in continued inflationary pressures globally and in the U.S. in particular, which may contribute\nto future interest rate volatility.\nOur business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these uncertain economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic\nconditions, which may potentially impair our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all; changes in consumer spending during a\nrecession; and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions.\n86\nTable of Contents\nWe are also unable to predict how changing global economic conditions or potential global health concerns will affect our critical customers, suppliers and\ndistributors. Any negative impact of such matters on our critical customers, suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of\noperations or financial condition. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels and are relatively fixed in the short-\nterm.\nAs a result, if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that\nperiod. Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period.\nIn addition, the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties\nand assumptions. Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments, the impact of which could significantly affect our\nresults of operations. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent accounting changes related to our embedded leases within certain deferred equipment agreements have also resulted in the acceleration of the timing\nrelated to our recognition of revenue and expenses associated with certain equipment provided to healthcare customers at no up-front charge. Since we cannot\ncontrol the timing of when our customers will request us to deliver such equipment, our revenue and costs with respect to leased equipment could vary\nsubstantially in any given quarter or year, which could further increase quarterly or annual fluctuations within our financial results.\nDue to these and other factors, you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. If our operating results fail to\nmeet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\n*A dispute with our former Chairman and CEO Mr. Kiani with respect to his Amended Employment Agreement could be costly and adversely affect\nour business.\nOn September 19, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered the September 19 Notice to our Board stating his decision to resign from his position as our CEO. On September\n23, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to our Board further describing his decision to resign (the September 23 Notice), and, on September 25, 2024, Mr.\nKiani delivered an amended notification to our Board stating his decision to resign (the September 25 Notice, and, together with the September 19 Notice and\nthe September 23 Notice, the Notice).\nThe Notice states that Mr. Kiani’s resignation is for “Good Reason” (as such term defined in Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement)) and that the basis\nfor his resignation for “Good Reason” is the diminution of his “responsibilities, duties and authority as the Chairman of the Board and CEO” as defined in\nSections 2 and 7.4 of his Amended Employment Agreement.\nThe September 19 Notice states that Mr. Kiani expects us to pay him “the full amount of the benefits” that he is entitled to receive under the Amended\nEmployment Agreement.\nAdditionally, on September 19, 2024, Mr. Kiani filed a claim in California Superior Court relating to his Amended Employment Agreement seeking, among\nother things, declaratory relief that he had validly terminated his employment for “Good Reason” and that he was entitled to certain benefits provided in the\nAmended Employment Agreement upon a termination for “Good Reason”. We are evaluating the claim against us. We believe we have good and substantial\ndefenses to the claim, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these efforts.\nOn October 24, 2024, we commenced litigation against Mr. Kiani in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, alleging that certain provisions in the\nAmended Employment Agreement, including provisions entitling Mr. Kiani to receive substantial benefits upon his removal as the Chairman or CEO of the\nCompany or termination for Good Reason (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement), are invalid, inequitable, and amount to a waste of corporate\nassets.\nOn October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment, effective October 24, 2024.\nAny dispute with Mr. Kiani concerning his Amended Employment Agreement could be costly and become a distraction to our management and employees and\nadversely affect our business. Any costs incurred to resolve any dispute arising from the Amended Employment Agreement and any severance or other\ncompensation we become obligated, or otherwise determine, to pay to Mr. Kiani, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n87\nTable of Contents\n*If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel, we may not be able to manage our\noperations or meet our growth objectives.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management. We are also heavily dependent on our engineers and field sales team, including sales representatives and\nclinical specialists. We do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies with respect to any of our key personnel.\nWe believe certain of our competitors with greater financial resources than us have targeted our key personnel for recruitment and will likely continue to do so\nin the future. To the extent that key personnel depart, we may be required to bring on new hires that require training and take time before they achieve full\nproductivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals.\nIn general, our key personnel may terminate their employment at any time and for any reason without notice, unless the individual is a participant in our 2007\nSeverance Protection Plan, in which case the individual has agreed to provide us with six months’ notice if such individual decides to voluntarily resign.\nIn addition, regulation or legislation impacting the workforce, such as the rule published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) purporting to generally\nprevent employers from entering into non-competition agreements with employees and require employers to rescind existing non-competition agreements, may\nlead to increased uncertainty in hiring and competition for talent. On July 3, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted a motion to\nstay and preliminarily enjoin the effective date of the FTC’s final rule banning non-competition restrictions. By this order, the September 4, 2024, effective date\nof the FTC’s non-compete ban is stayed, and the FTC is enjoined from implementing or enforcing the ban. However, as of now, the order applies only to the\nnamed plaintiffs in the Texas pending litigation, and it is uncertain whether the stay may apply to us.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by\nfinancial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition\nand results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties\nor other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other\nsimilar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was\nclosed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.\nSimilarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a statement by the Department of the\nTreasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure,\nincluding funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB,\nSignature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. Although\nwe are not a borrower or party to any such instruments with SVB, Signature or any other financial institution currently in receivership, if any of our lenders or\ncounterparties to any such instruments were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, counterparties to SVB credit\nagreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB\nand uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-\n2010 financial crisis.\nAlthough we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts\nadequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial\ninstitutions with which we have credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could\ninclude, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity\nagreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the\nprospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which\nwe have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally.\nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected\nbusiness operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n88\nTable of Contents\n• delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets;\n• loss of access to revolving existing credit facilities or other working capital sources and/or the inability to refund, roll over or extend the maturity of, or\nenter into new credit facilities or other working capital resources;\n• potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require us to maintain letters or credit or other credit support arrangements;\n• potential or actual breach of financial covenants in our credit agreements or credit arrangements;\n• potential or actual cross-defaults in other credit agreements, credit arrangements or operating or financing agreements; or\n• termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements.\nAny decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating\nexpenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal\nor state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not\ndescribed above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results\nof operations.\nIn addition, any further deterioration in the macro-economic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our customers or\nsuppliers, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, a customer may fail to make payments when due, default under their agreements with us, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, or a\nsupplier may determine that it will no longer deal with us as a customer. In addition, a customer or supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity\nor other risks that are described above as factors that could result in material adverse impacts on our company, including but not limited to delayed access or\nloss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. Any customer or\nsupplier bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any customer to make payments when due, or any breach or default by a customer or supplier, or the loss of\nany significant supplier relationships, could result in material losses to our company and may have material adverse impacts on our business.\nA regional or global recession and other negative macro-economic trends could adversely affect our consumer businesses.\nOur consumer products are generally considered non-essential, discretionary products. As such, many of these products can be especially sensitive to general\ndownturns in the economy. Negative macro-economic conditions, such as high inflation, recession, changes to monetary policy, increasing interest rates and\ndecreasing consumer confidence can adversely impact demand for these products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nFuture changes in accounting pronouncements and tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, could have a significant impact on our reported results, and\nmay affect our historical reporting of previous transactions.\nNew accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, and evolving interpretations thereof, have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Future changes\nmade by new accounting standards may apply prospectively or retrospectively, depending on the method of adoption, and may recast previously reported\nresults. For additional information related to the impact of new accounting pronouncements, please see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”,\nto our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, future changes to the U.S. tax code and its regulations could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and the implementation of these\nchanges could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar Two) that has\nbeen agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on how Pillar Two\nrules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. A number of countries have utilized the administrative guidance as a starting\npoint for legislation that is effective January 1, 2024. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative\nadoption by individual countries.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOur retirement and post-retirement pension benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe sponsor several defined benefit plans with post-retirement benefits to certain employees in certain international markets. These defined benefit plans are\nfunded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates,\ninvestment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and post-retirement benefit\nobligations, causing volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future\nfunding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled,\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, regulatory proceedings or other disputes. In general, claims made by or against us in disputes and\nother legal or regulatory proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against, requiring us to expend significant resources and divert\nthe efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations. These potential claims may include, but are not limited to\npersonal injury and class action lawsuits, intellectual property claims and regulatory investigations relating to the advertising and promotional claims about our\nproducts and employee claims against us based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. In addition, we may become\nsubject to claims against companies we acquire based on circumstances arising prior to the acquisition, and the sellers of the acquired company may have no\nobligation to reimburse us for any resulting damages or expenses.\nDue to the complexity of our business and the variety of risks that we face, our internal risk mitigation policies and procedures may not always be sufficient to\nallow us to identify issues and take corrective action before a claim, lawsuit or regulatory action is initiated against us. Failure to detect and remediate issues at\nan early stage could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in increased liability in any ensuing proceeding.\nAny litigation, proceedings or dispute, even those without merit, may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit\nthe future performance of our operations. Any adverse determination against us in these proceedings, or even the allegations contained in the claims, regardless\nof whether they are ultimately found to be without merit, may also result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to government immigration regulations may materially affect our workforce and limit our supply of qualified professionals, or increase our\ncost of securing workers.\nWe recruit professionals on a global basis and must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Some of our\nemployees are working under Masimo-sponsored temporary work visas, including H1-B visas. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B temporary work\npermit petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the current U.S. immigration visa program may be significantly\noverhauled, and the number of H1-B visas available, as well as the process to obtain them, may be subject to significant change. Any resulting changes to this\nvisa program could impact our ability to recruit, hire and retain qualified skilled personnel. If we are unable to obtain work visas in sufficient quantities or at a\nsufficient rate for a significant period of time, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe risks inherent in operating internationally, including the purchase, sale and shipment of our components and products across international\nborders, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently derive approximately 43% of our net sales from international operations. In addition, we purchase a portion of our raw materials and components\nfrom international sources. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of materials and components from\ninternational sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, including those related to duties, tariffs and conflict minerals.\nCompliance with such regulations is costly and we could be exposed to potentially significant penalties, fines and interest if we are found not to be in\ncompliance with such regulations. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but\nare not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges,\nseizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. We have historically engaged in\ntransactions with entities related to or located in countries subject to certain U.S. export restrictions. For example, we have had sales of medical products\ndestined for Iran. Although these activities have not been financially material to our business, financial condition or results of operations, and were undertaken\nin accordance with general licenses authorizing such activities issued by the U.S.\n90\nTable of Contents\nTreasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, we may not be successful in ensuring compliance with limitations or restrictions on business in Iran or\nany other countries subject to economic sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. Additionally, the export of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in\nthe U.S. to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political\ndynamics, outside our control. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping,\nmanufacturing and sales activities.\nIn addition, changes in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade\nagreements, could negatively impact our business. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries,\nwhich has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Changes or uncertainty in tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or\nother countries in response could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able\nto sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more\ndetailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These\nrisks include, but are not limited to:\n• the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n• the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n• a shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n• the loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge, or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets;\n• changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n• the imposition of new trade restrictions;\n• the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n• compliance with foreign tax laws, regulations and requirements;\n• pricing pressure;\n• changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n• political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the global impact\nof restrictions and sanctions imposed on Russia and the Israel-Palestine-Iran war;\n• financial and civil unrest worldwide;\n• outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or other local or global health issues;\n• the inability to collect amounts paid by foreign government customers to our appointed foreign agents;\n• longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and different collection remedies with respect to receivables; and\n• difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights.\nA trade war, trade barriers or other governmental actions related to tariffs, international trade agreements, import or export restrictions or other trade policies\ncould adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, therefore, adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries\nfrom promising or making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining an advantage to secure or retain business. Because of the\npredominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental\nentities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. We have adopted policies and practices that help us ensure compliance with these anti-bribery laws.\nHowever, such policies and practice may require us to invest in additional monitoring resources or forgo certain business opportunities in order to ensure global\ncompliance with these laws. Additionally, any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on\nour ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\n91\nTable of Contents\nAny material decrease in our international sales would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property protection laws in foreign countries differ substantially from those in the U.S. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection in\nforeign countries, or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more\neffectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors. As a result, events that result in global\neconomic uncertainty could significantly affect our results of operations in the form of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and potential\ndevaluation of the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nWhile a majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, some of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than\nthe U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on the approximation of the exchange rates applied\nduring a respective period. Similarly, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact business in their respective country’s local currency, which is also their\nfunctional currency. In addition, certain production costs related to our manufacturing operations are denominated in local currency. As a result, expenses of\nthese foreign subsidiaries and certain production costs, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a\nrespective period.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as cash deposits. When\nconverted to U.S. Dollars, these receivables, payables and cash deposits can vary depending on the monthly exchange rates at the end of the period. In addition,\ncertain intercompany transactions may give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses based on the currency underlying such\nintercompany transactions. Accordingly, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at the\nbalance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average monthly exchange\nrates applicable during the period. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose\nfunctional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our foreign currency exchange rate risk, please see “Quantitative\nand Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe currently manufacture our products at a limited number of locations and any disruption to, expansion of, or changes in trade programs related to\nsuch manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia that may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. Earthquakes are of particular\nsignificance since some of our facilities are located in earthquake-prone areas. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power\nloss, attacks from extremist or terrorist organizations, epidemics, communication failures, fire, floods, hurricanes and similar events. Our facilities and the\nmanufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial time to repair if significant damage were to\nresult from any of these occurrences.\nIf one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a natural or man-made disaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers if we could not\nshift production to our other manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties\nmay not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If the lease for any of our\nleased facilities is terminated, we are unable to renew any of our leases or we are otherwise forced to seek alternative facilities, or if we voluntarily expand one\nor more of our manufacturing operations to new locations, we may incur additional transition costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products\nuntil the new facilities are available and operating. Additionally, we have occasionally experienced seasonality and other shortages among our manufacturing\nworkforce, and if we continue to experience such seasonality or other\n92\nTable of Contents\nworkforce shortages or otherwise have issues retaining employees or contractors at our manufacturing facilities, we may not be able to meet our customers’\ndemands.\nOur global manufacturing and distribution are dependent upon our manufacturing facilities in multiple countries, and the expedient importation of raw\nmaterials and exportation of finished goods between these facilities. Undue delays and/or closures of cross-border transit facilities, or any restrictions by local\ngovernments related to the movement of goods to or from the U.S., may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders and supply our customers, as well as\nadversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, delays and closures of shipping ports, or ports of entry into and out of the U.S., including as a result of labor strikes or shortages, may delay our\nability to fulfill order and supply of our non-healthcare consumer products, which could also adversely impact our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nOur manufacturing facilities in Mexico are authorized to operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (IMMEX) program. The IMMEX program allows us to\nimport certain items from the U.S. into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated timeframe.\nMaquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the IMMEX\nprogram and other local regulations. Failure to comply with the IMMEX program regulations, including any changes thereto, could increase our manufacturing\ncosts and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n*If we do not accurately forecast customer demand, we may hold suboptimal inventory levels that could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to meet the demand of our customers, our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could reduce our\nrevenue and gross profit margin. Conversely, if product demand decreases, we may be unable to timely adjust our manufacturing cost structure, resulting in\nexcess capacity, which would lower gross product margins. Similarly, if we are unable to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to record charges\nrelated to excess or obsolete inventory, which would also lower our gross margin. Each of our business segments is individually influenced by many factors,\nincluding but not limited to: new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, holiday schedules, hospital census, the timing of the influenza season,\nholiday seasons, consumer pressures, inflationary and recessionary pressures, consumer demand and preferences, and competitors’ marketing promotions and\nsales incentives; among many other factors.\nIn addition, we may experience seasonal demand for our products and demand for such products could decrease significantly during a recession. For example,\nhealthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have generally historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality\nof the U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer elective procedures utilizing our healthcare products.\nThe flu season concluded abnormally early and faded quickly in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in reduced inpatient census. In addition, some customers\nheld elevated sensor inventory levels due to discounting in prior quarters, which was discontinued during the second quarter. Healthcare facilities and hospitals\nexperienced fewer flu-related hospitalizations and medical office visits, which decreased consumption of our single-patient use sensors and consumables. The\ncorresponding delays in reordering for our single-patient use sensors and consumables had an adverse impact on our healthcare revenue for the second half of\n2023. Similarly, our non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year generally produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other\nquarters of our fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. Our promotional discounting activity may\nnegatively impact our gross margin. Any shortfalls in expected revenue due to a mismatch in supply of and demand for our products, could cause our operating\nresults to suffer significantly, and seasonal or similar variances may also result in fluctuations in our revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and investors’ confidence in us could be adversely affected.\nWe are required to prepare and disclose certain information under the Exchange Act, in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety, and\nour failure to do so could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expose us to lawsuits and\nrestrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to conclude on an on-going basis that we have effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, any material weakness in our internal control environment could result\nin the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, negatively impact the trading price of our\nstock, and adversely affect investors’ confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.\n93\nTable of Contents\nChanging laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and\noperating results.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure have created, and will create, additional compliance\nrequirements for us. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities\nmore difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other\nbusiness concerns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nTo maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we have invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary\nresources to comply with evolving standards.\nOur stockholders in certain instances have not approved our advisory vote on named executive officer compensation. If we are involved in a lawsuit related to\ncompensation matters or any other matters not covered by our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, we may incur significant expenses in defending\nagainst such lawsuits, or be subject to significant fines or required to take significant remedial actions, each of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf product liability claims are brought against us, we could face substantial liability and costs.\nOur products expose us to product liability claims and product recalls, including, but not limited to, those that may arise from unauthorized off-label use,\nmalfunctions, design flaws or manufacturing defects related to our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems. In addition,\nas we continue to expand our product portfolio, we may enter or create new markets, including consumer markets, which may expose us to additional product\nliability risks. For example, with our previous acquisition of TNI®, we added softFlow® technology to our product portfolio. While this technology provides\nefficient, quiet and comfortable respiratory support to patients, it may present increased risk of infection to caregivers. In addition, with the Sound United\nAcquisition, we added multiple broadly distributed premium audio brands to our product portfolio and significantly expanded our consumer base worldwide,\nwhich could expose us to increased product liability claims.\nWe cannot be certain that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any or all damages for product liability claims that may be brought against\nus in the future. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against\nany product liability claims.\nAdditionally, the laws and regulations regarding product liability are constantly evolving, both through the passage of new legislation at the state and federal\nlevels and through new interpretations of existing legislation. As the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding product liability change, we may become\nexposed to greater liability than currently anticipated.\nAny losses that we may suffer from product liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability\nof our technology and products, together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees, may subject us to significant damages and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations.\nCertain manufacturing processes for our products may involve the storage, use, generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, including\nsilicone adhesives, solder and solder paste, sealants, epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. As a result, we\nare subject to certain environmental laws, as well as certain other laws and regulations, that restrict the materials that can be used in our products or in our\nmanufacturing processes. For example, products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in the EU markets under the Restriction of the Use of\nHazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). RoHS prohibits companies from selling products that contain certain hazardous materials in EU member states. In\naddition, the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products.\nCompliance with such regulations may be costly and, therefore, we may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nIn addition, new environmental laws may further affect how we manufacture our products, how we use, generate or dispose of hazardous materials and waste,\nor further affect what materials can be used in our products. Any required changes to our operations or products may increase our manufacturing costs,\ndetrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.\n94\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with our research and manufacturing activities, we use, and our employees may be exposed to, materials that are hazardous to human health,\nsafety or the environment. The risk of accidental injury to our employees or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated, and we could be held\nliable for any resulting damages, the related liability for which could exceed our reserves. We do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities. If an\nenforcement action were to occur, our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed, even if we were to prevail or settle the action on\nterms favorable to us.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any\ncybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our\nsystems and networks, including the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data, and those of our customers, partners,\nsuppliers and third-party service providers. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our internal business information, and to ship products to customers\nand invoice them on a timely basis, depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems.\nPortions of our information technology systems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with on-going\nsystems implementation work. In addition, interfaces between our products and our customers’ computer networks could provide additional opportunities for\ncybersecurity attacks on us and our customers. The techniques used to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from\nless regulated and remote areas of the world. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, and while none that we have experienced to date have\nbeen material in nature, we expect that we will continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks in the future. Cybersecurity threats and attacks in particular are\nevolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security\nbreaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although the\ncyber incidents experienced to date have not had a material impact, there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent or detect security\nbreaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the\nunderlying information technology system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these\nsystems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product\nfulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our\nsystems and information contained within those systems could also subject us to significant litigation and regulatory enforcement risks in all of the jurisdictions\nin which we operate.\nThe impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Palestine-Iran war, on the global economy, energy supplies and raw materials is\nuncertain, but may prove to negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe short and long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the war in Israel are difficult to predict at this time. We continue to monitor any\nadverse impact that the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent institution of sanctions against Russia by the U.S. and several European and Asian\ncountries; along with the war in Israel, may have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our\nsuppliers and customers. For example, a prolonged conflict may result in challenges associated with timely receipt of customer payments and banking\ntransactions in Russia, increased inflation, escalating energy prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of raw materials. In addition, as a\nresult of the current conflict, we have stopped selling non-healthcare products in Russia indefinitely. Furthermore, the Israel-Palestine-Iran war could result in\ndisruption in the Middle East more broadly and negatively impact our operations in that region. We will continue to monitor these fluid situations and develop\ncontingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop. To the extent the wars in Ukraine or Israel may adversely\naffect our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. Such risks include, but are not\nlimited to, adverse effects on macro-economic conditions, including inflation; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through\ncyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our product\nprices; disruptions in global supply chains; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been and could continue to be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities. For example, our closing stock price\nranged from $104.79 to $146.85 per share from December 31, 2023 to September 28, 2024.\n95\nTable of Contents\nFactors contributing to our stock price volatility may include our financial performance, as well as broader economic, political and market factors. In addition\nto the other risk factors previously discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there are many other factors that we may not be able to control that could\nhave a significant effect on our stock price. These include, but are not limited to:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements of new products;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, including those relating to our earnings or financial guidance, our other public announcements and our filings\nwith the SEC;\n• strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n• changes in our growth rates or our competitors’ growth rates;\n• developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n• on-going legal proceedings;\n• our inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n• concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products;\n• changes in financial markets or general economic conditions, including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad;\n• effects of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• sales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board or certain institutional stockholders;\n• our evaluation of a proposed separation of our consumer businesses;\n• shareholder activism;\n• recent changes to our Board and management;\n• changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally; and\n• short selling or other hedging activity in our stock.\nTherefore, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\n*Our investors could experience substantial dilution of their investments as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options, vesting of\noutstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs), or the grant of future equity awards by us.\nAs of September 28, 2024, approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, of which\napproximately 2.2 million shares were subject to options outstanding at such date at a weighted-average exercise price of $102.68 per share, approximately 3.5\nmillion shares were subject to outstanding RSUs, approximately 0.4 million shares were subject to outstanding PSUs and approximately 3.1 million shares\nwere available for future awards under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. Over the past 48 months, we have experienced higher rates of stock option exercises\ncompared to many earlier periods, and this trend may continue. To the extent outstanding options are exercised or outstanding RSUs or PSUs vest, our existing\nstockholders may incur dilution.\nWe rely on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other\nservice providers may further dilute our stockholders.\nFuture resales of our stock, including those by our insiders and a few investment funds, may cause our stock price to decline.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by our directors, our executive officers and a few investment funds. Resales by these stockholders of a\nsubstantial number of such shares, announcements of any proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be\nmade, could significantly reduce the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans\npursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future. Generally, these sales require public filings. Actual or\n96\nTable of Contents\npotential sales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the\ninsider has lost confidence in our stock and reduce the market price of our stock.\nWe have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our incentive equity plans pursuant to Registration Statements on Form S-8. All\nshares issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions on our affiliates\nunder Rule 144. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nWe may elect not to declare cash dividends on our stock, may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis, or may elect not to make\nany additional stock repurchases. As a result, any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock. In addition, the payment of any\nfuture dividends or the repurchase of our stock might limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities.\nOur Board may from time to time declare, and we may pay, dividends on our outstanding shares in the manner and upon the terms and conditions permitted\nunder applicable law. However, we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than paying cash dividends on\nour stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, our Credit Facility may limit our ability to pay cash dividends, repurchase our common stock or make other\ndistributions to stockholders. Any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations,\nearnings, capital requirements, financial condition, business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, our\nCredit Facility places limitations on our ability to pay dividends. In the event our Board declares any dividends, there is no assurance with respect to the\namount, timing or frequency of any such dividends.\nAny repurchase of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan authorized by our Board in June 2022 (Repurchase Program) will be at the discretion of\na committee comprised of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, results of operations, capital\nrequirements, financial conditions, available capital from operations or other sources, including debt, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, on\nAugust 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of\nnet stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Therefore, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, price or timing of any such repurchases. We\nmay elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than repurchasing additional outstanding shares. For additional\ninformation related to our Repurchase Program, please see Note 19, “Equity”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn the event we pay dividends, or make any stock repurchases in the future, our ability to finance any material expansion of our business, including through\nacquisitions, investments or increased capital spending, or to fund our operations, may be limited. In addition, any repurchases we may make in the future may\nnot prove to be at optimal prices. Our Board may modify or amend the Repurchase Program, or adopt a new stock repurchase program, at any time at its\ndiscretion without stockholder approval.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) regulations, global climate change, corporate citizenship and related matters may adversely\naffect our business.\nThere is an increasing focus on ESG risks. Our customers, including distributors and retail partners have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that\ninclude ESG provisions that their suppliers or manufacturers must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. An\nincreasing number of participants in our industries are also joining voluntary ESG groups or organizations. These ESG provisions and initiatives are subject to\nchange, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced\nmanufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or\nprovisions, a customer may cease purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of\noperations.\nFurther, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in new or enhanced legal requirements. There continues to be a\nlack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such uncertainty may have an impact on our business, from the\ndemand for our products to our costs of compliance in the manufacturing and servicing of our products, all of which may impact our results of operations. In\naddition, climate change initiatives and legislation could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain,\nand could also increase insurance and other operating costs. In addition, on March 6, 2024, the SEC finalized new rules for public companies that will require\nextensive climate-related disclosures and significant analysis of the impact of climate-related issues on our business strategy, results of operations, and financial\ncondition (the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules), and extensive attestation requirements. The new rules require disclosure of, among other things, our material\nclimate-related risks and opportunities, greenhouse gas emissions inventory, climate-related targets and goals, and financial impacts of physical and transition\nrisks. Subsequently, in April 2024, the SEC issued an order staying implementation of the SEC Climate Disclosure\n97\nTable of Contents\nRules pending the resolution of certain challenges. Nonetheless, our legal, accounting, and other compliance expenses may increase significantly, and\ncompliance efforts may divert management time and attention as we prepare for the potential implementation of the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules, and such\nexpenses, efforts and diversions of management time and attention may be even greater if the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules ultimately go into effect. We may\nalso be exposed to legal or regulatory action or claims as a result of these new regulations. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing\nexisting climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege our existing climate disclosures\nare misleading or deficient. All of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and/or stock price.\nInvestors, stockholders, consumers, customers, suppliers and other third-parties are increasingly focusing on ESG and corporate social responsibility endeavors\nand reporting and transparency. Certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, customers, suppliers and other third-parties are also\nincreasingly focused on ESG practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived\nto have not responded appropriately, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition and/or stock price may be materially and\nadversely affected. Further, this increased focus on ESG issues may result in new regulations and/or third-party requirements that could adversely impact our\nbusiness, or certain stockholders reducing or eliminating their holdings of our stock, causing our stock price to decline.\n*Loss of or inability to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our consumer audio products could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we have established, and expect to continue to establish, relationships with public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound\nstudios, social media influencers and other endorsers, to develop, evaluate and promote our consumer audio products, as well as establish product authenticity\nwith consumers. However, as competition in our consumer segment has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such relationships have\nincreased, and competition to attract and retain high-quality endorsers has also increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with public\nfigures, music artists, automotive designers, sound studios, social media influencers or other endorsers, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high\nvisibility associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands,\nconsumer product revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound\nstudios, social media influencers or other endorsers, were to stop using our products contrary to their agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In\naddition, certain negative actions taken or statements made by those associated with our products or brands, could impact or harm the reputations of our\nconsumer products, and our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions that may be taken or statements that may be made by\nthem, could impact have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Poor or non-performance by those associated with our products, a failure to\ncontinue to correctly identify promising public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound studios, social media influencers or other endorsers to use\nour products and brands or a failure to enter into cost-effective fee arrangements with any of such endorsers could adversely affect our brands, reputation, sales\nand profitability.\nItem 5. Other Information\nTrading Arrangements\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated any\ncontract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or\nany “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nDisclosure Pursuant to Item 5.03 of Form 8-K – Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.\nOn October 31, 2024, the Board approved and adopted a second amendment to our Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (Second Amendment), effective\nimmediately, to permit special meetings of the Board to be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Lead Independent Director or\nany person serving in any of the foregoing roles on an interim basis or by a majority of the whole Board.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the\ndate they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be no assurance that these forward-\nlooking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are\navailable online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-\nGAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items\nassist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the\nCompany’s on-going core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated\nwith the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in\naddition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company has presented the following non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-\nforma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A\nexpense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense,non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment charge, non-GAAP\noperating expense % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP non-operating\nincome (expense), non-GAAP provision for income taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated\ndefinition),non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and updated definition). This presentation also includes certain preliminary estimated information of\na potential separation of the Company’s consumer business for illustrative and informational purposes and further adjusted for separation items. See “Disclaimer\nRegarding Potential Separation” on the next slide for additional information. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of\nthe company’s core operating results with those of other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the\nCompany’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our business. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP\nreconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\n2\nDisclaimer Regarding Potential Separation\nOn March 22, 2024, Masimo announced that its Board of Directors has authorized management to evaluate a proposed separation of the company’s consumer\nbusiness (the “Potential Separation”). Masimo’s Board of Directors and management are in the process of evaluating the proposed structure of the Potential\nSeparation. Slide 9 of this presentation entitled “Preliminary Estimate: Financial Impact of a Potential Separation” (“Slide 9”) includes an estimate of the financial\nimpact of the Potential Separation; however, the estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes and does not purport to contain or present\nall information relating to any Potential Separation. Moreover, the method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation are still under consideration and\nhave not been determined, approved or finalized, and the final method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation, including the separation of assets and\nliabilities, may differ materially from what is presented and estimated on Slide 9. There can be no assurance that any Potential Separation that may be implemented\nwill be similar in structure to any of the structures illustrated or discussed on Slide 9, that any Potential Separation may be effected at all or the timing of any Potential\nSeparation. Additionally, the estimate on Slide 9 is an illustrative projection that was calculated using the midpoint of Masimo’s 2024 consolidated guidance, which is\nbased on management’s current expectations and beliefs, but is subject to uncertainty and risks, and also relies on a number of assumptions and adjustments as\ndescribed on Slide 9. Accordingly, all of the information on Slide 9 constitute “forward-looking statements” as described on Slide 2 of this presentation entitled “Safe\nHarbor Statement”. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, including in respect of the financial or operating\noutlook for the potential separated businesses (including, without limitation, the realization of any expected efficiencies or cost savings).\nThe forward-looking statements on Slide 9 are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control and\ncould cause the actual results of any Potential Separation to differ materially and adversely from those illustrated on Slide 9 as a result of various risk factors,\nincluding, but not limited to: risks related to the ability to effect or complete any Potential Separation on the terms described on Slide 9, or at all, and to meet any of the\nconditions related thereto; the approval of any Potential Separation by Masimo’s Board of Directors; the ability of the separated businesses to be successful;\nexpectations around the financial impact of any Potential Separation; potential uncertainty during the pendency of any Potential Separation that could affect Masimo’s\nfinancial performance; the possibility that any Potential Separation will not be completed within the anticipated time period or at all; the possibility that any Potential\nSeparation will not achieve its intended benefits; the possibility of disruption, including changes to existing business relationships, disputes, litigation or unanticipated\ncosts in connection with any Potential Separation; the impact that any Potential Separation may have on our employees; the uncertainty of the expected financial\nperformance of Masimo prior to and following completion of any Potential Separation; negative effects of the announcement or pendency of any Potential Separation\non the market price of Masimo’s securities and/or on the financial performance of Masimo; evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes; changes in general economic\nand/or industry specific conditions; actions by third parties, including government agencies; as well as other factors more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are\navailable online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nExcept as required by applicable law, Masimo assumes no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any duty or obligation to, provide any additional or updated\ninformation or to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results, or otherwise. Nothing in this presentation\nwill, under any circumstances (including by reason of this presentation remaining available and not being superseded or replaced by any other presentation or\npublication with respect to Masimo or the Potential Separation), create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of Masimo or any Potential\nSeparation since the date of this presentation.\n3\nExecutive Summary | Second Quarter 2024(1)\n• Healthcare revenue was $344 million, representing 22% reported growth and 23% constant currency growth(2).\nMasimo’s\n• Masimo’s successful and aggressive focus on expanding its footprint with existing customers and winning new\nHealthcare\ncustomers has built a solid foundation for resuming growth now that hospital census has returned to normal levels.\nBusiness\nRemains on Incremental value of new healthcare contracts(3) was $134 million, representing a 28% increase from Q2 2023.\no\nTrack for\nUnrecognized contract revenue(4) was $1.6 billion, representing a 16% increase from Q2 2023.\nGrowth o\nDriver shipments(5) were 58,600; exceeding management’s estimate of 55,000.\no\n• Consolidated revenue was $496 million, including Healthcare revenues of $344 million and Non-Healthcare revenues\nof $152 million.\n• Non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, representing 13% growth; favorable to guidance midpoint(6) by $0.10 (or 13%).\nConsolidated\nRevenue and o Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.2%, representing 420 basis points of year-over-year improvement.\nEarnings\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $73 million, representing 7% growth.\no\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 15%, which improved sequentially from the first quarter but declined modestly versus last\no\nyear due to the return of performance-based compensation to normalized levels in 2024.\n• Operating cash flow was $75 million due to strong earnings and initiatives to improve working capital.\nOther\n• Total debt was $782 million as of Q2 2024, resulting from $93 million of debt paydown during the quarter.\nHighlights\n• Net debt was $649 million as of Q2 2024.\nNotes:\n1.

Masimo\nexpects that any potential separation would result in a full deconsolidation of the financial statements for the separated business. Masimo is currently evaluating all\noptions including (1) the sale of a majority stake in the consumer audio and consumer health businesses (“Joint Venture”), (2) a sale of the consumer audio business\n(“Sound United”) or (3) a spin-off of the consumer audio and consumer health businesses to shareholders.\nAs illustrated above, if a separation is completed, Masimo expects that the separation will improve the profitability of the healthcare business (“RemainCo”).\n• The financial information above assumes a separation of the consumer business without cash proceeds (e.g., spin-off).\n• If a separation transaction (e.g., sale of the consumer audio and consumer health businesses or sale of Sound United only) results in cash proceeds to Masimo, there\nwould be an opportunity to pay down debt (currently ~$782 million) and reduce interest expense (currently ~$40 million, which represents ~$0.55 per share).\n• “Consumer Health and Other Separation Adjustments” above includes adjustments for consumer health product revenues, cost of goods sold, research and\ndevelopment expenses, selling and marketing expenses and certain corporate expenses.\nNotes:\n1. This preliminary estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes. Masimo is currently evaluating the structure of any potential separation of its consumer business, and the method, structure, timing and terms of any such potential\nseparation are still under consideration and have not been determined, approved or finalized.

Consolidated non-GAAP operating income was $72.9 million.\nConsolidated GAAP net income was $16.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Consolidated non-GAAP net income was $46.6\nmillion, or $0.86 per diluted share.\nJoe Kiani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Masimo, said, “Our team’s record-breaking contracting efforts, exceptional\nexecution of margin expansion initiatives and continued innovation drove strong results for shareholders in the second quarter.\nOn the back of that performance and our growing momentum in the healthcare market, we are increasing our full-year 2024\nguidance for healthcare revenue, consolidated operating income and consolidated EPS.”\nFor additional financial details, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at investor.masimo.com to\naccess the second quarter 2024 earnings presentation materials.\nThird Quarter 2024 and Updated Full-Year 2024 Financial Guidance:\nThe Company provided the following estimates for its third quarter 2024 and updated full-year 2024 guidance:\nQ3 2024 Updated Full-Year\nGuidance(1) 2024 Guidance(1)\nNon-GAAP Non-GAAP\n(Updated (Updated\n(in millions, except earnings per diluted share) GAAP Definition)(2) GAAP Definition)(2)\n$2,085 to $2,085 to\nConsolidated revenue $495 to $515 $495 to $515 $2,135 $2,135\n$1,385 to $1,385 to\nHealthcare revenue $335 to $345 $335 to $345 $1,405 $1,405\nNon-healthcare revenue $160 to $170 $160 to $170 $700 to $730 $700 to $730\nConsolidated operating income $27 to $31 $70 to $74 $159 to $173 $317 to $330\nConsolidated earnings per diluted share $0.22 to $0.27 $0.81 to $0.86 $1.74 to $1.89 $3.80 to $4.00\n______________\n(1) Guidance provided August 6, 2024.\n(2) Effective fiscal year 2024, we have updated our non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of all expenses related to our ongoing litigation with\nApple. Masimo had previously only excluded the expenses related to the U.S. International Trade Commission litigation against Apple. Masimo believes\n-1-\nall Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance and has therefore excluded them\nfrom our non-GAAP financial measures.\nSupplementary Non-GAAP Financial Information\nFor additional non-GAAP financial details, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at\ninvestor.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items described below. Management\nbelieves that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results.\nFurthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the\noperations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTherefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to,\nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the\nCompany may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s net operating\nresults on an on-going basis: (i) constant currency revenue growth percentage, (ii) non-GAAP net income (prior definition and\nupdated definition), (iii) non-GAAP (net income) earnings per diluted share (prior definition and updated definition) and (iv) non-\nGAAP operating income/margin (prior definition and updated definition). These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist\ninvestors in making comparisons of the Company’s operating results with those of other companies. Management believes\nconstant currency revenue growth, non-GAAP operating income/margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per\ndiluted share are important measures in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better\nunderstand and evaluate our business.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for the following items:\nConstant currency revenue adjustments\nSome of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign\ncurrency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary significantly from period-to-period depending on the average and\nquarter-end exchange rates during a respective period. We believe that comparing these foreign currency denominated revenues\nby holding the exchange rates constant with the prior year period is useful to management and investors in evaluating our revenue\ngrowth rates on a period-to-period basis. We anticipate that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the related constant currency\nadjustments for calculation of our revenue growth rate will continue to occur in future periods.\nAcquired tangible asset amortization\nThese transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with acquired\ntangible assets and asset valuation step-ups.\nBusiness transition and related costs\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with business transition plans. These items may\ninclude but are not limited to severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, asset impairment, and other related costs to\nrationalize our operational footprint and optimize business results.\nAcquired intangible asset amortization\nThese transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with acquired\nintangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property, trade names and non-competition\nagreements.\n-2-\nAcquisitions, integrations, divestitures, and related costs\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with acquisitions, integrations, investments,\ndivestitures, assets impairments, and in-process research and development.\nLitigation related expenses and settlements (prior definition)\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with certain litigation matters, which can vary in\ntheir characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results.\nLitigation related expenses and settlements (updated definition)\nWe have been engaged in various legal proceedings against Apple since January 2020, including various proceedings in the\nfederal courts, various proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO proceedings”), and a proceeding in the\nU.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC proceeding”). Although we previously excluded only expenses relating to the\nITC proceeding from the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements”, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we\nhave revised the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements” to exclude not only expenses relating to the ITC\nproceeding, but also all other Apple litigation expenses, including those relating to the federal court proceedings and the PTO\nproceedings. We believe all of the Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going\noperating performance, and this updated definition will provide more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our financial performance that otherwise may be obscured by the significant fluctuations in Apple-related\nlitigation expenses.\nOther adjustments\nIn the event there are gains, losses and other adjustments which impact period-to-period comparability and do not represent the\nunderlying ongoing results of the business, the Company may choose to exclude these from non-GAAP earnings.\nRealized and unrealized gains or losses\nThese transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with foreign currency denominated transactions and\ninvestments. Changes in the underlying currency rates relative to the U.S. Dollar may result in realized and unrealized foreign\ncurrency gains and losses between the time these receivables and payables arise and the time that they are settled in cash.\nUnrealized and realized gains and losses on investments may impact the Company’s reported results of operations for a period.\nThese items are highly variable, difficult to predict and outside the control of those responsible for the underlying operations of\nthe business. Other items also included here are mark-to-market gains and losses of derivative contracts that are not designated\nas hedging instruments or the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges.\nFinancing related adjustments\nThe Company may enter into various financial arrangements whereby costs are incurred and certain instrument features are valued\nand expensed accordingly but are not necessarily indicative of the on-going cash flow generation of the Company and therefore\nexcludes these costs from non-GAAP earnings. For GAAP earnings per diluted share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the\nanti-dilutive impact, if applicable, in its diluted shares calculations. However, the Company believes that reflecting the anti-\ndilutive impact of these instruments in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provides management and investors with useful\ninformation in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis.\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments\nIn order to reflect the tax effected impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, the Company will adjust the non-GAAP earnings by the\napproximate tax impact of these adjustments.\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense\nGAAP requires that excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense be reflected in our provision for income\ntaxes rather than paid-in capital. As these excess tax benefits may be highly variable from period-to-period, the Company may\nchoose to exclude these tax benefits from non-GAAP earnings to facilitate comparability between periods and with peers.\n-3-\nSecond Quarter 2024 Actuals versus Second Quarter 2023 Actuals:\nRECONCILIATION OF HEALTHCARE GAAP TO NON-GAAP CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE(1):\nThree Months Ended\nJune 29, July

In addition, Masimo Consumer Audio is home to eight iconic\naudio brands, including Bowers & Wilkins®, Denon®, Marantz®, and Polk Audio®. Our mission is to improve life, improve patient outcomes; and reduce the cost\nof care. Masimo SET® Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry, introduced in 1995, has been shown in over 100 independent and objective\nstudies to outperform other pulse oximetry technologies. Masimo SET® has also been shown to help clinicians reduce severe retinopathy of prematurity in\nneonates, improve CCHD screening in newborns, and, when used for continuous monitoring with Masimo Patient SafetyNet™ in post-surgical wards, reduce\nrapid response team activations, ICU transfers, and costs. Masimo SET® is estimated to be used on more than 200 million patients in leading hospitals and other\nhealthcare settings around the world, and is the primary pulse oximetry at 9 of the top 10 hospitals as ranked in the 2022-23 U.S. News and World Report Best\nHospitals Honor Roll.

In 2013,\nMasimo introduced the Root® Patient Monitoring and Connectivity Platform, built from the ground up to be as flexible and expandable as possible to facilitate\nthe addition of other Masimo and third-party monitoring technologies; key Masimo additions include Next Generation SedLine® Brain Function Monitoring, O3®\nRegional Oximetry, and ISA™ Capnography with NomoLine® sampling lines. Masimo’s family of continuous and spot-check monitoring Pulse CO-Oximeters®\nincludes devices designed for use in a variety of clinical and non-clinical scenarios, including tetherless, wearable technology, such as Radius-7®, Radius-PPG®\nand Radius VSM™, portable devices like Rad-67®, fingertip pulse oximeters like MightySat® Rx, and devices available for use both in the hospital and at home,\nsuch as Rad-97®. Masimo hospital and home automation and connectivity solutions are centered around Root and the Masimo Hospital Automation™ platform,\nand include Iris® Gateway, iSirona™, Patient SafetyNet, Replica®, Halo ION, UniView®, UniView :60™, and Masimo SafetyNet™.

Description of the Company\nMasimo Corporation is a global technology company that develops, manufactures and markets a wide array of patient monitoring technologies, as well as\nautomation and connectivity solutions. The Company’s mission is to improve patient outcomes, reduce the cost of care and take noninvasive monitoring to new\nsites and applications. The Company operates two business segments: healthcare and non-healthcare.\nThe Company’s healthcare products and patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor or circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable\nsensors, software and/or cables. The Company primarily sells its healthcare products to hospitals, emergency medical service providers, home care providers,\nphysician offices, veterinarians, long-term care facilities and consumers through its direct sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\npartners.\nOn April 11, 2022, the Company acquired Viper Holdings Corporation, the parent company of DEI Sales, Inc., d/b/a Sound United (Sound United), via the\nCompany’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Boom Acquisition Corp (Sonic) (Sound United Acquisition). For additional information on the Company’s\nacquisition of Sound United, see Note 18, “Business Combinations”.\nThe Company’s non-healthcare consumer products and home integration technologies are primarily sold or licensed direct-to-consumers, or through authorized\nretailers and wholesalers.\nThe terms “the Company” and “Masimo” refer to Masimo Corporation and, where applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of\nmanagement, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the Company’s condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements at that date. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (fiscal year 2023), filed\nwith the SEC on February 28, 2024. The results for the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for\nthe fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 (fiscal year 2024) or for any other interim period or for any future year.\nFiscal Periods\nThe Company follows a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year. Under a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year, a 52 week fiscal year includes four quarters of 13\nweeks while a 53 week fiscal year includes three 13 week fiscal quarters and one 14 week fiscal quarter. The Company’s last 53 week fiscal year was fiscal\nyear 2020. Fiscal year 2024 is a 52 week fiscal year ending December 28, 2024. All references to years in these notes to condensed consolidated financial\nstatements are fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation,\nincluding certain balance sheet asset accounts in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2023. There was no impact on\npreviously reported total assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity or net income.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include the determination of standalone selling prices, variable consideration, total\nconsideration allocated to each performance obligation within a contract, inventory valuation, valuation of the Company’s equity awards, valuation of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities connected with business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; derivative and equity\ninstruments, deferred taxes and any associated valuation allowances, deferred revenue, accounting for pensions, uncertain income tax positions, litigation costs,\nand related accruals. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 805, Business Combinations, which requires that once control is obtained, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquired\nentity, if applicable, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with the exception of acquired contract assets and contract liabilities\n(i.e., deferred revenue) from contracts with customers. These are recognized and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, if applicable, is\nrecorded as goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company accounts for certain financial instruments at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company determines the fair\nvalue of its financial instruments using the framework prescribed by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and considers the estimated\namount the Company would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and the Company’s creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, the\nCompany may utilize financial models to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. In doing so, the Company uses inputs that include quoted prices\nfor similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs\nfor the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurement\nOn a recurring basis, the Company measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted\nmarket prices or other observable inputs are not available, the Company applies valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Authoritative guidance describes a\nfair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\n● Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n● Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following tables represent the Company’s financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 29, 2024:\nFair Value Measurement Hierarchy\nTotal Carrying\n(in millions) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 94.5 $ 94.5 $ — $ —\nMoney market funds 35.1 35.1 — —\nEquity securities 1.5 1.5 — —\nPension assets 22.9 16.8 6.1 —\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges(1) 13.6 13.6 — —\nDerivative instruments - warrants 0.8 0.8 — —\nTotal assets $ 168.4 $ 162.3 $ 6.1 $ —\n______________\n(1) Includes accrued interest.\nThe following tables represent the Company’s financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 30, 2023:\nFair Value Measurement Hierarchy\nTotal Carrying\n(in millions) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 87.0 $ 87.0 $ — $ —\nMoney market funds 76.0 76.0 — —\nPension assets 23.1 16.8 6.3 —\nEquity securities 1.7 1.7 — —\nDerivative instruments - cash flow hedges(1) 11.6 11.6 — —\nDerivative instruments - warrants 1.0 1.0 — —\nTotal assets $ 200.4 $ 194.1 $ 6.3 $ —\n______________\n(1) Includes accrued interest.\nThe Company invests in checking, savings and money market fund accounts, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued\nusing quoted market prices. These investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents within the Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and its accounting policies.\nThe Company has certain strategic investments in privately-held companies (non-marketable equity securities) and companies that have completed initial\npublic offerings (marketable equity securities). The Company’s marketable equity securities, whose price is based on quoted market price in an active market,\nare classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities are classified as current, short-term investments, or non-current, recorded in other\nnon-current assets, based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The changes in the fair value of those equity\nsecurities are measured at each reporting date and changes in the value of these investments between reporting dates are recorded within non-operating loss.\nThe Company’s pension assets consist of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. The fair value of Level 2 assets is based on observable inputs such as prices or\nquotes for similar assets, adjusted for any differences in terms or conditions that may affect the value of the instrument being valued. The valuation techniques\nused for Level 2 assets may include the use of models or other valuation techniques, but these methods are all based on observable market inputs.\nThe Company also has investments in certain derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n11\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nFor certain other financial assets and liabilities, including restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities, the\ncarrying amounts approximate their fair value primarily due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. The Company also measures certain non-\nfinancial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, in connection with periodic\nevaluations for potential impairment.\nFurthermore, the Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to specific assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company did not have\nany transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the six months ended June 29, 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less, or highly liquid investments\nthat are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, to be cash equivalents. The Company carries cash and cash equivalents at cost, which approximates\nfair value, and they are Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable consist of trade receivables recorded at the time of invoicing of product sales, reduced by reserves for estimated bad debts and returns.\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial\ncondition. Collateral is generally not required. The Company records an allowance for credit losses that it does not expect to collect based on relevant\ninformation, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts are charged off against the allowance when\nthe Company believes they are uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist.\nBased on the risk characteristics, the Company has identified U.S. and international customers as separate portfolios for both segments, and measures expected\ncredit losses on such receivables using an aging methodology.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates the first in, first out\nmethod, and includes material, labor and overhead costs. Inventory valuation adjustments are recorded for inventory items that have become excess or obsolete\nor are no longer used in current production and for inventory items that have a market price less than the carrying value in inventory. The Company generally\ndetermines inventory valuation adjustments based on an evaluation of the expected future use of its inventory on an item by item basis and applies historical\nobsolescence rates to estimate the loss on inventory expected to have a recovery value below cost. The Company also records other specific inventory valuation\nadjustments when it becomes aware of unique events or circumstances that result in an expected recovery value below cost. For inventory items that have been\nwritten down, the reduced value becomes the new cost basis.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nUseful Lives\nBuildings and building improvements 7 to 39 years\nComputer equipment and software 2 to 12 years\nDemonstration units 2 to 3 years\nFurniture and office equipment 2 to 15 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or term of lease\nMachinery, equipment and tooling 3 to 20 years\nOperating lease assets Lesser of useful life or term of lease\nTransportation, vehicles and other 1 to 20 years\n12\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nLand is not depreciated and construction-in-progress is not depreciated until placed in service. Normal repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred,\nwhereas significant improvements that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful\nlives of the related assets. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the\naccounts and any gain or loss on the sale or retirement is recognized in income.\nLessee Right-of-Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an asset underlying an operating\nlease for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from an operating lease. ROU assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally estimates the\napplicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the lease commencement date. Many of the\nCompany’s lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which the Company does not include in its lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to\nbe exercised. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and liabilities associated with certain equipment leases.\nThe Company has also made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases and to exclude short-term\nleases with a term of twelve months or less from its ROU assets and lease liabilities. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of patents, trademarks, software development costs, customer relationships and acquired technology. Costs related to patents\nand trademarks, which include legal and application fees, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Patent\nand trademark amortization commences once final approval of the patent or trademark has been obtained. Patent costs are amortized over the lesser of 10 years\nor the patent’s remaining legal life, which assumes renewals, and trademark costs are amortized over 17 years, and their associated amortization cost is\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For intangibles purchased in an\nasset acquisition or business combination, which mainly include patents, trademarks, customer relationships and acquired technologies, the useful life is\ndetermined largely by valuation estimates of remaining economic life.\nThe Company’s policy is to renew its patents and trademarks. Costs to renew patents and trademarks are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful\nlife of the intangible asset. The Company periodically evaluates the amortization period and carrying basis of patents and trademarks to determine whether any\nevents or circumstances warrant a revised estimated useful life or reduction in value. Capitalized application costs are charged to operations when it is\ndetermined that the patent or trademark will not be obtained or is abandoned.\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. Once\ntechnological feasibility has been established, qualifying costs incurred in development are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and\nsubsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value.\nIntangibles purchased as part of an asset acquisition or business combination historically have included patents, trademarks, customer relationships, developed\ntechnologies and contractual licenses. In certain circumstances the Company has also acquired non-compete agreements tied to certain employment\nrelationships. The useful life for all of these is largely determined by valuation estimates of remaining economic life. In connection with the Sound United\nacquisition, the Company acquired certain trademarks/tradenames, which are intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. These brands are expected to\nmaintain brand value for an indefinite period of time.\n13\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and\nintangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that goodwill might be impaired. In assessing goodwill impairment, the Company has the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine\nwhether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount. The Company has two reporting units, healthcare and non-healthcare. The Company’s qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill\nconsiders various macro-economic, industry-specific and Company-specific factors, including: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant\nCompany-specific actions; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of the Company’s financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in the\nCompany’s market capitalization below its net book value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, then the Company performs a quantitative analysis that compares\nthe fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is\nnot considered impaired; otherwise, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the lesser of: (a) the amount that the carrying amount of such reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value; or (b) the amount of the goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal\nquarter.\nSimilar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment testing, unless circumstances dictate more\nfrequent testing, if impairment indicators exist. Impairment for indefinite-lived assets exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets if necessary for\nimpairment testing require significant judgment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial\nperformance, and other relevant events and factors.\nThe Company reviews finite lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset to the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\nrecognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the\nlower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nEmployee Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit plans that cover certain employees in certain international locations. The Company recognizes the\nfunded status, or the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss. If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan\nassets, the difference or underfunded status represents the pension liability. The Company records a net periodic pension cost in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. The liabilities and annual income or expense are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most\nsignificant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. The Company’s accounting policy includes an annual re-measurement\nof pension assets and obligations. In addition, the Company re-measures pension assets and obligations for significant events, as of the nearest month-end date\non the calendar. The fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices. See Note 21, “Employee Benefits”, for further details.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nfuture tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized\nin the first reporting period that it becomes more-likely-than-not such tax position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets this more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period.\nDifferences between actual results and the Company’s assumptions, or changes in the Company’s assumptions in future periods, are recorded in the period they\nbecome known. The Company records potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. The application of tax laws and regulations\nis subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes\nin legislation, evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from the\nCompany’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the\nenactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that all or\npart of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence,\nincluding recent financial performance, scheduled reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, availability of taxable income in\ncarryback periods and tax planning strategies.\nIncome taxes are highly susceptible to changes from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about the Company’s future income over the\nlives of its deferred tax assets and the impact of changes in valuation allowances. Any difference in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould result in changes to the Company’s results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Other Contract Liabilities\nThe Company generally recognizes revenue following a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers and generally\nprovides for the recognition of revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, net of allowances for\nestimated returns, discounts or sales incentives, as well as taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities, when control over the\npromised goods or services are transferred to the customer.\nHealthcare segment\nWhile the majority of the Company’s healthcare segment revenue contracts and transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some\ntransactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. As a result, contract interpretation, judgment and analysis are required to determine the\nappropriate accounting, including: (i) the amount of the total consideration, as well as variable consideration, (ii) whether the arrangement contains an\nembedded lease, and if so, whether such embedded lease is a sales-type lease or an operating lease, (iii) the identification of the distinct performance\nobligations contained within the arrangement, (iv) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each performance obligation when multiple\nperformance obligations exist, including the determination of standalone selling price, and (v) when to recognize revenue on the performance obligations.\nChanges in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from fixed lease payments\nrelated to equipment supplied under sales-type lease arrangements is recognized once control over the equipment is transferred to the customer, while revenue\nfrom fixed lease payments related to equipment supplied under operating-type lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the lease and variable lease payments are recognized as they occur.\n15\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company derives the majority of its healthcare segment revenue from four primary sources: (i) direct sales under deferred equipment agreements with end-\nuser hospitals where the Company provides up-front monitoring equipment at no up-front charge in exchange for a multi-year sensor purchase commitment;\n(ii) other direct sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other direct customers;\n(iii) sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to distributors who then typically resell to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and\nother customers; and (iv) sales of integrated circuit boards to OEM customers who incorporate the Company’s embedded software technology into their\nmultiparameter monitoring devices. Subject to customer credit considerations, the majority of such sales are made on open accounts using industry standard\npayment terms based on the geography within which the specific customer is located.\nThe Company enters into agreements to sell its monitoring solutions and services, sometimes as a part of arrangements with multiple performance obligations\nthat include various combinations of product sales, equipment leases, software and services. In the case of contracts with multiple performance obligations, the\nauthoritative guidance provides that the total consideration be allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling prices. When\na standalone selling price is not readily observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering multiple factors including, but not\nlimited to, features and functionality of the product, geographies, type of customer, contractual prices pursuant to Group Purchasing Organization (GPO)\ncontracts, the Company’s pricing and discount practices, and other market conditions.\nSales under deferred equipment agreements are generally structured such that the Company agrees to provide certain monitoring-related equipment, software,\ninstallation, training and/or warranty support at no up-front charge in exchange for the customer’s commitment to purchase sensors over the term of the\nagreement, which generally ranges from three years to six years. The Company allocates contract consideration under deferred equipment agreements\ncontaining fixed annual sensor purchase commitments to the underlying lease and non-lease components at contract inception. In determining whether any\nunderlying lease components are related to a sales-type lease or an operating lease, the Company evaluates the customer’s rights and ability to control the use\nof the underlying equipment throughout the contract term, including any equipment substitution rights retained by the Company, as well as the Company’s\nexpectations surrounding potential contract/lease extensions or renewals and the customer’s likelihood to exercise any purchase options.\nBeginning in 2022, for contracts that contain variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate, the Company classifies as operating leases any\nlease components that would have otherwise been classified as sales-type leases that would result in a selling loss upon lease commencement. Revenue\nallocable to non-lease performance obligations is generally recognized as such non-lease performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue allocable to lease\ncomponents under sales-type lease arrangements is generally recognized when control over the equipment is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue allocable to lease components under operating lease arrangements is generally recognized over the term of the operating lease. The Company\ngenerally does not expect to derive any significant value in excess of such asset’s unamortized book value from equipment underlying its operating lease\narrangements after the end of the agreement.\nRevenue from the sale of products and software to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations, other direct customers, distributors and OEM\ncustomers, is recognized by the Company when control of the performance obligations thereunder transfers to the customer based upon the terms of the\ncontract or underlying purchase order.\nRevenue related to OEM rainbow® parameter software licenses is recognized by the Company upon the OEM’s shipment of its product to its customer, as\nreported to the Company by the OEM.\nThe Company provides certain customers with various sales incentives that may take the form of discounts or rebates. The Company records estimates related\nto these programs as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. In general, customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund. However, the Company\nallows returns under certain circumstances. At the end of each period, the Company estimates and accrues for these returns as a reduction to revenue. The\nCompany estimates the revenue constraints related to these forms of variable consideration based on various factors, including expected purchasing volumes,\nprior sales and returns history, and specific contractual terms and limitations.\nNon-healthcare segment\nNon-healthcare segment revenue is related to hardware and embedded software that is integrated into final products that are manufactured and sold by the\nCompany. Products and related software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and all intended functionality is available to the customer upon\npurchase. Non-healthcare segment revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or service to customers, which is either upon shipment\nor upon delivery to the customers, depending on delivery terms.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company offers sales incentives and has customer programs consisting primarily of discounts and market development fund programs, and records them\nas contra revenue. Estimates for sales incentives are developed using the most likely amount and are included in the transaction price to the extent that a\nsignificant reversal of revenue would not result once the uncertainty is resolved. In developing these estimates, the Company also considers the susceptibility of\nthe incentive to outside influences, the length of time until the uncertainty is resolved and the Company’s experience with similar contracts. Reductions in\nrevenue related to discounts are allocated to products on a relative basis based on their respective standard selling price if there are undelivered products in a\ncontract. Judgement is required to determine the timing and amount of recognition of marketing funds which the Company estimates based on past practice of\nproviding similar funds.\nPayment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s distribution channels although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60\ndays of product shipment. Sales made directly to customers from the Company’s website are paid at the time of product shipment. Prior to determining\npayment terms for each customer, an evaluation of such customer’s credit risk is performed. Contractual allowances are an offset to accounts receivable.\nThe Company recognizes non-healthcare royalty revenue associated with certain prepaid license arrangements. The Company recognizes non-healthcare\nrevenue from the prepaid license arrangements based upon sales-based royalties when a subsequent sale occurs.\nShipping and Handling Costs and Fees\nAll shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. Charges for shipping and handling billed to customers are included as a component of revenue.\nTaxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nThe Company’s policy is to present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nDeferred Costs and Other Contract Assets\nThe costs of monitoring-related equipment provided to customers under operating lease arrangements within the Company’s deferred equipment agreements\nare generally deferred and amortized to cost of goods sold over the life of the underlying contracts. Some of the Company’s deferred equipment agreements\nalso contain provisions for certain allowances to be made directly to the end-user hospital customer at the inception of the arrangement. These allowances are\ngenerally allocated to the lease and non-lease components and recognized as a reduction to revenue as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company generally invoices its customers under deferred equipment agreements as sensors are provided to the customer. However, the Company may\nrecognize revenue for certain non-lease performance obligations under deferred equipment agreements with fixed annual commitments at the time such\nperformance obligations are satisfied and prior to the customer being invoiced. When this occurs, the Company records an unbilled contract receivable related\nto such revenue until the customer has been invoiced pursuant to the terms of the underlying deferred equipment agreement.\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized and deferred if the Company expects such costs to be recoverable over the life of\nthe contract and the contract term is greater than one year. Such deferred costs generally relate to certain incentive sales commissions earned by the Company’s\ninternal sales team in connection with the execution of deferred equipment agreements and are amortized to expense over the expected term of the underlying\ncontract.\nWarranty\nThe Company generally provides a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period ranging from six months to forty-eight months,\ndepending on the product type. In traditional sales activities, including direct and OEM sales, the Company establishes an accrued liability for the estimated\nwarranty costs at the time of revenue recognition, with a corresponding provision to cost of goods sold. Customers may also purchase extended warranty\ncoverage or service level upgrades separately or as part of a deferred equipment agreement. Revenue related to extended warranty coverage and service level\nupgrades is generally recognized over the life of the contract, which reasonably approximates the period over which such services will be provided. The related\nextended warranty and service level upgrade costs are expensed as incurred.\n17\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nChanges in the product warranty accrual were as follows:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 29, July 1,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nProduct warranty accrual, beginning of period $ 8.6 $ 10.6\nAccrual for warranties issued 4.8 5.6\nChanges in pre-existing warranties (including changes in estimates) 1.5 (5.9)\nSettlements made (5.8) (1.0)\nProduct warranty accrual, end of period $ 9.1 $ 9.3\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs include certain advertising, marketing and endorsement agreement fees. Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nEndorsement fees associated with product endorsers are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Advertising costs are included in\nselling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prepayments made under endorsement\nagreements are included in other current assets or other non-current assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain endorsement\nagreements provide for royalty payments to endorsers based on sales of particular products, which the Company records in selling, general and administrative\nexpense as the related sales occur. Advertising costs for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 were $14.9 million and $14.4 million,\nrespectively. Advertising costs for the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 were $26.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively.\nLitigation Costs and Contingencies\nThe Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following\nconditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date\nof the financial statements, and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of whether a loss contingency, litigation settlement or\ncontingent fee is probable or reasonably possible involves a significant amount of management judgment, as does the estimation of the range of loss given the\nnature of contingencies or any associated contingent fees related to a settlement of a legal matter. Liabilities related to litigation settlements with multiple\nelements are recorded based on the fair value of each element. Legal and other litigation related expenses are recognized as the services are provided.\nContingent legal fee expenses are recognized when probable and reasonably estimable. The Company records insurance and other indemnity recoveries for\nlitigation expenses when both of the following conditions are met: (a) the recovery is probable, and (b) collectability is reasonably assured. Insurance\nrecoveries are only recorded to the extent the litigation costs to which they relate have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s international headquarters is in Switzerland, and its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company has many other foreign subsidiaries,\nand the largest transactions in foreign currency translations occur in the Japanese Yen, the British Pound, the Chinese Yuan and the European Euro.\nThe Company records certain revenues and expenses in foreign currencies. These revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars based on the average\nexchange rate for the reporting period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect as\nof the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of a subsidiary that are denominated in the functional\ncurrency of such subsidiary are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Company, or a subsidiary that\nare not denominated in the underlying functional currency are included as a component of non-operating (loss) income within the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n18\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nDerivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company addresses market risk from changes in interest rates risks through risk management programs, which include the use of derivative instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to a counterparty’s credit risk is generally limited to the amounts of the net obligation to the counterparty. The Company established\npolicies to enter into contracts only with major investment-grade financial institutions to mitigate such counterparty credit risk. The Company also established a\npolicy to further monitor the counterparty risks throughout the life of the instruments. None of the derivative instruments currently held by the Company were\nentered into for speculative trading purposes.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are classified as\nshort-term or long-term based on the tenor of the instrument. The Company has elected not to separate a derivative instrument into current and long-term\nportions. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net liability is classified as current in total. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net asset and\nwhose current portion is an asset is classified as non-current in total. For a derivative instrument that meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, the\nCompany marks the fair value of the derivative instrument to market periodically through other comprehensive (loss) income. When the hedged items are\nrecorded to income (loss), the associated deferred gains (losses) of the derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income will be reclassified into\nearnings. Any fluctuation in the fair value of a derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting is recorded to earnings (expense) in\nthe period it occurs.\nComprehensive (Loss) Income\nComprehensive (loss) income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, changes to pension benefits, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges and\nany related tax benefits (expenses) that have been excluded from net income and reflected in stockholders’ equity.\nNet Income Per Share\nA computation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 29, July 1, June 29, July 1,\n(in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 16.0 $ 15.7 $ 34.9 $ 37.0\nBasic net income per share:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 53.1 52.8 53.1 52.7\nNet income per basic share $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.66 $ 0.70\nDiluted net income per share:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 53.1 52.8 53.1 52.7\nDiluted share equivalents: stock options, RSUs and PSUs 1.2 1.6 1.2 1.6\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 54.3 54.4 54.3 54.3\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.64 $ 0.68\n19\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Net income per\ndiluted share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of shares and potential shares outstanding during the period, if the effect\nof potential shares is dilutive. Potential shares include incremental shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of both restricted\nshare units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). For the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, weighted options to purchase 1.4 million\nand 0.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the effect\nof including such shares would have been antidilutive in the applicable period. For the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, weighted options to\npurchase 1.4 million and 0.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income per\nshare because the effect of including such shares would have been antidilutive in the applicable period. Certain RSUs were considered contingently issuable\nshares as their vesting is contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Since such events had not occurred and were not considered probable of\noccurring as of each of June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, 2.7 million weighted-average shares related to such RSUs have been excluded from the calculation of\npotential shares for the three and six month periods then ended.

The new standard is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a\nreportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The amendment also requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU No. 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Upon\ntransition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified\nand disclosed in the period of adoption.

As a result, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which resulted in recording a $7.0 million impairment charge\nfor indefinite-lived trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit. In conjunction with this third quarter interim impairment quantitative assessment, the\nCompany concluded that both the healthcare reporting unit’s and non-healthcare reporting unit’s respective estimated fair values exceeded their carrying\nvalues. Furthermore, recoverability tests performed for other long-lived assets with finite lives indicated no recoverability issues.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment of its\nindefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived\nintangibles within the non-healthcare reporting unit exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to perform a quantitative impairment\nassessment, which resulted in recording a $3.0 million impairment charge for indefinite-lived trademarks. For purposes of the impairment test, the fair value of\nindefinite-lived assets were determined using the same methodology as described in Note 18, “Business Combinations.” The estimates and assumptions applied\nrepresent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s assumptions in measuring fair value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment\nfor its healthcare and non-healthcare reporting units. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of\nthe healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required for the healthcare reporting unit. However, the\nCompany concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the non-healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Therefore,\nthe Company proceeded to perform a quantitative assessment for its non-healthcare reporting unit.\nWhen a quantitative assessment is required for the impairment test for goodwill, the Company uses a combination of both an income and a market approach to\ndetermine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market\napproach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach to calculate projected future discounted cash\nflows included revenue growth rates, operating margins and a discount rate for the reporting unit. Discount rates were determined using a weighted average\ncost of capital for risk factors specific to the reporting unit and other market and industry data. The assumptions used are inherently subject to uncertainty and\nthe Company noted that slight changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value.\nThe estimates and assumptions applied represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s\nassumptions in measuring fair value.\n10.

Lessee ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company leases certain facilities in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions under operating lease agreements expiring\nat various dates through January 2032. In addition, the Company leases equipment in the U.S. and Europe pursuant to leases that are classified as operating\nleases and expire at various dates through November 2028. The majority of these leases are non-cancellable and generally do not contain any material\nrestrictive covenants, material residual value guarantees, or other material guarantees. The Company recognizes lease costs under these agreements using a\nstraight-line method based on total lease payments. Certain facility leases contain predetermined price escalations and in some cases renewal options, the\nlongest of which is for five years.\nThe Company generally estimates the applicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the\nlease commencement date. As of June 29, 2024, the weighted-average discount rate used by the Company for all operating leases was approximately 4.6%.\nThe balance sheet classifications for amounts related to the Company’s operating leases for which it is the lessee are as follows:\nJune 29, December 30,\n(in millions) Balance sheet classification 2024 2023\nLessee ROU assets Other non-current assets $ 76.1 $ 59.1\nLessee current lease liabilities Other current liabilities 20.1 18.2\nLessee non-current lease liabilities Other non-current liabilities 61.7 45.8\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 81.8 $ 64.0\nAs of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023, accumulated amortization for lessee ROU assets was $52.5 million and $48.9 million, respectively. The\nweighted-average remaining lease term for the Company’s operating leases was 5.4 years as of June 29, 2024.\nAs of June 29, 2024, estimated future operating lease payments for each of the following fiscal years were as follows:\nAmount\nFiscal year (in millions)\n2024 (balance of year) $ 11.6\n2025 21.6\n2026 17.0\n2027 12.4\n2028 11.7\nThereafter(1) 19.6\nTotal 93.9\nImputed interest (12.1)\nPresent value $ 81.8\n______________\n(1) Includes optional renewal period for certain leases.\nDuring the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, operating lease costs were approximately $6.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively. During\nthe six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, operating lease costs were approximately $11.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended March 30, 2024, as part of the Company’s on-going rationalization of its operational footprint of the non-healthcare business,\none operating lease was identified as under-utilized and considered temporarily idled due to the inability to sublease the property timely while having three\nyears remaining on the lease term. The ROU asset had a net carrying value of approximately $5.8 million and the undiscounted future expected cash flows total\n$1.5 million. The recoverability test failed due to the undiscounted cash flows being less than the carrying value of the ROU asset. As a result, the Company\nrecorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.9 million during the three months ended March 30, 2024, which was recorded in selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n28\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n12.

Generally, both healthcare and non-healthcare segments record deferred revenue when revenue is to be recognized\nsubsequent to invoicing.\nHealthcare Deferred Revenue\nHealthcare deferred revenue primarily relates to undelivered equipment, sensors and services under deferred equipment agreements, extended warranty\nagreements, and maintenance agreements. Expected revenue from remaining contractual performance obligations (Unrecognized Contract Revenue) includes\ndeferred revenue, as well as other amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods when the Company completes its performance\nobligations. Unrecognized Contract Revenue excludes revenue allocable to monitoring-related equipment that is effectively leased to customers under deferred\nequipment agreements and other contractual obligations for which neither party has performed. The estimated timing of this revenue is based, in part, on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions about when its performance obligations will be completed. As a result, the actual timing of this revenue in future\nperiods may vary, possibly materially. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had approximately $1,601.9 million of Unrecognized Contract Revenue related to\nexecuted contracts with an original duration of one year or more.

Debt issuance costs of\n$8.4 million were recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Credit Facility and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest\nmethod.\nThe Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility will be deemed, at the Company’s election, either: (a) an Alternate Base Rate (ABR) Loan, which bears interest at the\nABR, plus a spread of 0.000% to 0.750% based upon a Company leverage ratio, or (b) a Term SOFR Loan, which bears interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR\nRate (as defined below), plus a spread of 1.000% to 1.750% based upon a Company net leverage ratio. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the ABR is\nequal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York effective rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR\nplus 1.0%. The Adjusted Term SOFR Rate is equal to the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the applicable interest period plus a spread\nadjustment of 0.10%, 0.15% and 0.25% for the interest periods ending one, three and six months, respectively.\nThe Company is also obligated under the Credit Facility to pay an unused fee ranging from 0.150% to 0.275% per annum, based upon a Company leverage\nratio, with respect to any non-utilized portion of the Credit Facility.\nThe Company is subject to certain covenants, including financial covenants related to a net leverage ratio and an interest charge coverage ratio, and other\ncustomary negative covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default which, upon the occurrence of any such event of default, provide\nthe Initial Lenders (and any additional lenders) with the right to take either or both of the following actions: (a) immediately terminate the commitments, and\n(b) declare the loans then outstanding immediately due and payable in full. All unpaid principal under the Credit Facility will become due and payable on April\n12, 2027.\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment) with the Initial Lenders and Citibank, N.A., as\nthe administrative agent, which amended the Credit Facility. The First Amendment provides for an additional $205 million of unsecured revolving\ncommitments, increasing the aggregate amount of the Revolver from $500 million to $705 million.\nBorrowing rates, financial covenants, affirmative and negative covenants and other restricted terms remain unchanged from the Credit Facility. All unpaid\nprincipal under the First Amendment will become due and payable on April 12, 2027. The Company was in full compliance with all covenants contained in its\ndebt agreements and Credit Facility agreements as of June 29, 2024.\nFor the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company incurred total interest expense of $10.6 million and $11.0 million under the Credit\nFacility, respectively. For the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company incurred total interest expense of $21.8 million and $22.0 million\nunder the Credit Facility, respectively.\nFurthermore, in connection with the Sound United acquisition, the Company assumed three outstanding loans as follows:\nJapanese Revolving Loan\nIn March 2020, the Company entered into a secured revolving loan (Japanese Revolving Loan) with Mizuho bank, which allows the Company to borrow up to\n¥800 million (approximately $5.0 million). The Japanese Revolving Loan is an evergreen agreement that terminates upon request by either the financial\ninstitution or the borrower and is collateralized with land and buildings in Shirakawa-Shi owned by the borrower. Interest accrues at a rate equal to the Mizuho\nTokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus a fixed spread of 0.50% per annum. In connection with the execution of the Japanese Revolving Loan, the\nCompany incurred debt issuance costs of ¥7.2 million (approximately $0.1 million).\n31\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nOn February 28, 2023, the Company and Mizuho Bank executed an amendment to the Japanese Revolving Loan, to increase the maximum aggregate revolving\nloan to ¥3.0 billion (approximately $18.6 million).

Since July 2022, the Company has entered into various interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges on\na substantial portion of the Company’s outstanding debt. The interest rate swaps reduce the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting\nthe variable interest rate on the Company’s long-term debt to an average fixed interest rate of 3.26%. These contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of\napproximately three years. All hedging relationships were highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged.\nThe Company used a regression analysis at hedge inception to assess the effectiveness of cash flow hedge and periodically thereafter.\nThe Company records gains and losses from the changes in the fair value of these instruments as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Deferred\ngains or losses from these designated cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged items affect earnings. The Company does not\noffset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments in its condensed consolidated balance sheets for presentation purposes. The following table\nsummarizes the fair value of the hedging instruments, presented on a gross basis, as of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\nCondensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets\nJune 29, December 30,\n(in millions) Balance sheet classification 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts, inclusive of accrued interest Other non-current assets $ 13.6 $ 11.6\nInterest rate contracts, inclusive of accrued interest Other non-current liabilities — (3.6)\nTotal $ 13.6 $ 8.0\n33\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for the three months and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.\nCondensed Consolidated\nCash flow hedges Statement of Operations\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 29, July 1, June 29, July 1,\n(in millions) Location of gains (losses) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate contracts Non-operating (loss) $ 4.1 $ 3.8 $ 8.3 $ 6.8\nTotal $ 4.1 $ 3.8 $ 8.3 $ 6.8\nThe following tables summarize the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the hedging instruments for the three months and six\nmonths ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 29, July 1, June 29, July 1,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 14.3 $ 13.6 $ 7.8 $ 19.3\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) 3.3 11.3 14.0 8.6\nAmount reclassified into earnings (4.1) (3.8) (8.3) (6.8)\nEnding balance $ 13.5 $ 21.1 $ 13.5 $ 21.1\nFor the three months ended June 29, 2024, the unrealized loss, net of tax was $0.6 million.

Business Combinations\nSound United Acquisition\nOn April 11, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Sound United. Sound United is a leading innovator of premium, high-performance audio\nproducts for consumers around the world, which operates iconic consumer brands: Bowers & Wilkins®, Denon™, Marantz™, HEOS™, Classé™, Polk Audio™,\nBoston Acoustics™ and Definitive Technology™. The brands are linked by a commitment to the highest production standards and a focus on unparalleled audio\nquality and audio performance. Sound United delivers significant competitive benefits through its platform advantages including global distribution across\nonline, retail, and custom installation channels; a cloud-connected home ecosystem; and a state-of-the-art research and development function focused on\ncreating the highest-quality consumer products with world-class industrial design.\nThe Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sound United for $1.0575 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on Sound United’s net working\ncapital, transaction expenses, cash and debt as of the closing of the acquisition, payable by the Company in cash. The transaction was primarily funded with the\nproceeds from the Credit Facility. See Note 15, “Debt”, for additional information about the Credit Facility. There was no contingent consideration resulting\nfrom the transaction.\nThe results of operations of Sound United subsequent to the acquisition date and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including the allocation of\ngoodwill and intangible assets, are included in the non-healthcare segment. For the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company recorded\nrevenue of $151.8 million and $174.1 million, respectively, and a net loss of $6.8 million and $5.7 million from Sound United, respectively. For the six months\nended July 1, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of $304.2 million and $390.7 million, respectively, and a net loss of $25.7 million and $3.3 million from\nSound United, respectively.\nAcquisition Costs\nThe Company recognized no transaction costs related to the Sound United acquisition for each of the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1,\n2023.\n34\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nPurchase Price Allocations\nThe purchase price allocation for the Sound United acquisition is final. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from intangible assets\nacquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe measurement period adjustments resulted primarily from valuation inputs pertaining to certain acquired assets based on facts and circumstances that\nexisted as of the acquisition date and did not result from events subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe table below summarizes the final allocation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n(in millions) Sound United\nCash consideration $ 1,057.5\nPurchase price $ 1,057.5\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 82.6\nAccounts receivables 108.5\nInventories 238.6\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 30.0\nProperty, plant and equipment 113.2\nIntangible assets 649.0\nGoodwill 318.0\nLong-term other assets 7.4\nTotal assets acquired $ 1,547.3\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable $ (118.8)\nAccrued liabilities and other current liabilities (148.9)\nDeferred tax liabilities (145.1)\nOther long-term liabilities (77.0)\nTotal liabilities assumed $ (489.8)\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the weighted average amortization period as of the acquisition date:\nWeighted average April 11,\namortization period 2022\n(in years) (in millions)\nTrademarks/tradenames 10 $ 6.0\nCustomer relationships 17 196.0\nDeveloped technology 8 156.0\nContractual license agreements 15 29.0\nSubtotal 14 years $ 387.0\nIndefinite trademarks/tradenames N/A 262.0\nTotal $ 649.0\nIn determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being\nvalued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow\nstream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors.\n35\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nOther inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates. Contractual license agreements have a weighted-average\namortization period of five years until the next renewal term.\nThe intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:\nCustomer relationships\nThe fair value of customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method involves\nforecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets, and then discounting the\nresulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\nTrademarks/tradenames\nThe fair values of the trademark/tradenames were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting\navoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was\napplied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life,\nroyalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\nDeveloped technology\nThe fair values of the developed technology were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting\navoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was\napplied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life,\nroyalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\nContractual licensing agreements\nThe fair value of the contractual license agreements was determined using a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method. This method involves\nforecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset and then discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate\ndiscount rate.\n19. Equity\nSeries A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Stockholder Rights Plan\nIn September 2022, the Company authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of its common\nstock to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 20, 2022 (the Record Date) pursuant to a Rights Agreement, dated as of September 9,\n2022 (Rights Agreement), with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. as Rights Agent. In addition, one Right was issued with each share of common\nstock that became outstanding after the Record Date. Each Right entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one thousandth of one share of\nthe Company’s Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price equal to $1,000.00 per Right, subject to adjustment.\nGenerally, the Rights were to become exercisable in the event any person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 10%\n(20% in the case of a passive institutional investor), subject to certain exceptions.\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company and the Rights Agent entered into an amendment (Rights Agreement Amendment) to the Rights Agreement. The Rights\nAgreement Amendment accelerated the expiration of the Rights to 5:00 P.M., New York time, on March 22, 2023, and the Rights Agreement terminated at such\ntime. At the time of the termination of the Rights Agreement, all Rights distributed to holders of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Rights\nAgreement expired.\n36\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn June 2022, the Board approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of its common stock on or before\nDecember 31, 2027 (2022 Repurchase Program). The 2022 Repurchase Program became effective in July 2022. The Company expects to fund the 2022\nRepurchase Program through its available cash, cash expected to be generated from future operations, the Credit Facility and other potential sources of capital.\nThe 2022 Repurchase Program can be carried out at the discretion of a committee comprised of the Company’s CEO and CFO through open market purchases,\none or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, block trades and privately negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased pursuant to the 2022 Repurchase\nProgram during the six months ended June 29, 2024. As of June 29, 2024, 5.0 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the 2022\nRepurchase Program.\n20. Stock-Based Compensation\nTotal stock-based compensation expense (benefit) for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 was $13.5 million and $(8.6) million,\nrespectively. Total stock-based compensation expense (benefit) for the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 was $23.1 million and $(1.3) million,\nrespectively. The stock-based compensation expense amounts for each of the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 reflect adjustments for\nthe expected life-to-date achievement of certain PSUs. The Company reassesses the expected achievement of such PSU awards based upon the achievement of\ncertain pre-established multi-year performance criteria approved by the Board at the date of grant.\nAs of June 29, 2024, an aggregate of 9.6 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the Company’s equity plans, of which 3.1\nmillion shares were available for future grant under the Masimo Corporation 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (2017 Equity Plan). Additional information related to\nthe Company’s current equity incentive plans, stock-based award activity and valuation of stock-based awards is included below.\nEquity Incentive Plans\n2017 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn June 1, 2017, the Company’s stockholders ratified and approved the 2017 Equity Plan. The 2017 Equity Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted\nstock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, performance shares, performance bonus awards and other stock or cash awards to employees, directors and\nconsultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any parent or subsidiary of the Company. Upon effectiveness, an aggregate of 5.0 million shares\nwere available for issuance under the 2017 Equity Plan. In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase of 2.5 million shares to the 2017\nEquity Plan. The aggregate number of shares that may be awarded under the 2017 Equity Plan is 7.5 million shares. The 2017 Equity Plan provides that at least\n95% of the equity awards issued under the 2017 Equity Plan must vest over a period of not less than one year following the date of grant. The exercise price per\nshare of each option granted under the 2017 Equity Plan may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of\ngrant, which is generally equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date.\n2007 Stock Incentive Plan\nEffective June 1, 2017, upon the approval and ratification of the 2017 Equity Plan, the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) terminated,\nprovided that awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of that plan. In addition, upon the effectiveness of the\n2017 Equity Plan, an aggregate of 5.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock registered under prior registration statements for issuance pursuant to the\n2007 Equity Plan were deregistered and concurrently registered under the 2017 Equity Plan.\n37\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nStock-Based Award Activity\nStock Options\nThe number and weighted-average exercise price of options issued and outstanding under all of the Company’s equity plans are as follows:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 29, 2024\nWeighted-Average\n(in millions, except for weighted-average exercise prices) Shares Exercise Price\nOptions outstanding, beginning of period 2.8 $ 87.79\nGranted 0.1 126.49\nCanceled — 164.32\nExercised (0.3) 37.53\nOptions outstanding, end of period 2.6 $ 93.89\nOptions exercisable, end of period 2.3 $ 83.48\nTotal stock option expense for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 was $1.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

Included in the granted amount are those additional PSUs earned based on actual performance achieved. These PSUs were\noriginally awarded at target.\nDuring the six months ended June 29, 2024, the Company awarded 155,156 PSUs that will vest three years from the award date, based on the achievement of\ncertain pre-established multi-year performance criteria approved by the Board. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance\nconditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions and the cumulative effect of any changes in the probability outcomes is recorded\nin the period in which the changes occur. If earned, the PSUs granted will vest upon achievement of the performance criteria, which include a relative total\nshareholder return (TSR) component, in the year following the evaluation and confirmation of the performance achievement criteria. The Company’s TSR is\nbased on the Company’s common stock percentile ranking relative to the constituents of the Nasdaq Composite Index for the performance period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2026. The number of shares that may be earned can range from 0% to 200% of the target amount. The fair value\nof market-based RSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the\nmarket condition requirements. The fair value of performance-based PSUs is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant\ndate. Based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest, total PSU expense (benefit) for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and\nJuly 1, 2023 was $3.3 million and $(16.0) million, respectively. Total PSU expense (benefit) for the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 was\n$3.6 million and $(15.3) million, respectively. The PSU expense amounts for the three months ended June 29, 2024 relate to adjustments for the expected life-\nto-date performance of the PSU. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had $32.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards\nexpected to be recognized and vest over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nValuation of Stock-Based Award Activity\nThe fair value of each RSU and PSU is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. The range\nof assumptions used and the resulting weighted-average fair value of options granted at the date of grant were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 29, July 1 June 29, July 1,\n2024(1) 2023(1) 2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate —% —% 4.2% 4.2%\nExpected term (in years) — — 5.9 5.9\nEstimated volatility —% —% 42.6% 36.7%\nExpected dividends —% —% —% —%\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted $— $— $59.60 $75.08\n______________\n(1) No options were granted during the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options is calculated as the positive difference, if any, between the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date\nof exercise or the respective period end, as appropriate, and the exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding with an\nexercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of June 29, 2024 was $117.2 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options\nexercisable with an exercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of June 29, 2024 was $117.2 million.\n21. Employee Benefits\nDefined Contribution Plans\nIn the U.S. the Company sponsors one qualified defined contribution plan or 401(k) plan, the Masimo Retirement Savings Plan (MRSP), covering the\nCompany’s full-time U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. On April 11, 2022, in connection with the Sound United acquisition, the MRSP\nwas amended to allow for participation by eligible Sound United employees.\nThe MRSP matches 100% of a participant’s salary deferral, up to 3% of each participant’s compensation for the pay period, subject to a maximum amount. The\nCompany may also contribute to the MRSP on a discretionary basis. The Company contributed $1.3 million to the MRSP for each of the three months ended\nJune 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, all in the form of matching contributions. The Company contributed $2.5 million and $2.7 million to the MRSP for the six\nmonths ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, all in the form of matching contributions.\nIn addition, some of the Company’s international subsidiaries also have defined contribution plans to which both the employee and employers are eligible to\nmake contributions. The Company contributed $1.3 million and $1.4 million to these plans for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023,\nrespectively. The Company contributed $2.9 million and $2.8 million to these plans for the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors several international noncontributory defined benefit plans. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, the Company assumed\nsponsorship of several international defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans. All defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans assumed\nby the Company were closed to new participants prior to the Sound United acquisition.\nThe service cost component for the defined benefit plans are recorded in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other\ncost components are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company’s net periodic defined benefit costs for each of the three and six months ended June 29, 2024, and July 1, 2023 were immaterial.\n40\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n22.

Income Taxes\nThe Company has provided for income taxes in fiscal year 2024 interim periods based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year, as\nadjusted for discrete tax events, including excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, in the period such events occur. The\nestimated annual effective tax rate is computed based on the expected annual pretax income of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction\nbased on legislation enacted as of the balance sheet date. For the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax\nbenefits of approximately $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation. For the six months\nended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $3.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to\nexcess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses\nreported for accounting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent that the Company cannot determine that the\nultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not. Realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of\nfuture taxable income, the estimation of which requires significant judgment by the Company’s management. The judgment of the Company’s management\nregarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the Company’s ability to successfully execute its\nbusiness plans or tax planning strategies. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances.\nAs of June 29, 2024, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was approximately $37.3 million. If fully recognized, approximately\n$34.7 million (net of federal benefit on state taxes) would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized\ntax benefits in various jurisdictions may change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements. However, due to\nthe uncertainty surrounding the timing of these events, an estimate of the change within the next twelve months cannot currently be made.\nThe Company conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and, as a result, one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal,\nvarious state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2019. All material state, local\nand foreign income tax matters have been concluded through fiscal year 2016. The Company does not believe that the results of any tax authority examination\nwould have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n41\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\n24.

In addition, in the event of a “Change-in-Control” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement) prior to a\nQualifying Termination, on each of the first and second anniversaries of the Change-in-Control, 50% of the Cash Payment and 50% of the Award Shares will\nvest, subject in each case to Mr. Kiani’s continuous employment through each such anniversary date; however, in the event of a Qualifying Termination or a\ntermination of Mr. Kiani’s employment due to death or disability prior to either of such anniversaries, any unvested amount of the Cash Payment and all of the\nunvested Award Shares shall vest and be paid in full. Additionally, in the event of a Change-in-Control prior to a Qualifying Termination, Mr. Kiani’s stock\noptions and any other equity awards will vest in accordance with their terms, but in no event later than in two equal installments on each of the one year and\ntwo year anniversaries of the Change-in- Control, subject in each case to Mr. Kiani’s continuous employment through each such anniversary date.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Amended Employment Agreement (Second Amendment) with Mr. Kiani. The\nSecond Amendment provides that the RSUs granted to Mr. Kiani pursuant to the Amended Employment Agreement will vest in full upon the termination of Mr.\nKiani’s employment with the Company pursuant to Mr. Kiani’s death or disability.\nOn February 8, 2023, Mr. Kiani agreed that the valid election to the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of\nStockholders (2023 Annual Meeting) of any two individuals nominated by the Company’s stockholders in lieu of two of the Company’s then-current Board\nmembers would not be deemed to constitute a “Change in Control” for purposes of Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement.\nOn March 22, 2023, in connection with the Board’s unanimous selection of H Michael Cohen as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Kiani voluntarily irrevocably\nand permanently waived his right to treat the appointment of any lead independent director as “Good Reason”, to terminate his employment under the\nAmended Employment Agreement, and his right to receive contractual separation payments on this basis.\nOn June 5, 2023, Mr. Kiani, pursuant to a Limited Waiver (Waiver), unconditionally, irrevocably and permanently waived his right, pursuant to the Amended\nEmployment Agreement, to assert that a “Change in Control” has occurred pursuant to Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement unless the\nindividuals who constituted the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding such change, as defined in Section 9(iii) of the\nAmended Employment Agreement, cease for any reason to constitute one-half or more of the directors then in office. In addition, Mr. Kiani agreed that, for\npurposes of determining whether such a “Change in Control” has occurred, any individual elected to the Board at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting will be\ntreated as a member of the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.\nAs a result of Mr. Kiani’s execution of the Waiver on June 5, 2023, which waived certain of the “Change in Control” provisions in the Amended Employment\nAgreement, the Company remeasured the expense related to the Award Shares and Cash Payment that would be recognized in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination under the Amended Employment Agreement, as amended by the Second\nAmendment, and the expense was determined to be approximately $479.7 million.\nAs of June 29, 2024, the Company had severance plan participation agreements with six executive officers. The participation agreements (the Agreements) are\ngoverned by the terms and conditions of the Company’s 2007 Severance Protection Plan (the Severance Plan), which became effective on July 19, 2007 and\nwhich was amended effective December 31, 2008.\nUnder each of the Agreements, the applicable executive officer may be entitled to receive certain salary, equity, medical and life insurance benefits if he is\nterminated by the Company without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason under certain circumstances. Each executive officer is also\nrequired to give the Company six months’ advance notice of his resignation under certain circumstances.\n42\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nWillow Cross-Licensing Agreement Provisions\nThe Company’s Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow contains annual minimum aggregate royalty obligations for use of the rainbow® licensed technology.\nThe current annual minimum royalty obligation is $5.0 million. Upon a change in control (as defined in the Willow Licensing Agreement) of the Company or\nWillow: (i) all rights to the “Masimo” trademark will be assigned to Willow if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use “Masimo” as a company name and\ntrademark; (ii) the option to license technology developed by Willow for use in blood glucose monitoring will be deemed automatically exercised and a\n$2.5 million license fee for this technology will become immediately payable to Willow; and (iii) the minimum aggregate annual royalties payable to Willow\nfor carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin and/or glucose measurements will increase to $15.0 million per year\nuntil the exclusivity period of the agreement ends, plus up to $2.0 million for each additional vital sign measurement with no maximum ceiling for non-vital\nsign measurements.\nPurchase Commitments\nPursuant to contractual obligations with vendors, the Company had $271.7 million of purchase commitments as of June 29, 2024 that are expected to be\npurchased within one year. These purchase commitments have been made for certain inventory items in order to secure sufficient levels of those items, other\ncritical inventory and manufacturing supplies, and to achieve better pricing.\nIn addition, the Company has certain purchase commitments related to its purchase of a property in Vancouver, British Columbia. For additional information,\nsee Note 8, “Property and Equipment, net”.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may provide bank guarantees to support government hospital tenders in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of\nJune 29, 2024, the Company had approximately $5.0 million in outstanding unsecured bank guarantees.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company also provides limited indemnification within its various customer contracts whereby the Company indemnifies the\nparties to whom it sells its products with respect to potential infringement of intellectual property, and against bodily injury caused by a defective Company\nproduct. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the\nCompany’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had not incurred any significant costs related to\ncontractual indemnification of its customers.\nFee Agreements\nOn January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a one year alternative fee agreement (Fee Agreement) with respect to certain on-going legal fees and costs\ncharged by a vendor. The Fee Agreement imposes certain limits on a quarterly and annual basis for actual legal fees incurred by the vendor that are payable\nbased on work performed related to litigation matters against Apple (see the heading “Litigation” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” for further\ndetails). If the vendor is successful in obtaining a favorable judgement for the Company on any claim or counterclaim after exhaustion or dismissal of any\nappeals, or upon settlement resulting in monetary consideration to the Company, the vendor will be paid a success fee equal to three times the amount of the\nexcess of the annual legal fee limit within 60 days after entry of a judgement or the effective date of any settlement. Amounts due to the vendor under this Fee\nAgreement will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn connection with the potential separation of the Company’s consumer business, the Company entered into contingent or discretionary fee agreements with\nvarious service providers, advisors and consultants. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the contingent fees due under these agreements at this time.\nAmounts due will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.\nEndorsement Agreements\nThe Company entered into two endorsement agreements, effective on February 1, 2024 and April 12, 2024, respectively, with terms ranging from 18 months to\n36 months, for an approximate total commitment of $11.5 million, plus applicable taxes. One of these agreements also contains certain royalty payment\nprovisions based on sales of particular products, with a minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $0.5 million. As of June 29, 2024, the outstanding amount of\nthe obligations under these endorsement agreements was an aggregate of $9.3 million.\n43\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nConcentrations of Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss for the amount of its cash deposits with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company invests\na portion of its excess cash with major financial institutions. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had $129.6 million of bank balances, of which $9.1 million was\ncovered by either the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit or foreign countries’ deposit insurance organizations.\nThe Company’s ability to sell its healthcare products to U.S. hospitals depends in part on its relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential healthcare\ncustomers for the Company’s products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes exclusively, with medical\nsupply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members. During the three\nmonths ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, revenue from the sale of the Company’s healthcare products to customers that are members of GPOs\napproximated 59.8% and 58.5% of healthcare revenue, respectively. During the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, revenue from the sale of the\nCompany’s healthcare products to customers that are members of GPOs approximated 58.2% and 54.1% of healthcare revenue, respectively.\nFor the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company had sales through one just-in-time healthcare distributor that represented 20.8% and\n12.0% of consolidated revenue, respectively. For the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, the Company had sales through one just-in-time\nhealthcare distributor that represented 18.5% and 10.3% of consolidated revenue, respectively.\nFor each of the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, there were no revenue concentrations for the Company’s non-healthcare business.\nAs of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023, one healthcare customer represented 10.8% and 18.1%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated accounts\nreceivable balance. The receivable balance related to such healthcare customer is fully secured by a letter of credit.\nAs of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023, there were no customer concentration risks associated with the Company’s non-healthcare business.\nLitigation\nOn January 9, 2020, the Company filed a complaint against Apple Inc. (Apple) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for\ninfringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation, and for ownership and correction of inventorship of a number of Apple patents listing\none of its former employees as an inventor. The Company is seeking damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment regarding ownership of the Apple\npatents. Apple filed petitions for Inter Partes review (IPR) of the asserted patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO instituted IPR of the\nasserted patents. On October 13, 2020, the District Court stayed the patent infringement claims pending completion of the IPR proceedings. In the IPR\nproceedings, one or more of the challenged claims of three of the asserted patents were found valid. The challenged claims of nine of the asserted patents were\nfound invalid. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed all the IPR decisions except it reversed a finding of invalidity for certain\ndependent claims of one Masimo patent. From April 4, 2023 through May 1, 2023, the District Court held a jury trial on the trade secret, ownership, and\ninventorship claims. The District Court granted Apple’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on certain trade secrets and denied the remainder of Apple’s\nmotion. On May 1, 2023, the District Court declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The stay of the patent infringement\nclaims has been lifted and the District Court scheduled a trial on all remaining claims beginning on November 5, 2024.\n44\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple for infringement of a number of other\npatents. The Company filed an amended complaint on July 12, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the ITC issued a Notice of Institution of Investigation on the\nasserted patents. From June 6, 2022 to June 10, 2022, the ITC conducted an evidentiary hearing. In July and August 2022, Apple filed petitions for IPR of the\nasserted patents in the PTO. On January 10, 2023, a United States Administrative Law Judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Apple violated Section 337 of the\nTariff Act of 1930 (Section 337), as amended, by importing and selling within the United States certain Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry\nfunctionality and components, which infringe one of the Company’s pulse oximeter patents. On January 24, 2023, the United States Administrative Law Judge\nfurther recommended that the ITC issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order on certain Apple Watches. On October 26, 2023, the ITC issued a\nNotice of Final Determination finding a violation of Section 337 by Apple. The ITC determined that the appropriate form of relief is a Limited Exclusion Order\n(LEO) prohibiting the unlicensed entry of infringing wearable electronic devices with light-based pulse oximetry functionality manufactured by or on behalf of\nApple, and a Cease and Desist Order (CDO). The LEO and CDO went into effect after the 60-day Presidential review period expired. The LEO and CDO are\ncurrently in effect. Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit is pending. On January 30, 2023, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings for the Company’s\npulse oximeter patents that the ITC ruled were infringed. With respect to the other patents asserted at the ITC, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings\nfor one patent and instituted IPR proceedings for two patents in January and February 2023. In the IPR proceedings, one or more of the challenged claims were\nfound valid, while others were found invalid. The time period for appeal is pending. On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Exclusion\nOrder Enforcement Branch issued a ruling letter allowing importation of certain Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature disabled.\nOn October 20, 2022, Apple filed two complaints against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Masimo W1™\nwatch infringes six utility and four design patents. Apple is seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December 12, 2022, the Company counterclaimed for\nmonopolization, attempted monopolization, false advertising (and related causes of action) and infringement of ten patents. The Company is seeking damages\nand injunctive relief. On May 5, 2023, the Court ordered that the two cases be coordinated through the pre-trial stage. The Court held a case management\nconference in March 2024. The Court scheduled a trial on Apple’s patent claims and a portion of Masimo’s antitrust counterclaims to begin on October 21,\n2024. The Company intends to vigorously pursue all of its claims against Apple and believes the Company has good and substantial defenses to Apple’s claims,\nbut there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn August 22, 2023, a putative class action complaint was filed by Sergio Vazquez against the Company and members of its management alleging violations of\nthe federal securities laws. On November 14, 2023, the court appointed Boston Retirement System, Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund-Defined\nBenefit Plan, and Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund-Retirement Income Plan 1987 as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint on February 12, 2024. The amended complaint alleges that the Company and members of its management, from May 4, 2022 through August 8,\n2023, disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts relating to the performance of its healthcare business\nand the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on April 29, 2024. Briefing on the\nmotion is scheduled to conclude by July 26, 2024. The Company believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claims in the amended complaint, but\nthere is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn May 1, 2024, a purported stockholder, Linda McClellan filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against\ncertain of the Company’s current and former executives and directors, and the Company as nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that\nthe defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company by allowing or permitting false or misleading statements to be disseminated regarding the\nperformance of the Company’s healthcare business and the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The complaint also asserts causes of\naction for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.§ 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, aiding and abetting\nbreach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.\nThe Company received a subpoena from the Department of Justice (DOJ) dated February 21, 2024 seeking documents and information related to the\nCompany’s Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including information relating to complaints surrounding the products and the Company’s decision to recall select\nRad-G® products in 2024.\nThe Company received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, dated March 25, 2024, seeking\ndocuments and information related to customer returns of the Company’s Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including returns related to the Company’s recall of\nselect Rad-G® products in 2024.\n45\nTable of Contents\nMASIMO CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 26, 2024 seeking documents and information relating to\nallegations of potential accounting irregularities and internal control deficiencies from employees within the Company’s accounting department.\nWith respect to each of the subpoenas and the investigative demand described above, the Company is cooperating with the government and may expend\nsignificant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoenas and investigative demand and any related investigation or any\nother future requests for information.\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company commenced litigation against Politan Capital Management LP and certain of its affiliates (Politan), including Mr. Koffey and\nMs. Brennan, members of our Board, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking, among other things, an order declaring\nthat Politan’s proxy materials for the Company’s upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (2024 Annual Meeting) violate Section 14(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, an order enjoining Politan from voting any proxies received by means of Politan’s misleading proxy material, an\norder invalidating any proxies Politan or other persons acting in concert with it obtained pursuant to the misleading proxy material and an injunction requiring\nPolitan to correct material misstatements and omissions in Politan’s proxy materials for the 2024 Annual Meeting. The complaint also alleges, among other\nthings, that Mr. Koffey has assisted plaintiff’s counsel in separate litigation against the Company’s interests and in breach of his fiduciary duties to the\nCompany’s stockholders and that Mr. Koffey and Ms. Brennan breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by providing false or misleading information\nand omitting material facts to the Company’s stockholders through Politan’s proxy materials. On July 19, 2024, the Company filed a motion for preliminary\ninjunction and request for expedited discovery, which the District Court granted. The District Court will hear argument on the preliminary injunction motion on\nSeptember 9, 2024.\nOn July 17, 2024, Politan commenced litigation against the Company, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek, members of the Board, in the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware alleging that Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by moving the date of\nthe 2024 Annual Meeting from July 25, 2024 to September 19, 2024, and seeking, among other things, to have the Company set the record date and hold the\n2024 Annual Meeting as soon as possible, without further adjournment or postponement. On July 19, 2024, the Court of Chancery denied Politan’s request to\nreschedule the 2024 Annual Meeting to an earlier date. The Company believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claims in the Politan complaint, but\nthere is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nFor each of the foregoing matters, the Company is unable to determine whether any loss ultimately will occur or to estimate the range of such loss; therefore,\nno amount of loss accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in other litigation and investigations relating to claims and matters arising out of its operations in the normal\ncourse of business.

The two Denon PerL™ models are engineered with Masimo’s proprietary Adaptive\nAcoustic Technology™ (AAT™) to deliver the only earbud that puts hearing personalization at the forefront of the listening experience.\nEconomic Trends and Developments Effecting Our Business\nEconomic Trends\nThe healthcare and non-healthcare markets we operate in are highly competitive and dynamic, and experienced a number of headwinds in 2023, including but\nnot limited to inflationary pressures, interest rates volatility, rising energy costs, recessionary trends, and foreign currency fluctuations. All of these have\naffected the global economic environment, along with the healthcare facility spending trends and consumer spending behaviors which ultimately affect the\nCompany’s performance. While we experienced some short-term volatility in both our healthcare and non-healthcare segments, we are optimistic about long-\nterm growth due to our new product launches, our continued investment in expanding markets and embedding our improved technologies into our product\nportfolio.\nIn an effort to bolster our long-term financial position, during the first quarter of 2023, we initiated various cost reduction actions to better optimize our cost\nstructure with near-term revenue to enhance our operating cash flow, and improve our profitability for both segments going forward. Our initial focus was on a\nreduction of variable costs, with specific attention to eliminating cost inefficiencies in our supply chain and reducing variable labor spend and overhead costs in\nour production facilities by shifting manufacturing of certain products to lower cost locations. Through the second and third quarter of 2023, we expanded\nthese actions by streamlining operations, including the consolidation and rationalization of business activities and facilities, workforce reductions, suspension\nof incentive bonus compensation and annual salary adjustments, transfers of product lines between manufacturing facilities, and the transfer of other business\nactivities between sites. At the same time, we also revisited our revenue forecasts to reflect the current lower than expected U.S. hospital inpatient census,\nelevated sensor inventory levels at some customers due to discounting in prior quarters, and other factors that negatively affected revenues.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, our business presented solid signs of rebound with growth in our unrecognized healthcare contract revenue when compared\nto both the prior year and the prior quarter. This rebound appears to have continued moving into the first half of 2024, as our success in winning new healthcare\ncustomer contracts has continued, which is expected to translate into a meaningful source of revenue growth this year and for future years.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNon-healthcare revenues for the second quarter 2024 were within our guidance range and despite difficult conditions that are affecting discretionary consumer\nspending. In an effort to bolster headphone and earbud sales, we recently launched two new strategic endorsement partnerships for the Bowers & Wilkins™ and\nDenon™ brands that are expected to provide growth to the non-healthcare business. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nSeasonality\nEach of our business segments is individually influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory\napprovals, holiday schedules, hospital census, clinicians, nurses and hospital personnel, the timing of the influenza season, holiday seasons, consumer\npressures, fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary and recessionary pressures, consumer demand and preferences, competitors’ marketing promotions and\nsales incentives; among many other factors.\nOur healthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality of\nthe U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer elective procedures utilizing our healthcare products.\nOur non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year historically produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other quarters of\nour fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. Our promotional discounting activity may negatively impact\nour gross margin during the holiday periods and into the trailing period (depending on our annual 52/53 week fiscal year end calendar).\nOn-Going Russian-Ukraine Conflict, Israel-Palestine-Iran War\nWe continue to monitor the uncertainty from conflicts and wars in Russia, the Ukraine, Israel and Iran, with respect to ongoing business in such regions, and\nare continuing to support existing patient populations while remaining compliant with all applicable U.S. and EU sanctions and regulations, where applicable.\nWhile none of Russia, the Ukraine or Israel constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the\ncurrent scope of the conflicts in either geographic region, including the Middle East, could have an impact on our business. In the interim, order acceptance for\nRussia has been halted. For the six months ended June 29, 2024, sales derived from customers based in Russia represented an immaterial percentage of our\ntotal revenue.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWillow Laboratories, Inc.

As of June 29, 2024, we had approximately $596.0 million in working capital, of which approximately $129.6\nmillion was in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to net working capital, as of June 29, 2024, we had approximately $226.8 million of available borrowing\ncapacity (net of outstanding letters of credit) under our Credit Facility.\nWe currently maintain a Credit Facility which provides for $705.0 million of unsecured borrowings. The Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to\n$50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. Proceeds from the Credit Facility are being used for general corporate, capital investment and expenditures\nand working capital needs. For additional information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn managing our day-to-day liquidity and capital structure, we generally do not rely on foreign earnings as a source of funds. As of June 29, 2024, we had cash\ntotaling $58.7 million held outside of the U.S., of which approximately $27.3 million was accessible without additional tax cost and approximately $31.4\nmillion was accessible at an incremental estimated tax cost of up to $0.3 million. We currently have sufficient funds on-hand and cash held outside the U.S. that\nis available without additional tax cost to fund our global operations. In the event funds that are treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, we may be\nrequired to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nOur cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, market acceptance of our technologies, our continued ability to\ncommercialize new products and to create or improve our technologies and applications, expansion of our global footprint through acquisitions and/or strategic\ninvestments in technologies or technology companies, hedging and derivative activities, investments in property and equipment, the renewal of our Credit\nFacility, the impact of disruptions to the manufacturing industry supply chain for key components, inflation, repurchases of our stock under our authorized\nstock repurchase program, costs related to our domestic and international regulatory requirements and other long-term commitments and contingencies. For\nfurther details regarding our commitment and contingencies, see Note 24 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part IV,\nItem 15(a) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to\naccelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others,\nnegotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and\ncollections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial\ninstitutions.\nDespite recent acquisitions and strategic investment expenditures, we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit\nFacility, and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and capital expenditures, working capital\nrequirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12 months.\nShould we require additional funds in the future to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes, we may seek to raise such additional funds\nthrough debt financing, as well as from other sources such as through our effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-262770)\non file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. No assurance can be given that additional\nfinancing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable when required.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 29, 2024\nJune 29, July 1,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 120.3 $ 24.0\nInvesting activities (21.2) (33.5)\nFinancing activities (117.5) (40.1)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash (14.2) (1.4)\nDecrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (32.6) $ (51.0)\nOperating Activities.

Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 29, 2024 was approximately $21.2 million, consisting primarily of\napproximately $16.1 million of capitalized intangible asset costs related primarily to patent and trademark costs and license fees, approximately $15.8 million\nfor purchases of property and equipment, approximately $10.8 million from the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, and approximately $0.1\nmillion of strategic investments.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFor the six months ended July 1, 2023, cash used in investing activities was approximately $33.5 million, consisting primarily of approximately $20.4 million\nfor purchases of property and equipment, approximately $19.9 million of capitalized intangible asset costs related primarily to patent and trademark costs and\nlicense fees, and approximately $0.7 million of strategic investments, which were offset by approximately $7.5 million from escrow funds associated with a\nbusiness combination.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 29, 2024 was approximately $117.5 million, consisting primarily of\nrepayment on the line of credit of approximately $185.6 million, and withholding of shares for employee payroll taxes for vested equity awards of\napproximately $5.8 million, which were offset by proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit of approximately $64.0 million and the issuance of\ncommon stock related to employee equity awards of approximately $9.9 million.\nFor the six months ended July 1, 2023, cash used in financing activities was approximately $40.1 million, consisting primarily of repayment on the line of\ncredit of approximately $112.4 million and withholding of shares for employee payroll taxes for vested equity awards of approximately $12.7 million, which\nwere offset by proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit of approximately $79.0 million and the issuance of common stock related to employee equity\nawards of approximately $6.0 million.\nCapital Resources and Prospective Capital Requirements\nWe expect to fund our future operating, investing and financing activities through our available cash, future cash from operations, our Credit Facility and other\npotential sources of capital. In addition to funding our working capital requirements, we anticipate additional capital expenditures primarily related to\ninvestments in infrastructure growth. Possible additional uses of cash may include acquisitions of and/or strategic investments in technologies or technology\ncompanies, investments in property, repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program and continued legal defense of our\nintellectual property. However, any repurchases of common stock will be subject to numerous factors, including the availability of our common stock, general\nmarket conditions, the trading price of our common stock, availability of capital, alternative uses for capital and our financial performance. In addition, the\namount and timing of our actual investing activities will vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of capital\nexpenditures, costs of product development efforts, our timetable for infrastructure expansion, any stock repurchase activity and costs related to our domestic\nand international regulatory requirements. Despite these strategic investment requirements and potential expenditures, we anticipate that our existing cash and\ncash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facility and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing\noperating and capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12 months. We may require additional funds\nin the future to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through debt financing, as well as\nfrom other sources. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on\nterms favorable when required. For additional information related to our Credit Facility, please see Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.\nWe regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to our critical accounting policies, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, stock-based\ncompensation, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; business combinations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances,\nuncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, litigation costs and loss contingencies.\nThese estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and\nform the basis for making management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. Although we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these\nestimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. If these estimates differ significantly from actual\nresults, the impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements may be material.\nThere have been no material changes to any of our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 29, 2024.\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, which was filed with the\nSEC on February 28, 2024.\n57\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor details regarding any recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks that may arise from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations and\ninflation. We do maintain a derivative instrument for cash flow hedging, but do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or\nspeculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our cash and cash\nequivalents and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments. As\nof June 29, 2024, the carrying value of our cash equivalents approximated fair value. We manage our risk associated with interest rates fluctuations related to\ninterest expenses under our Credit Facility by engaging in hedging activities. Since July 2022, we entered into various interest rate swap contracts to hedge our\nexposure to changes in cash flows associated with our outstanding debt with variable interest rates. The interest rate swap contracts have maturities averaging\nfive years or less. See Note 17, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase or decrease our interest rate yields on our\ninvestments, interest income and credit facilities by approximately $0.1 million for each $10.0 million in interest-bearing investments and by $0.1 million for\neach additional $10.0 million of debt.\nOur ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our\nhedging strategies at that time. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately\n$0.1 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, for the quarter ended June 29, 2024 and approximately\n$1.6 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, for the six months ended June 29, 2024.\nWe sponsor multiple defined benefit pension plans covering certain international employees. The aggregate fair value of the plans’ investments was $22.9\nmillion as of June 29, 2024. The plans’ assets may be subject to market risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, which may affect the value of the plans’ assets\nand the funding of the plans.\nIncreases in interest rates globally may impact the value of pension plan assets held by us. When interest rates increase, the value of fixed income securities,\nsuch as bonds, may decrease, which can negatively impact the fair value of the pension plan assets. However, interest rate increases may also improve the\nfunded status of plan by increasing the discount rate used to measure the present value of the pension obligations and potentially decreasing our requirement to\nmake contributions to the plan. The most significant actuarial assumption affecting pension expense and pension obligations is discount rates. A hypothetical\nincrease of 100 basis point in discount rates would result in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in the projected benefit obligation. The impact of interest\nrate increases on the pension plan assets and funded status may not be predictable and may vary from period to period.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nA majority of our assets and liabilities are maintained in the United States in U.S. Dollars and a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in U.S.\nDollars. However, we also transact with foreign customers in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S.\nDollars, can vary depending on average exchange rates during a respective period. In addition, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in their respective\ncountry’s local currency, which is also their functional currency. As a result, expenses of these foreign subsidiaries, when converted into U.S. Dollars can also\nvary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as our foreign currency\ndenominated cash balances and certain intercompany transactions. In addition, other transactions between us or our subsidiaries and a third-party, denominated\nin a currency different from the functional currency, are foreign currency transactions. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these\ntransactions are also included in our statements of operations as incurred.\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe balance sheets of each of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange\nat the balance sheet date and the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average\nmonthly exchange rates applicable during the period. Any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income Our foreign currency\nexchange rate exposures are primarily with the Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Swedish Krona, the British Pound, Mexican Peso, Turkish Lira,\nAustralian Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Foreign currency exchange rates may experience significant volatility from one period to the next.\nWe do not use derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The effect of additional changes in foreign currency exchange rates\ncould have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows, depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and depending on the\ndirectional change (either a strengthening or weakening against the U.S. Dollar). We estimate that the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in\nall applicable foreign currency exchange rates from the rates in effect as of June 29, 2024 would have resulted in an estimated reduction of $9.5 million in\nreported pre-tax income for the six months ended June 29, 2024. As our foreign operations continue to grow, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate\nrisk may become more significant.\nInflation Risk\nInflation has continued to increase in the first quarter of 2024 and is expected to continue to increase for the near future. Consumer demand and discretionary\nspending continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures, which could materially impact our financial results, in particular, our consumer products and non-\nhealthcare business segment. We are unable to determine the exact impact of inflation on our global business, financial condition or results of operations during\nthe periods presented.\nIf our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our\ninability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and\nExchange Commission’s (SEC) regulations, rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nCEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange\nAct, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the\nforegoing, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nDuring the three months ended June 29, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)\nand 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information set forth in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption\n“Litigation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties\ndescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also\nimpair our business operations. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth\nprospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all\nor part of your investment. Risk factors marked with an asterisk (*) below include a substantive change from or an update to the risk factors included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\n60\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Material Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that\nwe face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this summary, and other risks that we face, can be found following this summary and should be\ncarefully considered together with all of the other information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n• We currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our Masimo SET® platform, Masimo rainbow SET® platform and related products. If these\ntechnologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\n• Some of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit our\ngrowth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n(cid:0)(cid:135)\nOur ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® and our licensed rainbow®\ntechnology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor\nLaboratories, Inc., which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• We depend on our domestic and international original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote\nsufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\n• If we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our healthcare products would decline.\n• Inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our healthcare products, or for procedures using our\nhealthcare products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\n• *The loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer, or any non-payment, non-\nperformance or disagreement or dispute with any customer or distributor could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\n• Counterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n• Competition and other conflicts with our non-healthcare distribution partners could harm our business and operating results.\n• If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our\ncompetitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\n• If third-parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling\ncertain products.\n• *We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate litigation to\nprotect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management’s attention from implementing our\nbusiness strategy.\n• Our failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current, upgraded\nor new healthcare products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\n• If our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or\nserious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and other applicable laws, and may need to initiate voluntary or mandatory\ncorrective actions, such as the recall of our healthcare products.\n• Promotion of our healthcare products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\n• *The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving. Many of the laws and regulations\nin this area are subject to uncertain interpretation, and our failure to comply could result in claims, penalties or increased costs or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\n• We may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties if we\nare unable to fully comply with these laws.\n• We may experience conflicts of interest with Willow with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\n61\nTable of Contents\n• We will be required to assign to Willow and pay Willow for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring of\nnon-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®.\n• In the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Willow grants a license to rainbow® technology to a third-party, our\nbusiness would be adversely affected.\n• Rights provided to Willow in the Cross-Licensing Agreement may impede a change in control of our company.\n• If we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to customers.\n• *Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions or separations of businesses and strategic investments or joint ventures, could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses and their employees successfully into our existing\noperations or achieve the desired results of our initiatives.\n• *Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or generate\nrevenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial\nresults.\n• Our Credit Facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\n• We have incurred impairment charges for other intangible assets, and may incur further impairment charges in the future, which would negatively impact\nour operating results.\n• We may need additional capital and failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business and\ndevelop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\n• Concentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from\ninfluencing significant corporate decisions.\n• We may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately plan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet our\npublicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results.\n• Our corporate documents, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent\nattempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\n• *Shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, disrupt our business, result in a proxy contest or litigation and impact our stock price.\n• Exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or employees.\n62\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Revenues\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our Masimo SET® platform, Masimo rainbow SET® platform and related products. If\nthese technologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nOur healthcare business is highly dependent upon the continued success and market acceptance of our proprietary Masimo SET® and Masimo rainbow SET®\ntechnologies that serve as the basis of our primary healthcare product offerings. Continued market acceptance of products incorporating these technologies will\ndepend upon us continuing to provide evidence to the medical community that our products are cost-effective and offer significantly improved performance\ncompared to conventional pulse oximeters. Healthcare providers that currently have significant investments in competitive pulse oximetry products may be\nreluctant to purchase our products. If hospitals and other healthcare providers do not believe our Masimo SET® and Masimo rainbow SET® platforms are cost-\neffective, safe or more accurate or reliable than competitive pulse oximetry products, they may not buy our healthcare products in sufficient quantities to enable\nus to generate revenue growth from the sale of these products. In addition, allegations regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products, whether or not\nsubstantiated, may impair or impede the acceptance of our products.\nSome of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit\nour growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our noninvasive measurement technologies are considered disruptive. These technologies have performance levels that we believe are acceptable for\nmany clinical environments but may be insufficient in others. In addition, these technologies may perform better in some patients and settings than others. Over\ntime, we hope to continue to improve the performance of these technologies and educate the clinical community on how to properly evaluate them. If we are\nsuccessful in these endeavors, we expect these technologies will become more useful in more environments and will become more widely adopted. Our product\nportfolio continues to expand, and we are investing significant resources to enter into, and in some cases create, new markets for our products. For example,\nour acquisition of Sound United expanded our business and product strategy to additionally focus on non-healthcare products to integrate with our successful\nmedical technology. See the risk factor with the heading “Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound\nUnited could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could\nadversely affect our business, reputation or financial results” for additional risks related to this expansion of our business.\nWe are continuing to invest in sales and marketing resources to achieve market acceptance of our products, but are unable to guarantee that our technologies\nwill achieve general market acceptance.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our healthcare products will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• perceived clinical benefits from our products;\n• perceived cost effectiveness of our products;\n• perceived safety and effectiveness of our products;\n• reimbursement available through government and private healthcare programs for using some of our products; and\n• introduction and acceptance of competing products or technologies.\nFurther, market acceptance of our non-healthcare products will depend on certain additional factors, including but not limited to:\n• perceived quality of our non-healthcare brands and technology;\n• our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand and maintain manufacturing capacity to meet such demand;\n• our ability to introduce new innovative products that align with rapidly changing consumer tastes; and\n• implementation of pricing and marketing strategies that drive consumer adoption without eroding our premium market position.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance or if our customers prefer our competitors’ products, our potential revenue growth would be limited, which\nwould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n63\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® and our licensed rainbow®\ntechnology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor\nLaboratories, Inc., which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 1998, we have been a party to a cross-licensing agreement with Willow (as amended, the Cross-Licensing Agreement), under which we granted Willow:\n• an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET® technology owned by us, including all improvements to this\ntechnology, for the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters and to develop and sell devices incorporating Masimo SET® for monitoring non-vital signs\nparameters in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than by a professional medical caregiver,\nwhich we refer to as the “Willow Market”; and\n• a non-exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET® technology owned by us for measurement of vital signs\nin the “Willow Market”.\nNon-vital signs measurements consist of body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements, including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide,\nmethemoglobin, blood glucose, hemoglobin and bilirubin. Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we are only permitted to sell devices utilizing Masimo SET®\nfor the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters in markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver, including, but not\nlimited to, hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers, rather than by a patient or pharmacist, which we refer to as the “Masimo Market”.\nAccordingly, our ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET® is limited. In particular,\nour inability to expand beyond the “Masimo Market” may limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nPursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we have licensed from Willow the right to make and distribute products in the “Masimo Market” that utilize\nrainbow® technology for certain noninvasive measurements. As a result, the opportunity to expand the market for our products incorporating rainbow®\ntechnology is also limited, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nWe depend on our domestic and international original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote\nsufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent upon our domestic and international OEM partners for a portion of our revenue through their marketing, selling and\ndistribution of certain of their products that incorporate our technologies. Although we expect that our OEM partners will accept and actively market, sell and\ndistribute products that incorporate our technologies, they may not do so. Because products that incorporate our technologies may represent a relatively small\npercentage of business for some of our OEM partners, they may have less incentive to promote these products over other products that do not incorporate these\ntechnologies.\nIn addition, some of our OEM partners offer products that compete with ours and also may be involved in intellectual property disputes with us. Therefore, we\ncannot guarantee that our OEM partners, or any company that may acquire any of our OEM partners, will vigorously promote products incorporating our\ntechnologies. The failure of our OEM partners to successfully market, sell or distribute products incorporating our technologies, the termination of OEM\nagreements, the loss of OEM partners or the inability to enter into future OEM partnership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our healthcare products would decline.\nOur ability to sell our healthcare products to hospitals depends, in part, on our relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential customers for our products\nare members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts with medical supply manufacturers and distributors that may include provisions for\nsole sourcing and bundling, which generally reduce the choices available to member hospitals.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThese negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, the GPO’s members may be less likely\nor unlikely to purchase our products. If a GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer’s\nproducts, we may be prohibited from making sales to members of such GPO for the duration of such contractual arrangement. Shipments of our pulse oximetry\nproducts to customers that are members of GPOs represent approximately 95% of our U.S. healthcare product sales. Our failure to renew our contracts with\nGPOs may cause us to lose market share in our healthcare business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, if we are unable to develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer and our opportunities to grow\nour revenues and business would be harmed.\nInadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our healthcare products, or for procedures using\nour healthcare products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\nSales of our healthcare products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private healthcare payers. The lack of\nadequate coverage and reimbursement for our healthcare products or the procedures in which our healthcare products are used may deter customers from\npurchasing our products.\nWe cannot guarantee that governmental or third-party payers will reimburse or begin reimbursing a customer for the cost of our healthcare products or the\nprocedures in which our healthcare products are used. For example, some insurance carriers have issued policies denying coverage for transcutaneous\nhemoglobin measurement on the grounds that the technology is investigational in the outpatient setting. Other payers are continuing to investigate our products\nto determine if they will provide reimbursement for the use of such products. In addition, we may incur significant expenses to generate clinical data to\ndemonstrate not only the safety and efficacy, but also the cost-effectiveness of our products in order to obtain favorable reimbursement policies from payers.\nThese trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current and future healthcare products, hinder our ability to obtain market adoption, cause a\ndecrease in the size of the market or potentially increase competition, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe do not control payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to\nexplore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called “pay-for-performance” programs implemented by various\npublic government healthcare programs and private third-party payers, and expansion of payment bundling initiatives, and other such methods that shift\nmedical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our current products or products we develop in the future.\nOutside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary by country. These systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising healthcare costs and control\nhealthcare expenditures as those in the U.S. In addition, as economies of emerging markets develop, these countries may implement changes in their healthcare\ndelivery and payment systems. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U.S. are not obtained, sales of our products outside of\nthe U.S. may be adversely affected.\n*Our healthcare customers may reduce, delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors, such as lower hospital census levels or third-party\nguidelines, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur healthcare customers are facing growing levels of uncertainties, including variations in overall hospital census for paying patients and the impact of such\ncensus variations on hospital budgets. As a result, many hospitals are reevaluating their entire cost structure, including the amount of capital they allocate to\nmedical device technologies and products. In addition, certain of our products, including our rainbow® measurements such as carbon monoxide,\nmethemoglobin and hemoglobin, that are sold with upfront license fees and more complex and expensive sensors, could also be impacted by hospital budget\nreductions. Any reductions in capital spending budgets by hospitals could have a significant negative impact on our OEM customers who, due to their\ntraditionally larger capital equipment sales model, could see declines in purchases from their hospital customers. This, in turn, could reduce our board sales to\nour OEM customers.\nFrom time to time, states and other local regulatory authorities may issue guidelines regarding the appropriate scope and use of our products. For example,\nsome of our noninvasive monitoring devices may be subject to authorization by individual states as part of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) scope of\npractice procedures. A lack of inclusion into scope of practice procedures may limit adoption of our products.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, increases in demand resulting from global medical crises, such as the increase in demand we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nbe short lived. If the increased demand results in a stockpiling of our healthcare products by, or excess inventory at, our customers, future orders may be\ndelayed or canceled until such on-hand inventory is consumed. We may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately\nplan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results. For example, during\nthe second half of 2023, customers maintained elevated levels of single-patient use sensors and consumables in inventory due to the softer demand and lower\nhospital census, which had an adverse impact on our second half of 2023 healthcare revenue. Continued stockpiling or excess inventory as a result of lower\nhospital census in future quarters could also negatively impact our healthcare revenue.\n*The loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer, or any non-payment, non-\nperformance or disagreement or dispute with any customer or distributor could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\nOur healthcare business has a concentration of OEM, distributor and direct customers. For example, sales to one just-in-time distributor represented 10% or\nmore of our consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2024. There were no revenue concentrations for our non-healthcare business, which represented\n10% or more of our consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2024.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will retain our current customers, groups of customers or distributors, that they will maintain their current or\nforecasted demand for our products, or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future. If for any reason we were to lose our ability\nto sell to a specific group or class of customers or through a distributor, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue or loss of market share, which\nwould adversely impact our operating results.\nOur revenues could also be negatively affected by any rebates, discounts or fees that are required by, or offered to, GPOs and customers, including wholesalers\nor distributors. Additionally, one just-in-time distributor of our healthcare products has recently demanded higher fees, which we have agreed to pay in order to\ncontinue to offer products to our customers through this distributor. Specifically, in February 2024, we were notified by this distributor of its intent to terminate\nour distribution agreement as a result of our refusal to increase distribution fees. While we were ultimately able to reach an agreement with this distributor, the\nloss of any large customer or distributor, an increase in distributor fees, or the risks associated with selling directly to our customers could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any material non-payment or non-performance by any of our customers or distributors, a significant disagreement or dispute with any of our\ncustomers or distributors, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of our customers or distributors, the early\ntermination of any agreements with any of our customers or distributors, or any other event significantly negatively impacting our contractual relationship with\nany of our customers or distributors or any losses we may incur from any disagreements or disputed transactions and the resulting impact on the timing and\namount of any payments, or any delayed or withheld payments, due from our customers or distributors could adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nCounterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that other entities are manufacturing and selling counterfeit Masimo sensors. In addition, certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting\nour used single-patient-use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing, repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals. These counterfeit and third-party\nreprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors. Our experience with both these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessed sensors\nis that they provide inferior performance, increased sensor consumption, reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems. Notwithstanding these\nlimitations, some of our customers have indicated a willingness to purchase some of their sensor requirements from these counterfeit manufacturers and third-\nparty reprocessors in an effort to reduce their sensor costs.\nThese counterfeit and reprocessed sensors have led and may continue to lead to confusion with our genuine Masimo products, have reduced and may continue\nto reduce our revenue, and, in some cases, have harmed and may continue to harm our reputation if customers conclude incorrectly that these counterfeit or\nreprocessed sensors are original Masimo sensors.\nIn addition, we have expended a significant amount of time and expense investigating issues caused by counterfeit and reprocessed sensors, troubleshooting\nproblems stemming from such sensors, educating customers about why counterfeit and reprocessed sensors do not perform to their expectations, enforcing our\nproprietary rights against the counterfeit manufacturers and reprocessors, and enforcing our contractual rights.\n66\nTable of Contents\nIn response to these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessors, we have incorporated X-Cal® technology into certain products to ensure our customers get\nthe performance they expect by using genuine Masimo sensors and that such sensors do not continue to be used beyond their useful life. However, some\ncustomers may object to the X-Cal® technology, potentially resulting in the loss of customers and revenues.\nWe also offer our own Masimo reprocessed sensors, which meet the same performance specifications as our new Masimo sensors, to our customers.\nReprocessed sensors sold by us are also offered at a lower price and, therefore, may reduce certain customer demand for our new sensors. As a result, increased\nsales of our own Masimo reprocessed sensors may result in lower revenues, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nCompetition and other conflicts with our non-healthcare distribution partners could harm our business and operating results.\nSeveral of our existing non-healthcare products compete, and future products may compete, with the product offerings of some of our significant channel and\ndistribution partners. These partners may choose to market and promote their own products over ours or could cease or reduce selling or promoting our\nproducts. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our non-healthcare products, or increased competition from our distribution partners for available\nshelf or website placement, especially during peak retail sales periods, could adversely affect our non-healthcare business. In addition, the expansion of our\ndirect-to-consumer channel in our non-healthcare business through our brand websites could increase our competition with our channel partners and cause\nthese partners to reduce their purchases of our non-healthcare products. Conflicts in our sales channels could arise and cause channel partners to divert\nresources away from the promotion and sale of our products. Any of these situations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our\ncompetitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. Our utilization of patent protection, trade secrets\nand a combination of copyright and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual\nproperty afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage.\nCertain of our patents related to our technologies have begun to expire. Upon the expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we generally lose some of our\nrights to exclude competitors from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases and several laws have been enacted that, in certain situations, potentially\nnarrow the scope of patent protection available and weaken the rights of patent owners. As a result, we believe large technology companies may be pursuing an\n“efficient infringement” strategy, having concluded that it is cheaper to infringe third-party intellectual property rights than to acquire, license or otherwise\nrespect them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional patents on commercially desirable improvements, that such additional\npatents will adequately protect our innovations or offset the effect of expiring patents, or that competitors will not be able to design around our patents.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, third-parties have challenged, and may continue to challenge, our issued patents through procedures such as Inter-Partes Review (IPR). In many\nIPR challenges, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) cancels or significantly narrows issued patent claims. IPR challenges could increase the\nuncertainties and costs associated with the maintenance, enforcement and defense of our issued and future patents and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the\ngovernmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to\nobtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future. For example, the complexity and uncertainty of European\npatent laws have also increased in recent years. In Europe, in June 2023, a new unitary patent system was introduced, which will significantly impact European\npatents, including those granted before the introduction of the system. Under the unitary patent system, after a European patent is granted, the patent proprietor\ncan request unitary effect, thereby getting a European patent with unitary effect (Unitary Patent). Each Unitary Patent is subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnitary Patent Court (UPC). As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Patents granted\nbefore the implementation of the UPC will have the option of opting out of the jurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries.\nPatents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC may be potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-based revocation challenge that, if successful, could\ninvalidate the patent in all countries who are signatories to the UPC. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of the new unitary patent system.\nWe also utilize unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and often rely on confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements\nwith our employees, OEM partners, independent distributors and consultants to protect such unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. However, such\nagreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or\nother breaches of the agreements, or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary\ninformation.\nWe rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to our brands and the names of some of our products. Common law trademarks\nprovide less protection than registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf third-parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue\nselling certain products.\nSearching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection,\nwhich may not be publicly-available information, or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our searches. In addition, some of our\nemployees were previously employed at our competitors. We may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed, or that we have used, trade secrets or\nother proprietary information of our employees’ former employers. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third-parties’ intellectual property rights may\nnot always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us, even those without merit, could:\n• be expensive and time-consuming to defend and result in payment of significant damages to third-parties;\n• force us to stop making or selling products that incorporate the intellectual property;\n• require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, product candidates and technologies;\n• require us to enter into royalty agreements that would increase the costs of our products;\n• require us to indemnify third-parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement\nclaims;\n• divert the attention of our management and other key employees; and\n• result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims\nare resolved;\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new patents obtained by our\ncompetitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced.\n68\nTable of Contents\n*We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate\nlitigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management’s attention from\nimplementing our business strategy.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends, in part, on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies, defending our patents and\npreserving our trade secrets. We were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent positions related to some of our pulse oximetry signal\nprocessing patents that resulted in various settlements. We believe some of the new market entrants in the healthcare and monitoring space, including some of\nthe world’s largest technology companies, and some consumer audio companies may be infringing our intellectual property, and we may be required to engage\nin additional litigation to protect our intellectual property in the future. In addition, we believe that certain individuals who previously held high level technical\nand clinical positions with us misappropriated our intellectual property for the benefit of themselves and other companies. For example, on January 9, 2020, we\ninitiated litigation against Apple Inc. for infringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation and for ownership and correction of\ninventorship of a number of Apple Inc. patents that list one of our former employees as an inventor. For additional information on the current status of our\nlitigation with Apple Inc., please see Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the\nattention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be successful or\nadequate to protect our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in January 2024, we entered into a one year alternative fee agreement (Fee Agreement) with\nrespect to certain on-going legal fees and costs incurred by a vendor. The Fee Agreement imposes certain limits on a quarterly and annual basis for actual legal\nfees incurred by the vendor that are payable based on work performed related to litigation matters against Apple. If the vendor is successful in obtaining a\nfavorable judgement for us on any claim or counterclaim after exhaustion or dismissal of any appeals, or upon settlement resulting in monetary consideration to\nus, the vendor will be paid a success fee equal to three times the amount of the excess of the annual legal fee limit within 60 days after entry of a judgement or\nthe effective date of any settlement. Therefore, to the extent that we may be successful in our litigation against Apple, we could be required to make a payments\nto this vendor in excess of the actual amount of fees incurred in connection with our litigation against Apple.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current,\nupgraded or new healthcare products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market in the U.S. must first undergo premarket review pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act (FDCA) by receiving clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, receiving clearance through the de novo classification review process or\nobtaining approval of a premarket approval (PMA) application. Even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) may clear or approve our products only for limited indications for use. Additionally, the FDA may not grant 510(k) clearance on a timely\nbasis, if at all, for new products or new uses that we propose for Masimo SET® or licensed rainbow® technology.\nThe traditional FDA 510(k) clearance process for our medical devices has generally taken between four to nine months. However, our more recent experience\nand interactions with the FDA, along with information we have received from other medical device manufacturers, suggests that, in some cases, the FDA is\nrequiring applicants to provide additional or different information and data for 510(k) clearance than it had previously required, and that the FDA may not rely\non approaches that it had previously accepted to support 510(k) clearance. As a result, FDA 510(k) clearance can be delayed for our products in some cases.\nTo support our product applications to the FDA, we frequently are required to conduct clinical testing of our products. Such clinical testing must be conducted\nin compliance with FDA requirements pertaining to human research. Among other requirements, we must obtain informed consent from study subjects and\napproval by institutional review boards before such studies may begin. We must also comply with other FDA requirements such as monitoring, record-keeping,\nreporting and the submission of information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. In addition, if\nthe study involves a significant risk device, we are required to obtain the FDA’s approval of the study under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE).\nCompliance with these requirements can require significant time and resources. In addition, public health emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances\nmay disrupt the conduct of our clinical trials. If the FDA determines that we have not complied with such requirements, the FDA may refuse to consider the\ndata to support our applications or may initiate enforcement actions.\n69\nTable of Contents\nEven though 510(k) clearances have been obtained, if safety or effectiveness problems are identified with our products, we may need to initiate a recall of such\nproducts. Furthermore, our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be denied 510(k) clearance and be required to undergo the more\nburdensome PMA or de novo classification review processes. The process of obtaining a de novo classification or PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy\nand uncertain than the process for obtaining 510(k) clearance.\nDe novo classification review generally takes six months to one year from the time of submission of the de novo request, although it can take longer. Approval\nof a PMA generally takes one year from the time of submission of the PMA, but may be longer.\nSome of our products or product features may not be subject to the 510(k) process and/or other regulatory requirements in accordance with specific FDA\nguidance and policies, such as the FDA guidance related to mobile medical applications. In additions, some of our products or product features may not be\nsubject to device regulation pursuant to Section 520(o) of the FDCA, which excludes certain software functions from the statutory definition of a device. If the\nFDA changes its policies or concludes that our marketing of these products is not in accordance with its current policies and/or Section 520(o) of the FDCA,\nwe may be required to seek clearance or approval of these devices through the 510(k), de novo classification review or PMA processes.\nThe failure of our OEM partners to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our healthcare technologies could\nhave a negative impact on our revenue.\nOur healthcare OEM partners are required to obtain their own FDA clearances in the U.S. for most products incorporating our technologies. The FDA\nclearances we have obtained may not make it easier for our OEM partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies, or the FDA may\nnot grant clearances on a timely basis, if at all, for any future products incorporating our technologies that our OEM partners propose to market.\nWe are subject to ongoing postmarket regulation by regulatory authorities and if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements we could be\nsubject to enforcement actions, penalties or other harm to our business.\nOur healthcare products, along with the manufacturing processes, labeling and promotional activities for those products, are subject to continual review and\nperiodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Among other requirements, we and certain of our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA’s\nQuality System Regulation (QSR), which governs the methods and documentation of the design, control testing, production, component suppliers control,\nquality assurance, complaint handling, labeling control, packaging, storage and shipping of our healthcare products. The FDA enforces the QSR through\nannounced and unannounced inspections. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses.\nIn addition to the FDA, from time to time we are subject to inspections by the California Food and Drug Branch, international regulatory authorities and other\nsimilar governmental agencies. The standards used by these regulatory authorities are complex and may differ from those used by the FDA.\nFailure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies or failure to adequately\nrespond to any FDA Form 483 observations, any California Food and Drug Branch notices of violation or any similar reports could result in, among other\nthings, any of the following:\n• be warning letters or untitled letters issued by the FDA;\n• fines, civil penalties, in rem forfeiture proceedings, injunctions, consent decrees and criminal prosecution;\n• import alerts;\n• unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n• delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products;\n• withdrawals or suspensions of clearance or approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n• product recalls or seizures;\n• orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n• interruptions of production or inability to export to certain foreign countries; and\n• operating restrictions.\n70\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, many of our healthcare and non-healthcare products are subject to various laws, regulations and legal requirements, including those governing\nconsumer protection, product import and export, hazardous materials usage and discharge, product related energy consumption, electrical safety, wireless\nemissions, e-commerce, packaging and recycling. Compliance with these requirements, which vary widely depending on jurisdiction, is time consuming and\nexpensive.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable legal requirements, it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory authorizations in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe currently market and intend to continue to market our products internationally. Outside of the U.S., we can generally market our healthcare products only if\nwe receive a marketing authorization (and/or meet certain pre-marketing requirements) and, in some cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory\nauthorities. The regulatory registration/licensing process varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional or different product testing than\nrequired to obtain FDA clearance. FDA clearance does not ensure new product registration/licensing by foreign regulatory authorities, and we may be unable to\nobtain foreign regulatory registration/licensing on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn addition, clearance by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure clearance by any other foreign regulatory authority or by the FDA. If we fail to\nreceive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, foreign regulatory requirements may change from time to time, which could adversely affect our ability to market new products, and/or continue\nto market existing products, internationally. Certain significant changes in the international regulatory landscape have recently taken place or will take place in\nthe near future. These include the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), which came into effect on May 26, 2021 and a regulatory\nregime in the UK effective since January 1, 2021 as a result of the UK’s exit from the EU (Brexit).\nModifications to our marketed medical devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing\nor to recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nWe have made modifications to our medical devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future. Any modification to a medical device\nthat is cleared by the FDA that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that could constitute a major change in its intended use would require a\nnew clearance or approval and certain modifications to devices cleared or approved by foreign regulatory authorities may also require a new clearance or\napproval.\nWe may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability\nto introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nFor device modifications that we conclude do not require a new regulatory clearance or approval, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the\nmodified devices if the government agency disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications. This could have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or\nserious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and other applicable laws, and may need to initiate voluntary or mandatory\ncorrective actions, such as the recall of our healthcare products.\nRegulatory agencies in many countries require us to report anytime our healthcare products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a\nway that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. For example, under the FDA medical device reporting regulations, we are required to\nreport to the FDA any incident in which a product of ours may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product of ours\nmalfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing\nmedical devices on the market in the EU are legally required to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices produced or sold by the\nmanufacturer to the relevant authority in those jurisdictions where any such incident occurred.\n71\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of our commercialized healthcare products in the event of material\ndeficiencies or defects in, for example, design, labeling or manufacture. The FDA must find that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause\nserious adverse health consequences or death in order to require a recall. The standard for recalling deficient products may be different in foreign jurisdictions.\nManufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency is found in a device or they become aware of a safety issue involving\na marketed product. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures,\nmanufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nWe may initiate certain field actions, such as a product correction or removal of our products in the future. In addition, third- parties that commercialize\nproducts incorporating our technologies may initiate similar actions or product corrections. Any correction or removal initiated by us to reduce a health risk\nposed by our device, or to remedy a violation of the FDCA or other regulations caused by the device that may present a risk to health, must be reported to the\nFDA. If the FDA subsequently determines that a report was required for a correction or removal of our products that we did not believe required a report, we\ncould be subject to enforcement actions.\nIn addition, our non-healthcare products, including components we source from third parties, may be found to have design or manufacturing defects. Such\ndefects may result in additional costs for product modifications, voluntary or mandated product recalls or other liabilities resulting from product malfunctions.\nFor example, defects in our audio products may result in overheating or electrical shock, creating a risk of personal injury or property damage.\nAny recalls or corrections of our products or third-party products that incorporate our technologies, or enforcement actions would divert managerial and\nfinancial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given our dependence upon patient,\nphysician and consumer perceptions, any negative publicity associated with any recalls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nIn August 2023, we decided to conduct a voluntary recall of select Rad-G® products in connection with an issue that can result in an unintentional change in the\npower state of the device. On February 14, 2024, we initiated the voluntary recall. On February 21, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Department of\nJustice (DOJ) seeking documents and information related to our Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including information relating to complaints surrounding the\nproducts and our decision to recall the Rad-G®. Additionally, on March 25, 2024, we received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking documents\nand information related to customer returns of our Rad-G® and Rad-97® products, including returns related our recall of select Rad-G® products in 2024. We are\ninvestigating the reasons for the delay between August 2023 and February 2024 when the recall was initiated. We are cooperating with the government and\nmay expend significant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoena and the investigative demand and any related\ninvestigation or any other future requests for information.\nPromotion of our healthcare products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\nObtaining 510(k) clearance permits us to promote our products for the uses cleared by the FDA. Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is\nknown as “off-label” use. Physicians may use our products off-label because the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician’s choice of treatment within the\npractice of medicine, but we may not promote our products “off-label”. While we may request additional cleared indications for our current products, the FDA\nmay deny those requests, require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any\ncleared product as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that our products were promoted for off-label use or that false, misleading or inadequately\nsubstantiated promotional claims have been made by us or our OEM partners, it could request that we or our OEM partners modify those promotional materials\nor it could take regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal\npenalties. While certain U.S. courts have held that truthful, non-misleading, off-label information is protected under the First Amendment under certain\ncircumstances, the FDA continues to take the position that off-label promotion is subject to enforcement action.\nIt is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our communications, including promotional or\ntraining materials, to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use. If not successfully defended, enforcement actions related to off-label promotion\ncould result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In any such event, our\nreputation could be damaged, adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to extensive fines and penalties.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products. If any of our claims are determined to be false, misleading or\ndeceptive, our products could be considered misbranded under the FDCA or in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. We could also face lawsuits\nfrom our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading.\nGovernment agencies in the EU, UK, Japan and other countries and jurisdictions have similar regulations on the advertising and promotion of medical devices.\nIf we fail to comply with any of these regulations, our reputation could be damaged, adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to\nextensive fines and penalties.\n*The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving. Many of the laws and\nregulations in this area are subject to uncertain interpretation, and our failure to comply could result in claims, penalties or increased costs or\notherwise harm our business.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Canada, China and many other jurisdictions where we\noffer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nA growing number of U.S. states have passed comprehensive privacy laws. These state laws govern the processing of residents’ personal information. Among\nmany new requirements, some of the state privacy laws expand consumers’ rights (such as opting out of the sale of personal information to third parties and\ntargeted advertising, restricting certain uses and disclosures of sensitive data, and requesting access, deletion, or correction of personal information). Some state\nlaws also minimize what data can be collected from consumers and how businesses may use and disclose it. These state privacy laws also require businesses to\nmake disclosures to consumers about data collection, use and sharing practices, and some state privacy laws require that businesses obtain consent from\nconsumers for certain uses and disclosures of their sensitive data. In addition, some of these state privacy laws, along with other standalone state health privacy\nlaws, subject certain health-related information to additional safeguards and disclosures and some specifically regulate consumer health data, such as the\nWashington My Health My Data Act and the Nevada health data privacy law that each went into effect this year. There is significant uncertainty regarding how\nregulators will interpret and enforce this patchwork of new laws, particularly to the extent there are inconsistencies or differences in their requirements. In\naddition, in states that allow for a private right of action to enforce these laws, we are subjected to a higher risk of individual and class action lawsuits.\nMoreover, we have observed an increase in plaintiffs seeking to apply older privacy laws such as the Video Privacy Protection Act and the California Invasion\nof Privacy Act to newer technologies to allege claims of invasion of privacy rights.\nWe continue to be subject to federal privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), in certain circumstances,\nin connection with any personal health information or medical information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the operation of our\nbusiness. Further, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which, in recent years, has increased its scrutiny of the practices of\nentities that collect certain health-related information from consumers. Moreover, comprehensive federal data privacy legislation has been proposed and, if\npassed, would further change the privacy and data security compliance landscape. In addition, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to\ndisclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience and to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk\nmanagement, strategy and governance.\nAll 50 U.S. states have data breach notification laws that, if violated, could result in penalties, fines and litigation. In addition, many states have implemented\nor are in the process of implementing related legislation, including state-specific biometric privacy laws that have resulted in individual and class-action\nlawsuits against businesses. The full impact of these laws on our business is yet to be determined, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as\nadditional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers.\nInternationally, the European Data Protection Board continues to release guidelines for industries and impose fines related to the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), some of which have been very significant. To improve coordination among EU supervisory authorities, the European Commission has\nproposed a new regulation that would help to streamline enforcement of the GDPR in cross-border cases. Meanwhile, there continues to be persistent\nuncertainty relating to the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S., or other non-adequate countries, following the Schrems II decision. On July 10,\n2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). The decision, which took effect on the day of\nits adoption, concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EEA to companies certified to the\nDPF. However, it remains too soon to tell how the future of Privacy Shield 2.0 will evolve and what impact it will have on our international activities. At least\none challenge to the DPF is pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n73\nTable of Contents\nFurther, Brexit has led and could also lead to legislative and regulatory changes that may increase our compliance costs. As of January 1, 2021 and the expiry\nof transitional arrangements agreed to between the UK and the EU, data processing in the UK is governed by a UK version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR\nand the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement\nactions for certain violations. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an Adequacy Decision for the UK, allowing for the relatively free\nexchange of personal information between the EU and the UK, (as the UK correspondingly allows transfers back to the EU). However, the European\nCommission may suspend the Adequacy Decision if it considers that the UK no longer provides for an adequate level of data protection. Following the UK\nnational elections in July 2024, the new UK Labour Government has expressed its intention to introduce into Parliament two pieces of legislation to regulate\nthe use of digital IDs and to strengthen the UK’s cyber defenses, but has yet to signal an intention to materially change the UK’s data protection framework.\nThe government also stated an intention to more heavily regulate the development of artificial intelligence but referenced no specific legislation.\nOther international jurisdictions, including Canada, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the UAE, Singapore, South Korea, Mexico, Australia, Argentina,\nIndia and Brazil, among others, have also implemented, or are in the process of implementing laws relating to data privacy and protection that are all already in\neffect or are anticipated to go into effect soon, or are amending existing laws. In addition, several jurisdictions such as South Korea have shown increased\nenforcement of their existing data privacy and security laws. Although we believe that we are complying with the GDPR and similar laws, these laws are still\nrelatively new. Therefore, as international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement\ninformation become available, we may incur additional costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements.\nWe may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws. Violations of these laws, or allegations of\nsuch violations, could subject us to criminal or civil, monetary or and non-monetary penalties, disrupt our operations, involve significant management\ndistraction, negatively impact our brand image, subject us to class action lawsuits and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties\nif we are unable to fully comply with these laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include, but are not limited to:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe,\nkickback or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare\nprogram (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n• the federal False Claims Act and other federal laws which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented,\nclaims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, other government payers or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n• the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and\ntransfers of value to certain healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals in the U.S.; and\n• state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by\ngovernmental programs and non-governmental third-party payers, including commercial insurers.\nIf we are found to have violated any such laws or other similar governmental regulations, including their foreign counterparts, that are directly or indirectly\napplicable to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties could adversely affect our\nability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against such action,\ncould cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe may experience conflicts of interest with Willow with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\nPrior to our initial public offering in August 2007, our stockholders owned 99% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Willow, and we believe that a\nnumber of our stockholders, including certain of our directors and executive officers, continue to own shares of Willow stock. Joe Kiani, our Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer (CEO), is also the Chairman and CEO of Willow.\n74\nTable of Contents\nDue to the interrelated nature of Willow with us, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Willow,\npotential acquisitions of businesses or products, the development and ownership of technologies and products, the sale of products, markets and other matters\nin which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of Willow. In addition, we and\nWillow may disagree regarding the interpretation of certain terms in the Cross-Licensing Agreement. We cannot guarantee that any conflict of interest will be\nresolved in our favor, or that, with respect to our transactions with Willow, we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with\nanother third-party.\nWe will be required to assign to Willow and pay Willow for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring\nof non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®.\nUnder the Cross-Licensing Agreement, if we develop certain products or technologies that relate to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters,\nincluding improvements to Masimo SET® for the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, we would be required to assign these developments to\nWillow and then license the technology back from Willow in consideration for upfront payments and royalty obligations to Willow. Therefore, these products\nand technologies would be deemed to have been developed or improved exclusively by Willow.\nIn addition, we will not be reimbursed by Willow for our expenses relating to the development or improvement of any such products or technologies, which\nexpenses may be significant. As a result of these terms, we may not generate any revenue from the further development of certain products and technologies for\nthe monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET®, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIn the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Willow grants a license to rainbow® technology to a third-party, our\nbusiness would be adversely affected.\nWillow owns all of the proprietary rights to certain rainbow® technology developed with our proprietary Masimo SET® for products intended to be used in the\n“Willow Market”, and all rights to any non-vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement. In\naddition, Willow has the right to terminate the Cross-Licensing Agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow® technology to third-parties if we breach certain\nterms of the agreement, including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or\nmarket products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology. If we lose our exclusive license to rainbow® technology, we would lose the ability to prevent\nothers from making, using, selling or importing products using rainbow® technology in our market. As a result, we would likely be subject to increased\ncompetition within our market, and Willow or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow® technology from Willow would be able to offer related products.\nWe may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology cost-effectively or successfully.\nAs a result of the royalties that we must pay to Willow, it is generally more expensive for us to make products that incorporate licensed rainbow® technology\nthan products that do not include licensed rainbow® technology.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to sell products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology at a price the market is willing to accept. If we cannot\ncommercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology successfully, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from these products to\nbe profitable, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRights provided to Willow in the Cross-Licensing Agreement may impede a change in control of our company.\nUnder the Cross-Licensing Agreement, a change in control includes the resignation or termination of Joe Kiani from his position as CEO of either Masimo or\nWillow. A change in control also includes other customary events, such as the sale or merger of Masimo or Willow to a non-affiliated third-party or the\nacquisition of 50% or more of the voting power of Masimo or Willow by a non-affiliated third-party.\nAmong other things, the Cross-Licensing Agreement provides that if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use “Masimo” as a company name and\ntrademark following a change in control, all rights to the “Masimo” trademark will automatically be assigned to Willow. This could delay or discourage\ntransactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for\ntheir shares over our then-current trading price. In addition, our requirement to assign all future improvements for non-vital signs to Willow could impede a\nchange in control of our company.\n75\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to\ncustomers.\nWe depend on certain sole or limited source suppliers for certain key materials and components, including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital\nconverter chips for certain products. These suppliers are located around the world, and the production and shipment of such materials and components may be\nconstrained globally due to freight carrier delays and other disruptions to the supply chain. We may experience manufacturing problems related to these\nsuppliers and other outside sources if such suppliers fail to develop, manufacture or ship products and components to us on a timely basis, or provide us with\nproducts and components that do not meet our quality standards and required quantities. We previously experienced supply constraints with regard to certain\ndigital signal processor chips and other components during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected our sales during 2022. In addition, from time to time there\nhave been industry-wide shortages of certain components that we use in certain products. We may also experience price increases for materials, components\nand shipping with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins.\nIf any of these problems occur, we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these products and components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us,\nwhich could harm our ability to manufacture our own products and components profitably or on time.\n*Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions or separations of businesses and strategic investments or joint ventures, could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses and their employees successfully into our existing\noperations or achieve the desired results of our initiatives.\nWe have acquired several businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. For example, on April 11, 2022, we completed\nour acquisition of Sound United. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, on April 11, 2022, we entered into a Credit Facility to partially fund the\nacquisition. Future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or reduce our earnings per\nshare or other financial metrics. Even if we complete acquisitions, there are many factors that could affect whether such acquisition, including our acquisition\nof Sound United, will be beneficial to our business, including, without limitation:\n• payment of above-market prices for acquisitions and higher than anticipated acquisition costs;\n• issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition price or a need to issue stock options or other equity-based compensation to newly-hired employees of\ntarget companies, resulting in dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders;\n• reduced profitability if an acquisition is not accretive to our business over either the short-term or the long-term;\n• difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products and other assets into our existing business;\n• delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, products or other assets;\n• regulatory challenges and becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements;\n• cybersecurity and compliance-related issues;\n• diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n• limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n• unanticipated issues dealing with unfamiliar suppliers, service providers or other collaborators of the acquired company;\n• higher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n• write-downs or impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquired company;\n• difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions;\n• negative impacts on our relationships with our employees, clients, customers or collaborators;\n• intellectual property and other litigation, other claims or liabilities in connection with the acquisition; and\n• changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue, gross profit margin or operating expense profile.\n76\nTable of Contents\nFurther, our ability to benefit from future acquisitions and/or external strategic investments, joint ventures or any other business separation depends on our\nability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate acceptable terms, evaluate prospective opportunities and bring acquired technologies and/or products to\nmarket at acceptable margins and operating expense levels. For example, on March 22, 2024, we announced that our Board has authorized management to\nevaluate a proposed separation of our consumer business. For more information regarding the risks associated with the potential separation of our consumer\nbusiness, see the risk factor below with the heading “The potential separation of our consumer business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may\nnot be completed on the terms currently contemplated, if at all, and, if completed, may not achieve the intended benefits.”\nWe may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, product liabilities or other\nundisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition or investment, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties, other liabilities or\nasset impairments. In addition, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other external investment as rapidly as expected, or at all,\ninvestors or analysts may downgrade our stock.\nWe also expect to continue to carry out internal strategic initiatives that we believe are necessary to grow our revenues and expand our business, both in the\nU.S. and abroad. For example, we have continued to invest in international expansion programs designed to increase our worldwide presence and take\nadvantage of market expansion opportunities around the world. Although we believe our investments in these initiatives continue to be in the long-term best\ninterests of Masimo and our stockholders, there are no assurances that such initiatives will yield favorable results for us. Accordingly, if these initiatives are not\nsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected\npenalties, liabilities or asset impairments in connection with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n*Our new products and changes to existing products, including as a result of our acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or\ngenerate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our non-healthcare expansion, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation or financial results.\nIn connection with the Sound United acquisition, we have expanded our business and product strategy to additionally focus on non-healthcare consumer\nproducts to integrate with our successful medical technology businesses. Further, we may introduce certain changes to our existing healthcare products or\nintroduce new and unproven products. Prior to the Sound United acquisition, we did not have significant experience with consumer hardware products, and\nSound United does not have experience with healthcare products, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and\ntechnologies and integrate them with our existing products and platforms. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term strategic initiative that\nwill involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in medical technology and consumer products, and collaboration with\nother companies, developers, partners and other participants. However, our non-healthcare business may not develop in accordance with our vision and\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products or services we build for our consumer business may be uncertain. We may be unsuccessful in our\nresearch and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the consumer products business. Our new\nstrategic efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. In addition, as our non-healthcare business continues to\nevolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and international jurisdictions, which we were not previously affected by, including\nin the areas of privacy, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management\ntime and attention, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the expansion of our non-healthcare business could be significantly impacted by our recently\nannounced evaluation of the separation of our consumer business (see the risk factor below with the heading “The potential separation of our consumer\nbusiness is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated, if at all, and, if completed, may not\nachieve the intended benefits” for more information regarding the risks associated with the potential separation of our consumer business). As a result of these\nor other factors, our non-healthcare expansion and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nOur Credit Facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Facility contains various affirmative covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including:\n• incurring specified types of additional indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional debt or equity financing at the\ntime needed or that such financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us (including guarantees or other contingent obligations);\n77\nTable of Contents\n• paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions in respect of our common stock or making other restricted payments, subject to specified\nexceptions;\n• making specified investments (including loans and advances);\n• selling or transferring certain assets;\n• creating certain liens;\n• consolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n• entering into certain transactions with any of our affiliates.\nIn addition, under our Credit Facility, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nOur ability to meet those financial ratios and affirmative and negative covenants could be affected by events beyond our control and, therefore, we cannot be\nassured that we will be able to continue to satisfy these requirements. A breach of any of these ratios or covenants could result in a default under our Credit\nFacility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility immediately due and\npayable, terminate all commitments to extend further credit and pursue legal remedies for recovery, all of which could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition. See Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for additional information on our Credit Facility.\nFurther, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Sound United acquisition, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nEven if we achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our\nindebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial, and business conditions as well as other factors\naffecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have incurred impairment charges for other intangible assets, and may incur further impairment charges in the future, which would negatively\nimpact our operating results.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we experienced continued declines in our stock price and certain worsening macro-economic market conditions, including\ncontinued slowing in demand for consumer audio products, which contributed to a significant decline in our market capitalization. Based on these factors, we\ndetermined that there was a triggering event for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which required an interim impairment assessment. Accordingly,\nwe performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and a recoverability test for other long lived assets with finite lives. This\nquantitative assessment indicated that the carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $7.0\nmillion. No impairment of goodwill was identified, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of September 30, 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, although we experienced a recovery in our stock price and stabilization in our market capitalization, we also experienced\ncontinued softening in customer demand for our non-healthcare core audio products and additional supply chain inefficiencies. Based on these factors and\nfurther quantitative assessment, we determined the carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately\n$3.0 million.\nWe review goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of the year or more\nfrequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In the event we are required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to our\ngoodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives in the future, such a non-cash charge could have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated statements of operations and balance sheets in the reporting period in which we record the charge.\n78\nTable of Contents\nWe may need additional capital and failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business\nand develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\nWe anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facility, and cash provided by operations, taken together, provide\nadequate resources to fund ongoing operating and capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12\nmonths. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments. If our existing resources are\ninsufficient to satisfy cash requirements, we may seek to obtain one or more additional credit facilities, sell equity or debt securities or pursue other forms of\nfinancing. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants\nthat could potentially restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, could result in dilution to\nstockholders. In addition, actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions,\ntransactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any\nevents of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could increase our costs of\nborrowing.\nOur ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including investors’ perception of, and demand for, our\nsecurities, conditions in the capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds, our future results of operations and financial condition, and general economic,\nmacro-economic, political and geopolitical conditions. In addition, even if debt financing is available, the cost of additional financing may be significantly\nhigher than those provided for in our current Credit Facility. Moreover, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or at\ntimes when we require it, each of which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business and operations and develop or enhance our products and\nofferings to respond to market demand or competitive or other business challenges.\n*The potential separation of our consumer business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms currently\ncontemplated, if at all, and, if completed, may not achieve the intended benefits.\nOn March 22, 2024, we announced that our Board has authorized management to evaluate a proposed separation of our consumer business. Our Board and\nmanagement are currently evaluating the proposed structure of the proposed separation, but we currently expect the proposed separation will include our\nconsumer audio (including hearables) and consumer health products, including the Stork baby monitor and the Freedom smart watch and band. As part of this\nongoing evaluation, on May 7, 2024, we entered into a non-binding term sheet with a potential joint venture partner regarding a potential consumer business\njoint venture, and on July 8, 2024, we announced that the potential joint venture party provided to us a non-binding term sheet confirmation outlining certain\nadditional terms and conditions of the potential joint venture. We remain in active discussions regarding the terms of the potential joint venture, which are\nsubject to, among other matters, further discussion and agreement between the parties, completion of due diligence and receipt of all corporate or other\napprovals required by us and the potential joint venture partner(s), including approval by our Board. The proposed separation is complex, and completion of the\nproposed separation and the timing of its completion will be subject to a number of factors and conditions, including the finalization of the structure of the\nproposed separation and approval by our Board, as well as the satisfaction of conditions to completing the proposed separation, among other things. The\nuncertainties associated with this process, foreseen and unforeseen costs incurred, and efforts involved, may negatively affect our operating results, business\nand our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and vendors. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the\nproposed separation, including, but not limited to, changes in general economic and financial market conditions and material adverse changes in business or\nindustry conditions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete the proposed separation or that the proposed separation will maximize\nshareholder value or be the best path for success. In addition, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the proposed separation within any specified\ntimeline, or at all. Additionally, we are unable to determine the expected financial performance of Masimo prior to and following completion of any potential\nseparation along with any negative effects of the announcement or pendency of any potential separation may have on the market price of our securities and/or\nour financial performance. Delays or failure to consummate the proposed separation could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. The execution of the proposed separation has required and may continue to require significant time and attention from our senior management and\nemployees, which could cause disruption in business processes and adversely affect our financial results and our results of operations, and our employees may\nbe distracted due to uncertainty regarding the future state of our company. Additionally, foreseen and unforeseen costs may be incurred with the proposed\nseparation, including fees such as advisory, accounting, tax, legal, reorganization, restructuring, and various other fees, some of which may be incurred\nregardless if the proposed separation occurs. Furthermore, if the proposed separation is completed, we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and\nfinancial benefits that are expected to result from the proposed separation.\n79\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nConcentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from\ninfluencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of June 29, 2024, our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 18.5% of our\noutstanding stock. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Delaware law, these stockholders may be able to exercise significant\ninfluence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some\ncontrol over our management and policies in their roles as stockholders. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours. For\nexample, these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests.\nThe concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us, or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control\nof us, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock.\nIn addition, these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office or support or reject other\nmanagement and Board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant\nfinancing transactions.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately plan our expenses in the future or we may fail to meet\nour publicly announced guidance about our business and future operating results.\nFrom time to time, we release earnings guidance or other financial guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our\nfuture performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. Our guidance includes forward-looking statements based on\nprojections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are based on information known when they\nare issued, and, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and\ncontingencies relating to our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business\ndecisions, some of which will change. Some of those key assumptions include broader macro-economic conditions and the resulting impact of these factors on\nfuture consumer spending patterns and our business. These assumptions are inherently difficult to predict, particularly in the long term. Additionally, forecasted\nfinancial and operating results may differ materially from actual results, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and stock price. For\nexample, if certain of our assumptions or estimates prove to be wrong, including any of the economic trends and developments affecting our business discussed\nin Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report, either of\nwhich could negatively impact our stock price and expose us to potential shareholder litigation.\nWe generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended\nto imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of\nour business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or estimates or\nthat consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions,\ngeopolitical events, rising inflation, and rising interest rates, potential recessionary factors, and foreign exchange rate volatility, which could adversely affect\nour business and future operating results. We use the reports and models of economic experts in making assumptions relating to consumer discretionary\nspending and predictions as to timing and pace of any future economic impacts. If these models are incorrect or incomplete, or if we fail to accurately predict\nthe full impact of certain factors, such as macro-economic factors, the guidance and other forward-looking statements we provide may also be incorrect or\nincomplete. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating\nresults fails to meet expectations of analysts, investors, or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline. Guidance is necessarily\nspeculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary\nsignificantly from actual results. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our\ncommon stock.\n80\nTable of Contents\nOur corporate documents, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent\nattempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may\nconsider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to 5.0 million shares of “blank check” preferred stock. As a\nresult, without further stockholder approval, our Board has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock,\nincluding pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, such as those underlying the Rights Agreement we previously adopted on September 9, 2022, which we\nterminated in accordance with the terms of the Amendment to the Rights Agreement we entered into effective as of March 22, 2023. However, we may\nimplement a new stockholder rights plan in the future, which may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control by, among other things,\nmaking it uneconomical for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. With such rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult\nfor a third-party to acquire us.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation previously provided for a staggered Board, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with one-third of the\ndirectors coming up for reelection each year. However, at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders held on June 26, 2023, our stockholders approved an\namendment to our certificate of incorporation, pursuant to which we will phase-in the declassification of our Board over four years, whereby all members of\nour Board that are elected after our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders would be elected for annual terms. Accordingly, the three-year term for the Class I\ndirectors elected at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders will expire at our 2026 annual meeting of stockholders, the three-year term for the Class II\ndirectors elected at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders will expire as originally scheduled at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders and the three-year\nterm for the Class III directors elected at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders will expire as originally scheduled at our 2025 annual meeting of\nstockholders. The implementation of the declassification of our Board commenced at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. Directors elected at our 2024\nannual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter will be elected to serve a one-year term. Beginning with our 2026 annual\nmeeting of stockholders, all directors would stand for annual elections.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL). Under these provisions, if anyone\nbecomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could\ndiscourage a third-party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. For purposes of these provisions, an “interested\nstockholder” generally means someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding\nvoting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in the DGCL.\n*Shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, disrupt our business, result in a proxy contest or litigation and impact our stock\nprice.\nWe are subject to ongoing shareholder activism and may be subject to additional such activism in the future. Shareholder activism has resulted in substantial\ncosts and diversion of management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our business. Such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived\nuncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract\nand retain key personnel, and result in a change in control pursuant to the employment agreement between us and Joe Kiani, our Chairman and CEO.\n81\nTable of Contents\nWe value input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. Activist shareholders who disagree\nwith the composition of our Board, our strategy or the way our Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies and channels, such\nas through commencing another proxy contest, making public statements critical of our performance or business or engaging in other similar activities.\nResponding to shareholder activism can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees from\nour strategic initiatives, and we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party\nadvisors. For example, in 2022, Politan Capital Management LP and Politan Capital NY LLC and certain of their affiliates (Politan), acquired a material\nportion of our outstanding shares and filed a proxy statement with the SEC seeking an election of two of its nominees to our Board at our 2023 Annual\nMeeting. At the 2023 Annual Meeting held on June 26, 2023, our stockholders voted to elect both nominees designated by Politan to serve on our Board. As a\nresult of the contested director election, we continued to incur significant costs, as well as Board and management distraction during the first half of 2024,\nwhich we expect will continue through the remainder of 2024. In March 2024, Politan nominated two additional persons for election to our Board at our\nupcoming 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (2024 Annual Meeting). As a result of the contested director election, we are incurring significant costs, as\nwell as enduring Board and management distractions, all of which we expect to continue. On July 15, 2024, we commenced litigation against Politan and\ncertain of its affiliates, including Mr. Koffey and Ms. Brennan, members of our Board, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California\nseeking, among other things, an order declaring that Politan’s proxy materials for our upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting violate Section 14(a) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, an order enjoining Politan from voting any proxies received by means of Politan’s misleading proxy material, an order\ninvalidating any proxies Politan or other persons acting in concert with it obtained pursuant to the misleading proxy materials and an injunction requiring\nPolitan to correct material misstatements and omissions in Politan’s proxy materials for the 2024 Annual Meeting. The complaint also alleges, among other\nthings, that Mr. Koffey has assisted plaintiff’s counsel in separate litigation against our interests and in breach of his fiduciary duties to our stockholders and\nthat Mr. Koffey and Ms. Brennan breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by providing false or misleading information and omitting material facts to\nour stockholders through Politan’s proxy materials. Further, on July 17, 2024, Politan commenced litigation against the Company, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and\nMr. Chapek, members of our Board, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging that Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek breached their\nfiduciary duties to the Company by moving the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting from July 25, 2024 to September 19, 2024, and seeking, among other things,\nto have us set the record date and hold the 2024 Annual Meeting as soon as possible, without further adjournment or postponement. We believe we have good\nand substantial defenses to the claims in the Politan complaint, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these efforts.\nResponding to the ongoing proxy contest with Politan or proxy contests from any other activist shareholders could have a material adverse effect on us for at\nleast the following reasons:\n• shareholders may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and governance or to acquire control over our Board or our Company;\n• while we welcome the opinions of all shareholders, responding to proxy contests is likely to be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and\npotentially divert the attention of our Board, management team and other employees away from their regular duties and the pursuit of business\nopportunities to enhance shareholder value;\n• perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of potential changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in\nthe strategic direction of the business, the loss of key employees, including our executive officers, instability or lack of continuity, particularly if the\nactivism campaign results in the appointment of one or more activist shareholders on the Board, which may cause concern to our existing or potential\ncollaboration partners, employees and shareholders; may be exploited by our competitors; may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or limit\nour ability to timely initiate or advance clinical trials; and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n• if additional individuals are elected to our Board who may have a specific agenda, including a plan to terminate our Chief Executive Officer or other\nexecutive officers, initiate a hostile takeover, or sell our healthcare or non-healthcare business, it may result in operational disruptions and adversely affect\nour ability to effectively implement our strategic plans in a timely manner and create additional value for our shareholders;\n• activist directors may make overly burdensome demands of Company management and materially and unnecessarily increase management’s workload;\nand\n• proxy contests and related litigation by shareholders could cause significant fluctuations in our share price based on temporary or speculative market\nperceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n82\nTable of Contents\nExclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or\nstockholders to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or as\nto which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine. However, this choice of forum provision does not apply to (a) actions in which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware concludes that an\nindispensable party is not subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts, or (b) actions in which a federal court has assumed exclusive jurisdiction to a\nproceeding. This choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not\napply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees or stockholders.\nFurthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal\nproceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum\nprovision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our periodic financial results and may not maintain our current levels of profitability in the future.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Many of the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. and\nseveral of the members of the EU, have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors. In\naddition, continuing uncertainty in the U.S. economy may result in continued inflationary pressures globally and in the U.S. in particular, which may contribute\nto future interest rate volatility.\nOur business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these uncertain economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic\nconditions, which may potentially impair our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all; changes in consumer spending during a\nrecession; and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nWe are also unable to predict how changing global economic conditions or potential global health concerns will affect our critical customers, suppliers and\ndistributors. Any negative impact of such matters on our critical customers, suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of\noperations or financial condition. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels and are relatively fixed in the short-\nterm.\nAs a result, if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that\nperiod. Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period.\nIn addition, the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties\nand assumptions. Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments, the impact of which could significantly affect our\nresults of operations. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent accounting changes related to our embedded leases within certain deferred equipment agreements have also resulted in the acceleration of the timing\nrelated to our recognition of revenue and expenses associated with certain equipment provided to healthcare customers at no up-front charge. Since we cannot\ncontrol the timing of when our customers will request us to deliver such equipment, our revenue and costs with respect to leased equipment could vary\nsubstantially in any given quarter or year, which could further increase quarterly or annual fluctuations within our financial results.\n83\nTable of Contents\nDue to these and other factors, you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. If our operating results fail to\nmeet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\n*If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel, we may not be able to manage our\noperations or meet our growth objectives.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management, especially Joe Kiani, our CEO, and other key officers. We are also heavily dependent on our engineers and\nfield sales team, including sales representatives and clinical specialists. We do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies with respect to any of our\nkey personnel.\nWe believe certain of our competitors with greater financial resources than us have targeted our key personnel for recruitment and will likely continue to do so\nin the future. To the extent that key personnel depart, we may be required to bring on new hires that require training and take time before they achieve full\nproductivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals.\nIn general, our key personnel may terminate their employment at any time and for any reason without notice, unless the individual is a participant in our 2007\nSeverance Protection Plan, in which case the individual has agreed to provide us with six months’ notice if such individual decides to voluntarily resign. In\naddition, Politan Capital Management LP and Politan Capital NY LLC, which are managed by Quentin Koffey, a member of our Board, previously filed a\nlawsuit against us and members of our Board seeking to invalidate the employment agreement of Mr. Kiani. Although Politan subsequently filed a motion to\ndismiss the complaint without prejudice, which was approved by the court in September 2023, Politan can refile this or any other complaint against us, our\nBoard or any individual director at any time. Moreover, in connection with the proxy contest being conducted by Politan with respect to our 2024 Annual\nMeeting, our Chief Operating Officer has submitted to our Board a conditional resignation to become effective in the event that Mr. Kiani is removed as our\nChairman of the Board and CEO. Numerous other key employees from our leadership and engineering teams have publicly expressed that they may not\ncontinue with us if Mr. Kiani is replaced. The loss of the services of members of our key personnel or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in\nthe future could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the development and introduction of our products.\nIn addition, regulation or legislation impacting the workforce, such as the rule published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) purporting to generally\nprevent employers from entering into non-competition agreements with employees and require employers to rescind existing non-competition agreements, may\nlead to increased uncertainty in hiring and competition for talent. On July 3, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted a motion to\nstay and preliminarily enjoin the effective date of the FTC’s final rule banning non-competition restrictions. By this order, the September 4, 2024, effective date\nof the FTC’s non-compete ban is stayed, and the FTC is enjoined from implementing or enforcing the ban. However, as of now, the order applies only to the\nnamed plaintiffs in the Texas pending litigation, and it is uncertain whether the stay may apply to the Company.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by\nfinancial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition\nand results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties\nor other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other\nsimilar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was\nclosed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.\nSimilarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a statement by the Department of the\nTreasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure,\nincluding funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB,\nSignature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. Although\nwe are not a borrower or party to any such instruments with SVB, Signature or any other financial institution currently in receivership, if any of our lenders or\ncounterparties to any such instruments were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, counterparties to SVB credit\nagreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB\nand uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-\n2010 financial crisis.\n84\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts\nadequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial\ninstitutions with which we have credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could\ninclude, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity\nagreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the\nprospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which\nwe have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally.\nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected\nbusiness operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n• delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets;\n• loss of access to revolving existing credit facilities or other working capital sources and/or the inability to refund, roll over or extend the maturity of, or\nenter into new credit facilities or other working capital resources;\n• potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require us to maintain letters or credit or other credit support arrangements;\n• potential or actual breach of financial covenants in our credit agreements or credit arrangements;\n• potential or actual cross-defaults in other credit agreements, credit arrangements or operating or financing agreements; or\n• termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements.\nAny decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating\nexpenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal\nor state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not\ndescribed above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results\nof operations.\nIn addition, any further deterioration in the macro-economic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our customers or\nsuppliers, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, a customer may fail to make payments when due, default under their agreements with us, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, or a\nsupplier may determine that it will no longer deal with us as a customer. In addition, a customer or supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity\nor other risks that are described above as factors that could result in material adverse impacts on our company, including but not limited to delayed access or\nloss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. Any customer or\nsupplier bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any customer to make payments when due, or any breach or default by a customer or supplier, or the loss of\nany significant supplier relationships, could result in material losses to our company and may have material adverse impacts on our business.\nA regional or global recession and other negative macro-economic trends could adversely affect our consumer business.\nOur consumer products are generally considered non-essential, discretionary products. As such, many of these products can be especially sensitive to general\ndownturns in the economy. Negative macro-economic conditions, such as high inflation, recession, changes to monetary policy, increasing interest rates and\ndecreasing consumer confidence can adversely impact demand for these products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nFuture changes in accounting pronouncements and tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, could have a significant impact on our reported results, and\nmay affect our historical reporting of previous transactions.\nNew accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, and evolving interpretations thereof, have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Future changes\nmade by new accounting standards may apply prospectively or retrospectively, depending on the method of adoption, and may recast previously reported\nresults. For additional information related to the impact of new accounting pronouncements, please see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”,\nto our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n85\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, future changes to the U.S. tax code and its regulations could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and the implementation of these\nchanges could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar Two) that has\nbeen agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on how Pillar Two\nrules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. A number of countries have utilized the administrative guidance as a starting\npoint for legislation that is effective January 1, 2024. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending\nlegislative adoption by individual countries.\nOur retirement and post-retirement pension benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe sponsor several defined benefit plans with post-retirement benefits to certain employees in certain international markets. These defined benefit plans are\nfunded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates,\ninvestment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and post-retirement benefit\nobligations, causing volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future\nfunding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled,\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, regulatory proceedings or other disputes. In general, claims made by or against us in disputes and\nother legal or regulatory proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against, requiring us to expend significant resources and divert\nthe efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations. These potential claims may include, but are not limited to\npersonal injury and class action lawsuits, intellectual property claims and regulatory investigations relating to the advertising and promotional claims about our\nproducts and employee claims against us based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. In addition, we may become\nsubject to claims against companies we acquire based on circumstances arising prior to the acquisition, and the sellers of the acquired company may have no\nobligation to reimburse us for any resulting damages or expenses.\nDue to the complexity of our business and the variety of risks that we face, our internal risk mitigation policies and procedures may not always be sufficient to\nallow us to identify issues and take corrective action before a claim, lawsuit or regulatory action is initiated against us. Failure to detect and remediate issues at\nan early stage could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in increased liability in any ensuing proceeding.\nAny litigation, proceedings or dispute, even those without merit, may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit\nthe future performance of our operations. Any adverse determination against us in these proceedings, or even the allegations contained in the claims, regardless\nof whether they are ultimately found to be without merit, may also result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n86\nTable of Contents\nChanges to government immigration regulations may materially affect our workforce and limit our supply of qualified professionals, or increase our\ncost of securing workers.\nWe recruit professionals on a global basis and must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Some of our\nemployees are working under Masimo-sponsored temporary work visas, including H1-B visas. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B temporary work\npermit petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the current U.S. immigration visa program may be significantly\noverhauled, and the number of H1-B visas available, as well as the process to obtain them, may be subject to significant change. Any resulting changes to this\nvisa program could impact our ability to recruit, hire and retain qualified skilled personnel. If we are unable to obtain work visas in sufficient quantities or at a\nsufficient rate for a significant period of time, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe risks inherent in operating internationally, including the purchase, sale and shipment of our components and products across international\nborders, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently derive approximately 44% of our net sales from international operations. In addition, we purchase a portion of our raw materials and components\nfrom international sources. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of materials and components from\ninternational sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, including those related to duties, tariffs and conflict minerals.\nCompliance with such regulations is costly and we could be exposed to potentially significant penalties, fines and interest if we are found not to be in\ncompliance with such regulations. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but\nare not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges,\nseizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. We have historically engaged in\ntransactions with entities related to or located in countries subject to certain U.S. export restrictions. For example, we have had sales of medical products\ndestined for Iran. Although these activities have not been financially material to our business, financial condition or results of operations, and were undertaken\nin accordance with general licenses authorizing such activities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, we may not be\nsuccessful in ensuring compliance with limitations or restrictions on business in Iran or any other countries subject to economic sanctions and embargoes\nimposed by the U.S. Additionally, the export of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the U.S. to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export\nauthorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control. Also, the failure to comply with\napplicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping, manufacturing and sales activities.\nIn addition, changes in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade\nagreements, could negatively impact our business. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries,\nwhich has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Changes or uncertainty in tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or\nother countries in response could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able\nto sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more\ndetailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These\nrisks include, but are not limited to:\n• the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n• the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n• a shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n• the loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge, or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets;\n• changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n• the imposition of new trade restrictions;\n• the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n• compliance with foreign tax laws, regulations and requirements;\n• pricing pressure;\n• changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n87\nTable of Contents\n• laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n• political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the global impact of\nrestrictions and sanctions imposed on Russia and the Israel-Palestine-Iran war;\n• financial and civil unrest worldwide;\n• outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or other local or global health issues;\n• the inability to collect amounts paid by foreign government customers to our appointed foreign agents;\n• longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and different collection remedies with respect to receivables; and\n• difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights.\nA trade war, trade barriers or other governmental actions related to tariffs, international trade agreements, import or export restrictions or other trade policies\ncould adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, therefore, adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries\nfrom promising or making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining an advantage to secure or retain business. Because of the\npredominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental\nentities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. We have adopted policies and practices that help us ensure compliance with these anti-bribery laws.\nHowever, such policies and practice may require us to invest in additional monitoring resources or forgo certain business opportunities in order to ensure global\ncompliance with these laws. Additionally, any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on\nour ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nAny material decrease in our international sales would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property protection laws in foreign countries differ substantially from those in the U.S. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection in\nforeign countries, or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more\neffectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors. As a result, events that result in global\neconomic uncertainty could significantly affect our results of operations in the form of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and potential\ndevaluation of the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nWhile a majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, some of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than\nthe U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on the approximation of the exchange rates applied\nduring a respective period. Similarly, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact business in their respective country’s local currency, which is also their\nfunctional currency. In addition, certain production costs related to our manufacturing operations are denominated in local currency. As a result, expenses of\nthese foreign subsidiaries and certain production costs, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a\nrespective period.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as cash deposits. When\nconverted to U.S. Dollars, these receivables, payables and cash deposits can vary depending on the monthly exchange rates at the end of the period. In addition,\ncertain intercompany transactions may give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses based on the currency underlying such\nintercompany transactions. Accordingly, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at the\nbalance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average monthly exchange\nrates applicable during the period. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose\nfunctional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our foreign currency exchange rate risk, please see “Quantitative\nand Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe currently manufacture our products at a limited number of locations and any disruption to, expansion of, or changes in trade programs related to\nsuch manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia that may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. Earthquakes are of particular\nsignificance since some of our facilities are located in earthquake-prone areas. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power\nloss, attacks from extremist or terrorist organizations, epidemics, communication failures, fire, floods, hurricanes and similar events. Our facilities and the\nmanufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial time to repair if significant damage were to\nresult from any of these occurrences.\nIf one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a natural or man-made disaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers if we could not\nshift production to our other manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties\nmay not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If the lease for any of our\nleased facilities is terminated, we are unable to renew any of our leases or we are otherwise forced to seek alternative facilities, or if we voluntarily expand one\nor more of our manufacturing operations to new locations, we may incur additional transition costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products\nuntil the new facilities are available and operating. Additionally, we have occasionally experienced seasonality and other shortages among our manufacturing\nworkforce, and if we continue to experience such seasonality or other workforce shortages or otherwise have issues retaining employees or contractors at our\nmanufacturing facilities, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands.\nOur global manufacturing and distribution are dependent upon our manufacturing facilities in multiple countries, and the expedient importation of raw\nmaterials and exportation of finished goods between these facilities. Undue delays and/or closures of cross-border transit facilities, or any restrictions by local\ngovernments related to the movement of goods to or from the U.S., may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders and supply our customers, as well as\nadversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, delays and closures of shipping ports, or ports of entry into and out of the U.S., including as a result of labor strikes or shortages, may delay our\nability to fulfill order and supply of our non-healthcare consumer products, which could also adversely impact our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nOur manufacturing facilities in Mexico are authorized to operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (IMMEX) program. The IMMEX program allows us to\nimport certain items from the U.S. into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated timeframe.\nMaquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the IMMEX\nprogram and other local regulations. Failure to comply with the IMMEX program regulations, including any changes thereto, could increase our manufacturing\ncosts and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n*If we do not accurately forecast customer demand, we may hold suboptimal inventory levels that could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to meet the demand of our customers, our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could reduce our\nrevenue and gross profit margin. Conversely, if product demand decreases, we may be unable to timely adjust our manufacturing cost structure, resulting in\nexcess capacity, which would lower gross product margins. Similarly, if we are unable to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to record charges\nrelated to excess or obsolete inventory, which would also lower our gross margin. Each of our business segments is individually influenced by many factors,\nincluding but not limited to: new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, holiday schedules, hospital census, the timing of the influenza season,\nholiday seasons, consumer pressures, inflationary and recessionary pressures, consumer demand and preferences, and competitors’ marketing promotions and\nsales incentives; among many other factors.\n89\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we may experience seasonal demand for our products and demand for such products could decrease significantly during a recession. For example,\nhealthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have generally historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality\nof the U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer elective procedures utilizing our healthcare products.\nThe flu season concluded abnormally early and faded quickly in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in reduced inpatient census. In addition, some customers\nheld elevated sensor inventory levels due to discounting in prior quarters, which was discontinued during the second quarter. Healthcare facilities and hospitals\nexperienced fewer flu-related hospitalizations and medical office visits, which decreased consumption of our single-patient use sensors and consumables. The\ncorresponding delays in reordering for our single-patient use sensors and consumables had an adverse impact on our healthcare revenue for the second half of\n2023. Similarly, our non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year generally produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other\nquarters of our fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. Our promotional discounting activity may\nnegatively impact our gross margin. Any shortfalls in expected revenue due to a mismatch in supply of and demand for our products, could cause our operating\nresults to suffer significantly, and seasonal or similar variances may also result in fluctuations in our revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and investors’ confidence in us could be adversely affected.\nWe are required to prepare and disclose certain information under the Exchange Act, in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety, and\nour failure to do so could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expose us to lawsuits and\nrestrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, any material weakness in our internal control environment could result\nin the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, negatively impact the trading price of our\nstock, and adversely affect investors’ confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.\nChanging laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and\noperating results.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure have created, and will create, additional compliance\nrequirements for us. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities\nmore difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other\nbusiness concerns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nTo maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we have invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary\nresources to comply with evolving standards.\nOur stockholders in certain instances have not approved our advisory vote on named executive officer compensation. If we are involved in a lawsuit related to\ncompensation matters or any other matters not covered by our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, we may incur significant expenses in defending\nagainst such lawsuits, or be subject to significant fines or required to take significant remedial actions, each of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n90\nTable of Contents\nIf product liability claims are brought against us, we could face substantial liability and costs.\nOur products expose us to product liability claims and product recalls, including, but not limited to, those that may arise from unauthorized off-label use,\nmalfunctions, design flaws or manufacturing defects related to our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems. In addition,\nas we continue to expand our product portfolio, we may enter or create new markets, including consumer markets, which may expose us to additional product\nliability risks. For example, with our previous acquisition of TNI®, we added softFlow® technology to our product portfolio. While this technology provides\nefficient, quiet and comfortable respiratory support to patients, it may present increased risk of infection to caregivers. In addition, with the Sound United\nAcquisition, we added multiple broadly distributed premium audio brands to our product portfolio and significantly expanded our consumer base worldwide,\nwhich could expose us to increased product liability claims.\nWe cannot be certain that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any or all damages for product liability claims that may be brought against\nus in the future. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against\nany product liability claims.\nAdditionally, the laws and regulations regarding product liability are constantly evolving, both through the passage of new legislation at the state and federal\nlevels and through new interpretations of existing legislation. As the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding product liability change, we may become\nexposed to greater liability than currently anticipated.\nAny losses that we may suffer from product liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability\nof our technology and products, together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees, may subject us to significant damages and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations.\nCertain manufacturing processes for our products may involve the storage, use, generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, including\nsilicone adhesives, solder and solder paste, sealants, epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. As a result, we\nare subject to certain environmental laws, as well as certain other laws and regulations, that restrict the materials that can be used in our products or in our\nmanufacturing processes. For example, products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in the EU markets under the Restriction of the Use of\nHazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). RoHS prohibits companies from selling products that contain certain hazardous materials in EU member states. In\naddition, the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products.\nCompliance with such regulations may be costly and, therefore, we may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nIn addition, new environmental laws may further affect how we manufacture our products, how we use, generate or dispose of hazardous materials and waste,\nor further affect what materials can be used in our products. Any required changes to our operations or products may increase our manufacturing costs,\ndetrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.\nIn connection with our research and manufacturing activities, we use, and our employees may be exposed to, materials that are hazardous to human health,\nsafety or the environment. The risk of accidental injury to our employees or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated, and we could be held\nliable for any resulting damages, the related liability for which could exceed our reserves. We do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities. If an\nenforcement action were to occur, our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed, even if we were to prevail or settle the action on\nterms favorable to us.\n*We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any\ncybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our\nsystems and networks, including the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data, and those of our customers, partners,\nsuppliers and third-party service providers. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our internal business information, and to ship products to customers\nand invoice them on a timely basis, depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems.\n91\nTable of Contents\nPortions of our information technology systems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing\nsystems implementation work. In addition, interfaces between our products and our customers’ computer networks could provide additional opportunities for\ncybersecurity attacks on us and our customers. The techniques used to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from\nless regulated and remote areas of the world. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, and while none that we have experienced to date have\nbeen material in nature, we expect that we will continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks in the future. Cybersecurity threats and attacks in particular are\nevolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security\nbreaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although the\ncyber incidents experienced to date have not had a material impact, there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent or detect security\nbreaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the\nunderlying information technology system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these\nsystems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product\nfulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our\nsystems and information contained within those systems could also subject us to significant litigation and regulatory enforcement risks in all of the jurisdictions\nin which we operate.\nThe impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Palestine-Iran war, on the global economy, energy supplies and raw materials is\nuncertain, but may prove to negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe short and long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the war in Israel are difficult to predict at this time. We continue to monitor any\nadverse impact that the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent institution of sanctions against Russia by the U.S. and several European and Asian\ncountries; along with the war in Israel, may have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our\nsuppliers and customers. For example, a prolonged conflict may result in challenges associated with timely receipt of customer payments and banking\ntransactions in Russia, increased inflation, escalating energy prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of raw materials. In addition, as a\nresult of the current conflict, we have stopped selling non-healthcare products in Russia indefinitely. Furthermore, the Israel-Palestine-Iran war could result in\ndisruption in the Middle East more broadly and negatively impact our operations in that region. We will continue to monitor these fluid situations and develop\ncontingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop. To the extent the wars in Ukraine or Israel may adversely\naffect our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. Such risks include, but are not\nlimited to, adverse effects on macro-economic conditions, including inflation; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through\ncyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our product\nprices; disruptions in global supply chains; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\n*Our stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been and could continue to be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities. For example, our closing stock price\nranged from $109.17 to $146.85 per share from December 31, 2023 to June 29, 2024. Factors contributing to our stock price volatility may include our\nfinancial performance, as well as broader economic, political and market factors. In addition to the other risk factors previously discussed in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, there are many other factors that we may not be able to control that could have a significant effect on our stock price. These include, but\nare not limited to:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements of new products;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, including those relating to our earnings or financial guidance, our other public announcements and our filings\nwith the SEC;\n• strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n• changes in our growth rates or our competitors’ growth rates;\n92\nTable of Contents\n• developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n• ongoing legal proceedings;\n• our inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n• concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products;\n• changes in financial markets or general economic conditions, including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad;\n• effects of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• sales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board or certain institutional stockholders;\n• our evaluation of a proposed separation of our consumer business;\n• shareholder activism, including our pending contested solicitation against Politan;\n• changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally; and\n• short selling or other hedging activity in our stock.\nTherefore, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\n*Our investors could experience substantial dilution of their investments as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options, vesting of\noutstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs), or the grant of future equity awards by us.\nAs of June 29, 2024, approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, of which\napproximately 2.6 million shares were subject to options outstanding at such date at a weighted-average exercise price of $93.89 per share, approximately 3.6\nmillion shares were subject to outstanding RSUs, approximately 0.4 million shares were subject to outstanding PSUs and approximately 3.1 million shares\nwere available for future awards under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. Over the past 48 months, we have experienced higher rates of stock option exercises\ncompared to many earlier periods, and this trend may continue. To the extent outstanding options are exercised or outstanding RSUs or PSUs vest, our existing\nstockholders may incur dilution.\nWe rely on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other\nservice providers may further dilute our stockholders.\nFuture resales of our stock, including those by our insiders and a few investment funds, may cause our stock price to decline.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by our directors, our executive officers and a few investment funds. Resales by these stockholders of a\nsubstantial number of such shares, announcements of any proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be\nmade, could significantly reduce the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans\npursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future. Generally, these sales require public filings. Actual or potential\nsales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the insider has\nlost confidence in our stock and reduce the market price of our stock.\nWe have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our incentive equity plans pursuant to Registration Statements on Form S-8. All\nshares issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions on our affiliates\nunder Rule 144. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our stock.\n93\nTable of Contents\nWe may elect not to declare cash dividends on our stock, may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis, or may elect not to make\nany additional stock repurchases. As a result, any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock. In addition, the payment of any\nfuture dividends or the repurchase of our stock might limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities.\nOur Board may from time to time declare, and we may pay, dividends on our outstanding shares in the manner and upon the terms and conditions permitted\nunder applicable law. However, we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than paying cash dividends on\nour stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, our Credit Facility may limit our ability to pay cash dividends, repurchase our common stock or make other\ndistributions to stockholders. Any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations,\nearnings, capital requirements, financial condition, business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, our\nCredit Facility places limitations on our ability to pay dividends. In the event our Board declares any dividends, there is no assurance with respect to the\namount, timing or frequency of any such dividends.\nAny repurchase of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan authorized by our Board in June 2022 (Repurchase Program) will be at the discretion of\na committee comprised of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, results of operations, capital\nrequirements, financial conditions, available capital from operations or other sources, including debt, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, on\nAugust 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of\nnet stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Therefore, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, price or timing of any such repurchases. We\nmay elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than repurchasing additional outstanding shares. For additional\ninformation related to our Repurchase Program, please see Note 19, “Equity”, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn the event we pay dividends, or make any stock repurchases in the future, our ability to finance any material expansion of our business, including through\nacquisitions, investments or increased capital spending, or to fund our operations, may be limited. In addition, any repurchases we may make in the future may\nnot prove to be at optimal prices. Our Board may modify or amend the Repurchase Program, or adopt a new stock repurchase program, at any time at its\ndiscretion without stockholder approval.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) regulations, global climate change, corporate citizenship and related matters may adversely\naffect our business.\nThere is an increasing focus on ESG risks. Our customers, including distributors and retail partners have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that\ninclude ESG provisions that their suppliers or manufacturers must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. An\nincreasing number of participants in our industries are also joining voluntary ESG groups or organizations. These ESG provisions and initiatives are subject to\nchange, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced\nmanufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or\nprovisions, a customer may cease purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of\noperations.\nFurther, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in new or enhanced legal requirements. There continues to be a\nlack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such uncertainty may have an impact on our business, from the\ndemand for our products to our costs of compliance in the manufacturing and servicing of our products, all of which may impact our results of operations. In\naddition, climate change initiatives and legislation could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain,\nand could also increase insurance and other operating costs. In addition, on March 6, 2024, the SEC finalized new rules for public companies that will require\nextensive climate-related disclosures and significant analysis of the impact of climate-related issues on our business strategy, results of operations, and financial\ncondition (the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules), and extensive attestation requirements. The new rules require disclosure of, among other things, our material\nclimate-related risks and opportunities, greenhouse gas emissions inventory, climate-related targets and goals, and financial impacts of physical and transition\nrisks. Subsequently, in April 2024, the SEC issued an order staying implementation of the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules pending the resolution of certain\nchallenges. Nonetheless, our legal, accounting, and other compliance expenses may increase significantly, and compliance efforts may divert management time\nand attention as we prepare for the potential implementation of the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules, and such expenses, efforts and diversions of management\ntime and attention may be even greater if the SEC Climate Disclosure Rules ultimately go into effect. We may also be exposed to legal or regulatory action or\nclaims as a result of these new regulations. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public\nfilings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege our existing climate disclosures are misleading or deficient. All of these risks could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and/or stock price.\n94\nTable of Contents\nInvestors, stockholders, consumers, customers, suppliers and other third-parties are increasingly focusing on ESG and corporate social responsibility endeavors\nand reporting and transparency. Certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, customers, suppliers and other third-parties are also\nincreasingly focused on ESG practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived\nto have not responded appropriately, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition and/or stock price may be materially and\nadversely affected. Further, this increased focus on ESG issues may result in new regulations and/or third-party requirements that could adversely impact our\nbusiness, or certain shareholders reducing or eliminating their holdings of our stock, causing our stock price to decline.\n*Loss of or inability to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our consumer audio products could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we have established, and expect to continue to establish, relationships with public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound\nstudios, social media influencers and other endorsers, to develop, evaluate and promote our consumer audio products, as well as establish product authenticity\nwith consumers. However, as competition in our consumer segment has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such relationships have\nincreased, and competition to attract and retain high-quality endorsers has also increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with public\nfigures, music artists, automotive designers, sound studios, social media influencers or other endorsers, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high\nvisibility associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands,\nconsumer product revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound\nstudios, social media influencers or other endorsers, were to stop using our products contrary to their agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In\naddition, certain negative actions taken or statements made by those associated with our products or brands, could impact or harm the reputations of our\nconsumer products, and our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions that may be taken or statements that may be made by\nthem, could impact have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Poor or non-performance by those associated with our products, a failure to\ncontinue to correctly identify promising public figures, music artists, automotive designers, sound studios, social media influencers or other endorsers to use\nour products and brands or a failure to enter into cost-effective fee arrangements with any of such endorsers could adversely affect our brands, reputation, sales\nand profitability.\nItem 5.

We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,”\n“forecast,” “see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking\nstatements. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties\nand changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise. Readers of these presentations are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be no assurance that these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in these presentations. The\nrisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings,\nare available online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordancewith U.S. GAAP. The non-\nGAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items\nassist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the\nCompany’s on-going core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated\nwith the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in\naddition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company has presented the following non-\nGAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) constant currency revenue growth\n%, (ii) non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, (iii) non-GAAP SG&A expense, (iv) non-GAAP R&D expense, (v) non-GAAP litigation settlements and (awards), (vi) non-\nGAAP operating expense %, (vii) non-GAAP operating income/margin %, (viii) non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, (ix) adjusted free cash flow and (x) adjusted\nEBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core operating results with those of other\ncompanies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to\nbetter understand and evaluate our business. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section\nof the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\nTable of Contents\nMasimo Overview 4\nConsumer Health & Audio 7\nProfessional Healthcare & Telemonitoring 20\nFinancial Outlook & Sustainability 42\nAppendices: GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 55\nMasimo at a Glance: Global Leader in Differentiated Medical Technology\n61%/39% 1,700+\n$2.3-$2.4B ~825 $171B+\nHealthcare / Healthcare and\nConsolidated Engineers Total Market\nNon-Healthcare Consumer\nRevenue (2023E¹) Globally Opportunity²\nRevenue Split Focused Patents\nHealthcare Revenue Mix Non-Healthcare Revenue Mix\n(2023E) (2023E)\nHeadphones\nHospital Automation\nSedLine & O3\nNomoLine\nSmartspeakers\nOther\nSoundbars\nrainbow®\nHome Audio\nAVR\nSET®\nComponent +\nHiFi\nGrowing at 9%-11% between 2023-2028 Growing at 4%-6% between 2023-2028\n1. 2023 Consolidated Revenue Guidance of $2,330 to $2,400 million\n2.

          "content": "Non-GAAP Measures,\nAdjustments and\nDefinitions\nUpdated August 6, 2024\n© 2019 Masimo\nForward-Looking Statements\nMasimo Corporation (“Masimo”, “MASI”, or the “Company”) cautions you that statements included in this\npresentation that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks,\nuncertainties, assumptions and other factors which, if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause\nthe Company’s results to differ materially and adversely from historical results or those expressed or\nimplied by such forward-looking statements.\nFurther information on Masimo’s disclaimer and forward-looking statements and the potential risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially are more fully described in the Company’s\npress releases and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Measures & Adjustments\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as constant currency revenue growth, non-\nGAAP gross profit/margin percentage, non-GAAP SG&A expense percentage, non-GAAP R&D expense\npercentage, non-GAAP operating income/margin percentage, non-GAAP provision for income taxes/tax rate,\nnon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash\nflow. These non-GAAP financial measures may include certain adjustments related to the following items:\n> Constant currency revenue adjustments\n> Acquisitions, integrations, divestitures, and related costs\n> Acquired tangible asset amortization\n> Acquired intangible asset amortization\n> Litigation related expenses and settlements (prior definition)\n> Litigation related expenses and settlements (updated definition)\n> Business transition and related costs\n> Realized and unrealized gains or losses\n> Financing related adjustments\n> Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments\n> Tax events\n> Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense\n> Other adjustments\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Measures & Adjustments (continued)\nThe Company also uses non-GAAP liquidity measures such as adjusted free cash flow, which excludes\ncertain cash items related to the foregoing that may impact period-to-period comparability, and adjusted\nEBITDA, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to enable it to further and more consistently\nanalyze the period-to-period financial performance and liquidity of its core business operations, which are\ngenerally designated as “non-GAAP” measures herein. Management believes that providing investors with\nthese non-GAAP financial measures gives investors additional information to enable them to assess, in the\nsame way management assesses, the Company’s current and future core operating performance. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs and\nexpenditures associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with\nGAAP. Therefore, investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as\na substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest\ncomparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s\nwebsite.\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Definitions\n> Constant currency revenue adjustments\n▪ Some of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThese foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary significantly from period-to-period\ndepending on the average and quarter-end exchange rates during a respective period. We believe that comparing these\nforeign currency denominated revenues by holding the exchange rates constant with the prior year period is useful to\nmanagement and investors in evaluating our revenue growth rates on a period-to-period basis. We anticipate that\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the related constant currency adjustments for calculation of our revenue\ngrowth rate will continue to occur in future periods.\n> Acquisitions, integrations, divestitures, and related costs\n▪ These transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with acquisitions, integrations,\ninvestments, divestitures, assets impairments, and in-process research and development.\n> Acquired tangible asset amortization\n▪ These transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with\nacquired tangible assets and asset valuation step-ups.\n> Acquired intangible asset amortization\n▪ These transactions represent amortization expense in connection with business or assets acquisitions associated with\nacquired intangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property, trade names and non-\ncompetition agreements.\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Definitions (continued)\n> Litigation related expenses and settlements (prior definition)\n▪ These transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with certain litigation matters, which can\nvary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results.\n> Litigation related expenses and settlements (updated definition)\nWe have been engaged in various legal proceedings against Apple since January 2020, including various proceedings in\n■\nthe federal courts, various proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO proceedings”), and a\nproceeding in the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC proceeding”). Although we previously excluded only\nexpenses relating to the ITC proceeding from the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements”, beginning\nwith the first quarter of 2024, we have revised the definition of “Litigation related expenses and settlements” to exclude\nnot only expenses relating to the ITC proceeding, but also all other Apple litigation expenses, including those relating to\nthe federal court proceedings and the PTO proceedings. We believe all of the Apple litigation expenses are unique in\nnature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance, and this updated definition will provide more\nuseful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance that otherwise\nmay be obscured by the significant fluctuations in Apple-related litigation expenses.\n> Business transition and related costs\n▪ These transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with business transition plans. These\nitems may include but are not limited to severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, asset impairment, and\nother related costs to rationalize our operational footprint and optimize business results.\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Definitions (continued)\n> Realized and unrealized gains or losses\n▪ These transactions represent gains, losses, and other related costs associated with foreign currency denominated\ntransactions and investments. Changes in the underlying currency rates relative to the U.S. Dollar may result in realized\nand unrealized foreign currency gains and losses between the time these receivables and payables arise and the time\nthat they are settled in cash. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments may impact the Company’s\nreported results of operations for a period. These items are highly variable, difficult to predict and outside the control of\nthose responsible for the underlying operations of the business. Other items also included here are mark-to-market gains\nand losses of derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments or the ineffective portions of cash flow\nhedges.\n> Financing related adjustments\n▪ The Company may enter into various financial arrangements whereby costs are incurred and certain instrument features\nare valued and expensed accordingly but are not necessarily indicative of the on-going cash flow generation of the\nCompany and therefore excludes these costs from non-GAAP earnings. For GAAP earnings per diluted share purposes,\nthe Company cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact, if applicable, in its diluted shares calculations. However, the\nCompany believes that reflecting the anti-dilutive impact of these instruments in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share\nprovides management and investors with useful information in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a\nper share basis.\n> Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments\n▪ In order to reflect the tax effected impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, the Company will adjust the non-GAAP earnings\nby the approximate tax impact of these adjustments.\n© 2019 Masimo\nNon-GAAP Definitions (continued)\n> Tax events\n▪ This represents certain tax events that impact period over period comparability and do not represent the underlying\nongoing results of the core operations. The Company may choose to exclude these tax events from non-GAAP earnings.\n> Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense\n▪ GAAP requires that excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense be reflected in our provision\nfor income taxes rather than paid-in capital. As these excess tax benefits may be highly variable from period-to-period,\nthe Company may choose to exclude these tax benefits from non-GAAP earnings to facilitate comparability between\nperiods and with peers.\n> Adjusted free cash flow\n▪ Represents free cash flow (cash flow from operations less cash used in the purchase of property, plant and equipment)\nadjusted for the impact of cash receipts or payments relating to certain previously described non-GAAP adjustments,\nwhich may impact period-to-period comparability.\n> Adjusted EBITDA\n▪ Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the\napplicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described, and further excluding non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense.\n> Other adjustments\n▪ In the event there are gains, losses and other adjustments which impact period-to-period comparability and do not\nrepresent the underlying ongoing results of the business, the Company may choose to exclude these from non-GAAP\nearnings.\n© 2019 Masimo"

          "content": "Third Quarter 2024 Earnings\nNovember 5, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor Statement\nForward-Looking Statements: This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our\nexpectations, plans, strategies or prospects.We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,” “forecast,”\n“see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.Such statements are based upon the current\nbeliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be\nno assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The\nrisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov,\nwww.masimo.com or upon request.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in\nmaking comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating\nperformance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined\nin accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The\nCompany has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue\n(constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A\nexpense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense,non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment charge, non-GAAP operating expense %\n(prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP non-operating income (expense), non-GAAP provision for\nincome taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated definition),non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and\nupdated definition). These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core operating results with those of other companies.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our\nbusiness. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.investor.masimo.com to\naccess Supplementary Financial Information.\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related\nto acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and related costs; business transition and related costs; litigation related expenses and settlements; realized and unrealized gains or losses; tax\nrelated adjustments; and other adjustments. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable\nforward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions\nis difficult to predict because management's plans may change.

Masimo had previously only excluded the expenses related to the U.S. International Trade Commission\nlitigation against Apple. Masimo believes all Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance and is therefore excluding them from its non-GAAP financial measures.\n(3) Guidance provided November 5, 2024.

          "content": "Second Quarter 2024 Earnings\nAugust 6, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our expectations,\nplans, strategies or prospects.We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,”\n“forecast,” “see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking\nstatements.Such statements are based upon the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and\nchanges in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the\ndate they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be no assurance that these forward-\nlooking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are\navailable online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-\nGAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items\nassist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the\nCompany’s on-going core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated\nwith the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in\naddition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company has presented the following non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-\nforma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-GAAP SG&A\nexpense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense,non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment charge, non-GAAP\noperating expense % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP non-operating\nincome (expense), non-GAAP provision for income taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition and updated\ndefinition),non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and updated definition). This presentation also includes certain preliminary estimated information of\na potential separation of the Company’s consumer business for illustrative and informational purposes and further adjusted for separation items. See “Disclaimer\nRegarding Potential Separation” on the next slide for additional information. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of\nthe company’s core operating results with those of other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the\nCompany’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our business. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP\nreconciliations, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\n2\nDisclaimer Regarding Potential Separation\nOn March 22, 2024, Masimo announced that its Board of Directors has authorized management to evaluate a proposed separation of the company’s consumer\nbusiness (the “Potential Separation”). Masimo’s Board of Directors and management are in the process of evaluating the proposed structure of the Potential\nSeparation. Slide 9 of this presentation entitled “Preliminary Estimate: Financial Impact of a Potential Separation” (“Slide 9”) includes an estimate of the financial\nimpact of the Potential Separation; however, the estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes and does not purport to contain or present\nall information relating to any Potential Separation. Moreover, the method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation are still under consideration and\nhave not been determined, approved or finalized, and the final method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation, including the separation of assets and\nliabilities, may differ materially from what is presented and estimated on Slide 9. There can be no assurance that any Potential Separation that may be implemented\nwill be similar in structure to any of the structures illustrated or discussed on Slide 9, that any Potential Separation may be effected at all or the timing of any Potential\nSeparation. Additionally, the estimate on Slide 9 is an illustrative projection that was calculated using the midpoint of Masimo’s 2024 consolidated guidance, which is\nbased on management’s current expectations and beliefs, but is subject to uncertainty and risks, and also relies on a number of assumptions and adjustments as\ndescribed on Slide 9. Accordingly, all of the information on Slide 9 constitute “forward-looking statements” as described on Slide 2 of this presentation entitled “Safe\nHarbor Statement”. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, including in respect of the financial or operating\noutlook for the potential separated businesses (including, without limitation, the realization of any expected efficiencies or cost savings).\nThe forward-looking statements on Slide 9 are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control and\ncould cause the actual results of any Potential Separation to differ materially and adversely from those illustrated on Slide 9 as a result of various risk factors,\nincluding, but not limited to: risks related to the ability to effect or complete any Potential Separation on the terms described on Slide 9, or at all, and to meet any of the\nconditions related thereto; the approval of any Potential Separation by Masimo’s Board of Directors; the ability of the separated businesses to be successful;\nexpectations around the financial impact of any Potential Separation; potential uncertainty during the pendency of any Potential Separation that could affect Masimo’s\nfinancial performance; the possibility that any Potential Separation will not be completed within the anticipated time period or at all; the possibility that any Potential\nSeparation will not achieve its intended benefits; the possibility of disruption, including changes to existing business relationships, disputes, litigation or unanticipated\ncosts in connection with any Potential Separation; the impact that any Potential Separation may have on our employees; the uncertainty of the expected financial\nperformance of Masimo prior to and following completion of any Potential Separation; negative effects of the announcement or pendency of any Potential Separation\non the market price of Masimo’s securities and/or on the financial performance of Masimo; evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes; changes in general economic\nand/or industry specific conditions; actions by third parties, including government agencies; as well as other factors more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are\navailable online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nExcept as required by applicable law, Masimo assumes no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any duty or obligation to, provide any additional or updated\ninformation or to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results, or otherwise. Nothing in this presentation\nwill, under any circumstances (including by reason of this presentation remaining available and not being superseded or replaced by any other presentation or\npublication with respect to Masimo or the Potential Separation), create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of Masimo or any Potential\nSeparation since the date of this presentation.\n3\nExecutive Summary | Second Quarter 2024(1)\n• Healthcare revenue was $344 million, representing 22% reported growth and 23% constant currency growth(2).\nMasimo’s\n• Masimo’s successful and aggressive focus on expanding its footprint with existing customers and winning new\nHealthcare\ncustomers has built a solid foundation for resuming growth now that hospital census has returned to normal levels.\nBusiness\nRemains on Incremental value of new healthcare contracts(3) was $134 million, representing a 28% increase from Q2 2023.\no\nTrack for\nUnrecognized contract revenue(4) was $1.6 billion, representing a 16% increase from Q2 2023.\nGrowth o\nDriver shipments(5) were 58,600; exceeding management’s estimate of 55,000.\no\n• Consolidated revenue was $496 million, including Healthcare revenues of $344 million and Non-Healthcare revenues\nof $152 million.\n• Non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, representing 13% growth; favorable to guidance midpoint(6) by $0.10 (or 13%).\nConsolidated\nRevenue and o Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.2%, representing 420 basis points of year-over-year improvement.\nEarnings\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $73 million, representing 7% growth.\no\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 15%, which improved sequentially from the first quarter but declined modestly versus last\no\nyear due to the return of performance-based compensation to normalized levels in 2024.\n• Operating cash flow was $75 million due to strong earnings and initiatives to improve working capital.\nOther\n• Total debt was $782 million as of Q2 2024, resulting from $93 million of debt paydown during the quarter.\nHighlights\n• Net debt was $649 million as of Q2 2024.\nNotes:\n1.

Masimo\nexpects that any potential separation would result in a full deconsolidation of the financial statements for the separated business. Masimo is currently evaluating all\noptions including (1) the sale of a majority stake in the consumer audio and consumer health businesses (“Joint Venture”), (2) a sale of the consumer audio business\n(“Sound United”) or (3) a spin-off of the consumer audio and consumer health businesses to shareholders.\nAs illustrated above, if a separation is completed, Masimo expects that the separation will improve the profitability of the healthcare business (“RemainCo”).\n• The financial information above assumes a separation of the consumer business without cash proceeds (e.g., spin-off).\n• If a separation transaction (e.g., sale of the consumer audio and consumer health businesses or sale of Sound United only) results in cash proceeds to Masimo, there\nwould be an opportunity to pay down debt (currently ~$782 million) and reduce interest expense (currently ~$40 million, which represents ~$0.55 per share).\n• “Consumer Health and Other Separation Adjustments” above includes adjustments for consumer health product revenues, cost of goods sold, research and\ndevelopment expenses, selling and marketing expenses and certain corporate expenses.\nNotes:\n1. This preliminary estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes. Masimo is currently evaluating the structure of any potential separation of its consumer business, and the method, structure, timing and terms of any such potential\nseparation are still under consideration and have not been determined, approved or finalized.

Masimo believes all Apple litigation expenses are unique in nature and not indicative of the Company’s on-going operating performance and is therefore excluding them from its non-GAAP financial measures.\nRevenue\n(Unaudited; in millions, except percentages) (1,3)\nQuarterly Performance Year to Date Q3 2024 Guidance (2) Full Year FY 2024 Guidance (2)\nQ1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 YTD 2023 YTD 2024 Low High FY 2022 FY 2023 Low High\nRevenue\nHealthcare 346.7 281.1 307.8 339.9 339.6 343.9 ### 627.8 683.5 335 345 1,340.3 1,275.5 1,385 1,405\nNon-Healthcare 218.3 174.2 171.1 209.0 153.2 152.4 392.6 305.6 160 170 695.5 772.6 700 730\nGAAP revenue $565.0 $455.3 $478.9 $548.9 $492.8 $496.3 $1,020.3 $989.1 $495 $515 $2,035.8 $2,048.1 $2,085 $2,135\nHealthcare 5.6 2.0 (0.7) (1.1) 1.5 1.8 7.6 3.4 1 1 30.0 5.8 3 3\nNon-Healthcare N/A N/A (1.5) (3.6) 1.0 3.0 N/A 4.0 1 1 N/A N/A 2 2\nConstant currency adjustments $5.6 $2.0 ($2.2) ($4.7) $2.5 $4.8 $7.6 $7.4 $2 $2 $30.0 $5.8 $6 $6\nHealthcare 352.3 283.1 307.1 338.8 341.1 345.7 635.4 686.8 336 346 1,370.4 1,281.3 1,388 1,408\nNon-Healthcare 218.3 174.2 169.6 205.4 154.2 155.4 392.6 309.6 161 171 695.5 772.6 702 732\nNon-GAAP revenue (constant currency) $570.6 $457.3 $476.7 $544.2 $495.3 $501.1 $1,027.9 $996.5 $497 $517 $2,065.9 $2,053.9 $2,091 $2,141\nHealthcare 14.0% -21.3% -5.9% -3.4% -2.1% 22.4% -5.1% 8.9% 9% 12% 8.2% -4.8% 9% 10%\nNon-Healthcare N/A N/A -23.0% -21.2% -29.8% -12.5% 88.5% -22.1% -6% -1% N/A N/A -9% -6%\nGAAP revenue growth 85.7% -19.5% -12.8% -11.0% -12.8% 9.0% 17.3% -3.1% 3% 8% 64.3% 0.6% 2% 4%\nHealthcare 15.8% -20.7% -6.1% -3.7% -1.6% 23.0% -3.9% 9.4% 9% 12% 10.6% -4.4% 9% 10%\nNon-Healthcare N/A N/A -23.6% -22.5% -29.4% -10.8% 88.5% -21.1% -6% 0% N/A N/A -9% -5%\nNon-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency) 87.6% -19.1% -13.2% -11.8% -12.3% 10.1% 18.2% -2.3% 4% 8% 66.7% 0.9% 2% 5%\nPro Forma Revenue (4)\nHealthcare 346.7 281.1 307.8 339.9 339.6 343.9 627.8 683.5 335 345 1,340.3 1,275.5 1,385 1,405\nNon-Healthcare 218.3 174.2 171.1 209.0 153.2 152.4 392.6 305.6 160 170 953.0 772.6 700 730\nGAAP revenue $565.0 $455.3 $478.9 $548.9 $492.8 $496.3 $1,020.3 $989.1 $495 $515 $2,293.4 $2,048.1 $2,085 $2,135\nHealthcare 5.6 2.0 (0.7) (1.1) 1.5 1.8 7.6 3.4 1 1 30.0 5.8 3 3\nNon-Healthcare 9.5 3.5 (1.5) (3.6) 1.0 3.0 13.0 4.0 1 1 58.3 8.0 2 2\nConstant currency adjustments $15.1 $5.5 ($2.2) ($4.7) $2.5 $4.8 $20.6 $7.4 $2 $2 $88.3 $13.8 $6 $6\nHealthcare 352.3 283.1 307.1 338.8 341.1 345.7 635.4 686.8 336 346 1,370.4 1,281.3 1,388 1,408\nNon-Healthcare 227.8 177.7 169.6 205.4 154.2 155.4 405.6 309.6 161 171 1,011.3 780.6 702 732\nNon-GAAP revenue (constant currency) $580.1 $460.8 $476.7 $544.2 $495.3 $501.1 $1,040.9 $996.5 $497 $517 $2,381.7 $2,061.9 $2,091 $2,141\nHealthcare 14.0% -21.3% -5.9% -3.4% -2.1% 22.4% -5.1% 8.9% 9% 12% 8.2% -4.8% 9% 10%\nNon-Healthcare -12.9% -19.0% -23.0% -21.2% -29.8% -12.5% -15.7% -22.1% -6% -1% 4.9% -18.9% -9% -6%\nGAAP revenue growth 1.8% -20.4% -12.8% -11.0% -12.8% 9.0% -9.5% -3.1% 3% 8% 6.8% -10.7% 2% 4%\nHealthcare 15.8% -20.7% -6.1% -3.7% -1.6% 23.0% -3.9% 9.4% 9% 12% 10.6% -4.4% 9% 10%\nNon-Healthcare -9.1% -17.4% -23.6% -22.5% -29.4% -10.8% -12.9% -21.1% -6% 0% 11.3% -18.1% -9% -5%\nNon-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency) 4.6% -19.5% -13.2% -11.8% -12.3% 10.1% -7.6% -2.3% 4% 8% 10.9% -10.1% 2% 5%\nNotes:\n(1) Totals may not foot due to rounding.

          "content": "First Quarter 2024 Earnings\nMay 7, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, among others, statements about our expectations,\nplans, strategies or prospects. We generally use the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,” “target,”\n“forecast,” “see,” “seek,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” “work toward,” and similar\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements.All statements other than statements of historical or current fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking\nstatements. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of management and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties\nand changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date they are made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise. Readers of this presentation are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, since there can be no assurance that these forward-\nlooking statements will prove to be accurate.This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. The risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from Masimo’s current expectations are more fully described in Masimo’s reports filed with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are\navailable online at www.sec.gov, www.masimo.com or upon request.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-\nGAAP financial measures presented exclude certain items that are more fully described in the Appendix. Management believes that adjustments for these items\nassist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the\nCompany’s on-going core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated\nwith the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in\naddition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company has presented the following non-\nGAAP financial measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: non-GAAP revenue (constant\ncurrency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue (constant currency), pro-forma non-GAAP revenue growth (constant currency), non-GAAP gross profit/margin %, non-\nGAAP SG&A expense (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP litigation settlements and awards, non-GAAP impairment\ncharge, non-GAAP operating expense % (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP operating profit/margin % (prior definition and updated definition), non-\nGAAP non-operating income (expense), non-GAAP provision for income taxes (prior definition and updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) (prior definition\nand updated definition), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (prior definition and updated definition). This presentation also includes certain preliminary estimated\ninformation of a potential separation for illustrative and informational purposes and further adjusted for separation items. See “Disclaimer Regarding Potential\nSeparation” on the next slide for additional information. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the company’s core\noperating results with those of other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important in the evaluation of the Company’s\nperformance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our business. For additional financial details, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations,\nplease visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\n2\nDisclaimer Regarding Potential Separation\nOn March 22, 2024, Masimo announced that its Board of Directors has authorized management to evaluate a proposed separation of the company’s consumer business (the\n“Potential Separation”). Masimo’s Board of Directors and management are in the process of evaluating the proposed structure of the Potential Separation. Slide 7 of this\npresentation entitled “Preliminary Estimate: Financial Impact of a Potential Separation” (“Slide 7”) includes an estimate of the financial impact of the Potential Separation; however,\nthe estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes and does not purport to contain or present all information relating to any Potential Separation.\nMoreover, the method, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation are still under consideration and have not been determined, approved or finalized, and the final\nmethod, structure, timing and terms of any Potential Separation, including the separation of assets and liabilities, may differ materially from what is presented and estimated on\nSlide 7. There can be no assurance that any Potential Separation that may be implemented will be similar in structure to the structure illustrated on Slide 7, that any Potential\nSeparation may be effected at all or the timing of any Potential Separation. Additionally, the estimate on Slide 7 is an illustrative projection that was calculated using the midpoint of\nMasimo’s 2024 consolidated guidance, which is based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, but is subject to uncertainty and risks, and also relies on a number of\nassumptions and adjustments as described on Slide 7. Accordingly, all of the information on Slide 7 is a “forward-looking statement” as described on Slide 2 of this presentation\nentitled “Safe Harbor Statement”.

Masimo is committed to pursuing a separation that would result\nin two separate companies (consumer and professional healthcare). Masimo expects that any potential separation would result in a full deconsolidation of the financial statements for the two businesses.\nMasimo expects that the separated entity (“NewCo”) will include its consumer audio (including hearables) and consumer health products (including the Stork baby monitor and the Freedom smart watch and band). Masimo\nwould retain its professional healthcare and telehealth products.\nAs illustrated above, if a separation is completed, Masimo expects that the separation will improve the profitability of the healthcare business (“RemainCo”).\n• The financial information above assumes a separation of the consumer business without cash proceeds (e.g., spin-off). If a separation transaction (e.g., sale) results in cash proceeds to Masimo, there would be an\nopportunity to pay down debt (currently ~$876 million) and reduce interest expense (currently ~$47 million, which represents ~$0.63 per share).\n• “Additional Separation Adjustments” above includes adjustments for consumer health product revenues, cost of goods sold, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, certain corporate\nexpenses and the assumed sharing of Apple litigation costs (GAAP only) equally between RemainCo and NewCo.\n(1) This preliminary estimate is being provided solely for illustrative and informational purposes. Masimo is currently evaluating the structure of any potential separation of its consumer business, and the method, structure, timing and terms of any such potential separation are\nstill under consideration and have not been determined, approved or finalized.
