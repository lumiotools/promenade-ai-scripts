For the third quarter, we generated $5.8 million in sales. While this reflects a slight decline from the previous year, it does align with our strategic focus on building high margin recurring subscription revenue, that typically renew for many years, rather than relying on one-time sales. As a result of this strategy, we are pleased to report our gross profit increased by 8.7% and our gross margin increased by over 400 basis points for the third quarter of 2024. Our primary objective remains the same - securing high margin service agreements on our enterprise infrastructure platform, which create a more stable revenue foundation and support long-term growth and profitability.”\n\n“These results highlight the success of our growth strategy, including expanding partnerships with major industry players, launching a new data center in Chicago, and establishing a presence in the UK. First, we expanded our relationship with a billion-dollar insurance firm to enhance its cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity, reaffirming our role as a trusted provider for large, compliance-driven organizations. In healthcare, we secured a contract with a leading medical center for compliant cloud hosting, further strengthening our position in this highly regulated sector. Additionally, we secured a six-figure contract with a music publishing organization in education, demonstrating our adaptability to meet data-intensive needs across diverse industries. These agreements highlight our strategic focus on sectors requiring secure, scalable cloud based solutions. Furthermore, our strategically located new data center in Chicago strengthens our ability to support our growing U.S. customer base, ensuring we meet our clients’ needs with reliability and capacity.”\n\n“In addition, our recent expansion into the UK market, along with the successful integration of Flagship Solutions, has further strengthened our global presence and operational efficiency, positioning us for accelerated growth and global reach. We also recently announced the appointment of Colin Freeman as Managing Director of UK Cloud Host Technologies Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CloudFirst Technologies, an important step in our strategy to expand across the European market and deliver our solutions to this key market. With Colin’s extensive leadership experience, we are confident he will be instrumental in accelerating our growth in the region. In addition to his appointment, we are establishing strategic infrastructure deployment in data centers in the UK, positioning us to make a strong entry and enhance our footprint in this key market. These achievements are important to our organic growth strategy, allowing us to capture new opportunities and broaden our impact. We’re proud of our progress in expanding contracts, extending our international reach, and increasing industry prominence.” \n\nChris Panagiotakos, CFO of Data Storage Corporation, added, “We are in a strong financial position with approximately $11.9 million in cash and marketable securities and no long-term debt, providing us the flexibility to make strategic investments, keeping us well-prepared to pursue growth opportunities that deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to continuing to carefully manage expenses and execute on our growth strategy.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company plans to host a conference call at 11:00 am ET today, to discuss the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2024 which ended September 30, 2024, as well as corporate progress and other developments.\n\nThe conference call will be available via telephone by dialing toll-free 877-451-6152 for U.S. callers or for international callers +1-201-389-0879.

          "content": "Appendix\nKey Benefits:\n1. Tax Treaties:\n• U.S.-Canada Tax Treaty: This treaty helps prevent double taxation for businesses and individuals operating in both countries. It allows companies to avoid\nbeing taxed twice on the same income, provides tax exemptions for certain types of income, and reduces withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and\nroyalties .\n• U.K.-Canada Tax Treaty: Similar to the U.S.-Canada tax treaty, the U.K.-Canada agreement prevents double taxation and reduces withholding tax rates.\nThis facilitates smoother cross-border business operations and investment between the two countries.\n2. Trade Agreements:\n• Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA): This agreement simplifies trade between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico by removing tariffs on most\ngoods, reducing trade barriers, and creating a more integrated North American market. For U.S. companies with Canadian branches, this treaty improves\ntrade conditions and operational ease.\n• Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA): The U.K. has carried over parts of CETA post-Brexit for its relations with Canada. This\nagreement reduces tariffs, makes it easier for businesses to bid on government contracts, and improves market access for both U.K. and Canadian firms.\n3. Work and Immigration Benefits:\n• Many treaties also provide special provisions for workers. For example, professionals, business travelers, and intra-company transferees from the U.S. or\nU.K. often benefit from simplified visa processes when working in Canada, making it easier to move employees between countries.\nThese treaties create a favorable environment for businesses to expand across borders by reducing tax burdens, facilitating trade, and making cross-border labor\nmovement easier.\nDTST"
