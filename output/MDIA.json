This is provided for reference purposes only.\nIn the event of any discrepancy between the Japanese original and the English translation,\nthe Japanese original shall prevail.\nSpeakers\nYasushi Fujita, President and CEO, MEDIA DO Co., Ltd.\nHiroshi Kanda, Vice President and CFO, MEDIA DO Co., Ltd.\n1\nContents\nHiroshi Kanda (hereinafter, Kanda): Thank you very much for joining the financial results\nbriefing of MEDIA DO Co., Ltd. for the six months ended August 31, 2024.\nToday, I, as Vice President and CFO, will explain the financial highlights and performance\ntrends, and Mr. Fujita, President and CEO, will explain our growth strategy.\n2\nExecutive Summary\nPlease find the executive summary shown on the slide for your later reference.\n3\nConsolidated Performance Highlights\nThis slide shows the consolidated performance highlights for the six months ended August\n31, 2024. Net sales amounted to 51,057 million yen, EBITDA 1,746 million yen, operating\nprofit 1,096 million yen, and profit attributable to owners of parent came in at 521 million yen.\nIn the eBook distribution business, we acquired new sales channels in February this year, in\naddition to achieving a growth rate higher than the previous fiscal year in existing sales\nchannels. As a result, net sales increased by 4,660 million yen, or 10.0%, year on year.\nAlong with this, profit also improved, with EBITDA up by 111 million yen year on year, and\noperating profit up by 103 million yen year on year.\nIn addition to the eBook distribution business, we achieved improvement in profit in the\nstrategic investment businesses, specifically in the IP solutions business. As a result,\noperating profit increased by 10.4% year on year.\nMeanwhile, profit attributable to owners of parent improved by 12 million yen, up 2.2% year\non year. Although we improved profit as I just mentioned, due to our publishing subsidiary,\nJIVE, withdrawing from the print book business to focus on the production and sale of\neBooks, we recorded a loss on liquidation of business of approximately 23 million yen. As a\nresult, the profit growth rate remained at a low level.\n4\nFull-Year Performance Achievement Rate\nHere are the progress rates against the full-year performance forecasts. In terms of net\nsales, we have achieved a progress rate of 52.1% against the full-year forecast of 98 billion\nyen. Compared to our initial forecast, the growth rate of net sales, particularly from new\nsales channels, has been higher than anticipated, resulting in a progress rate exceeding\n50%.\nOn the other hand, the progress rates for profits are all below 50%. This is because we\nanticipate improvement in the strategic investment businesses in the second half of the fiscal\nyear. While the progress rates appear lower compared to net sales, the results have\nexceeded our expectations.\nAt any rate, we saw an improvement in profit in the second quarter as contrasted with the\nfirst quarter. While the first quarter saw a year-on-year increase in net sales but decrease in\nprofit, both net sales and profit increased in the second quarter. As we previously\ncommunicated, we would shift from the phase of declining sales and profit over the past two\nconsecutive years to a phase of increasing both sales and profit this fiscal year. We are\npleased that the second quarter clearly demonstrated progress in this regard.\n5\nNet Sales by Segment (2Q)\nLet me explain net sales by segment. As you see in the vertical columns on the slide, we\nhave two reportable segments: the eBook distribution business and the strategic investment\nbusinesses. However, in our quarterly securities report and other reports, net sales are\npresented according to the business segments in the horizontal rows.\nThe business segments consist of five categories: distribution, book and magazine\npublishing, web service operation, solutions for publishing industry, and other. Each of these\nsegments except for the book and magazine publishing segment shown in the second row\nfrom the top experienced a year-on-year increase in net sales. For the book and magazine\npublishing segment, net sales of the subsidiary NIHONBUNGEISHA declined year on year.\nHowever, in the figures shown on the slide, eBook sales out of the total sales of\nNIHONBUNGEISHA have been eliminated for consolidation purposes. While\nU ’\noverall sales have not significantly decreased. I would like to reassure you on that point.\n6\nU\nU\nOverview\nLet me explain the earnings trends, starting with the consolidated performance. The graph\non the left side of the slide shows the trends in consolidated net sales, divided into two\ncategories: the navy bars representing net sales and the gray bars representing special\nfactors. The special factors refer to the net sales from LINE Manga transferred in the second\nhalf of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023. Net sales shown in navy, which indicate our\nsubstantive performance excluding the special factors, have achieved a record high.\nIn addition, even when including the special factors, net sales increased year on year. The\ngraph clearly shows that, after periods of declining net sales, we have been on a steady\ngrowth trend starting this quarter.\nThe graph on the right side of the slide shows the trends in EBITDA and operating profit.\nEBITDA and operating profit for the second quarter alone was 953 million yen and 621\nmillion yen, respectively. Both figures represent a year-on-year increase in profit, and each\nhas reached record highs since the transfer of LINE Manga started in the fiscal year ended\nFebruary 28, 2023.\n7\nSales Trend (by Segment)\nThe graph on the slide shows net sales trends by segment. As mentioned earlier, the impact\nof LINE Manga in the eBook distribution business is shown in gray as the special factor, the\namount excluding this factor is shown in navy, and net sales of strategic investment\nbusinesses are represented in light blue.\nStarting from the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, we experienced fluctuations in net\nsales due to M&A activities, such as the acquisition that made Everystar a wholly owned\nsubsidiary, the acquisition of Supadü Limited in the U.K., and the sale of Nagisa. However, in\nthis second quarter, we achieved record highs driven by organic business growth, generating\nsolid net sales not only in the eBook distribution business but also in the strategic investment\nbusinesses.\n8\nOperating Profit Trend (by Segment)\nLet me explain the operating profit trends by segment. As shown in the rightmost bar graph,\noperating profit for the second quarter alone was 621 million yen. While the eBook\ndistribution business generated a profit of 1,253 million yen, the strategic investment\nbusinesses recorded an operating loss of 218 million yen, and there was a negative\nadjustment amount of 413 million yen.\nThe adjustment amount includes headquarters expenses and an operating loss of the\ncompany managing TOKUSHIMA GAMBAROUS, a professional basketball team that has\nbeen in the B3 League since October 2023.\n9\nU U\nU U\nTrends in Royalties and Other Costs\nThe slide shows the trends of royalties and other costs as a reference. Since the transfer of\nLINE Manga started in the second half of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, both net\nsales as well as royalties and related costs temporarily decreased. However, both have\nsteadily grown since then, returning to a trend of increasing net sales.\n10\nU\nTrends in Cost of Sales/SG&A Expenses (Excluding Royalties)\nThe graph on the slide shows the trends in cost of sales and SG&A expenses, excluding\nroyalties and related costs. The rightmost part of the graph represents the figures for the\nsecond quarter alone of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2025, totaling 2,849 million yen.\nLooking at past levels, we believe the trend has not substantially changed.\n11\nU U\nTrends in the Number of Employees\nThe trends in the number of employees are shown in the graph on the slide. Please refer to\nthis slide for reference.\n12\nU\nTrends in Net Sales and Operating Profit\nLet me explain the performance trends of the eBook distribution business. The graph on the\nleft side of the slide shows the trends in net sales. The sales from LINE Manga are shown in\ngray as the special factor, while other sales are represented in navy.\nCompared to the second half of the fiscal year ended February 23, 2023, when the transfer\nof LINE Manga started, net sales excluding the special factors have reached a record high.\nFurthermore, even excluding the special factors, net sales increased in comparison with the\nsame period last year.\nThe graph on the right side of the slide shows the trends in operating profit. Operating profit\nfor the second quarter alone in the eBook distribution business reached 1,253 million yen,\nlanding at nearly the same level as the first quarter.\nCompared to the first quarter, the operating profit margin slightly decreased due to two\nfactors. First, the sales composition ratio of major publishers with lower commission rates\nincreased in the second quarter. Second, the amount of capitalized personnel costs for\nengineers decreased.\n13\nCost Structure (Cost of Sales/SG&A Expenses Excluding Royalties)\nLet me explain the cost structure of the eBook distribution business. The graph in the slide\nshows the trends in the cost of sales and SG&A expenses, excluding royalties and other\ncosts. The navy bars represent the cost of sales, excluding royalties and other costs.\nLooking at the fiscal year ending February 28, 2025, the cost of sales slightly increased in\nthe first quarter, followed by another small increase in the second quarter. As explained\nduring the previous financial results briefing, there was a personnel reassignment within the\nteam. As a result, while the total cost remained unchanged, the expenses were charged to\ncost of sales instead of SG&A expenses.\nCost of sales for the second quarter increased quarter on quarter, and this includes\npersonnel expenses for engineers. Specifically, regarding personnel expenses for engineers,\nas operational activities like maintenance increase instead of development, the capitalized\namount decreases. As a result, it appears that the cost has increased.\nThis is the main reason why the cost of sales for the second quarter increased quarter on\nquarter. Please note that the total personnel expenses for engineers did not significantly\nincrease; rather, the changes in the capitalized amount are the primary factor. Therefore, we\nexpect this figure to normalize again from the third quarter onward.\n14\nTrends in Net Sales and Operating Profit\nLet me explain the performance trends of the strategic investment businesses. As shown in\nthe graph on the left side of the slide, net sales in the second quarter alone reached a record\nhigh. Additionally, operating loss has been the smallest since segmenting out the strategic\ninvestment businesses.\nThere are two major factors behind this. First, as announced last December, we partnered\nwith NTT DOCOMO, INC. to jointly launch an overseas eBook retailer, and sales from\ncommissioned work related to the preparation for this launch have been recorded from this\n’\nhits.\nAdditionally, as a one-time factor in the second quarter, we withdrew from the production of\noriginal works in the Vertical Scrolling Comic (VSC) business, as announced in April this\nyear. Due to this withdrawal, temporary sales were recorded in the second quarter. As a\nresult of this and other factors, we believe that we were able to reduce the operating loss in\nthe second quarter, compared to previous periods.\n15\nCost Structure\nLet me explain the cost structure. We do not believe there were any significant increases in\ncosts in the second quarter. There was a slight increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to\nhigher personnel expenses in the global business, driven by the weaker yen.\n16\nOperating Profit YoY Comparison\n’\non the leftmost side, there was an operating loss of 737 million yen for the first six months of\nthe previous fiscal year. However, an operating loss for the first six months of this fiscal year\nstands at 583 million yen, reflecting an improvement of approximately 150 million yen in\nterms of profitability.\nThe FanTop business, global business, and IP solutions business each showed recovery,\n“ ”\nOf the 179 million yen, 66 million yen was attributable to the one-time sales recorded in the\nsecond quarter as a result of withdrawal from the VSC business.\nAdditionally, the imprint business saw a decline in profit compared to last year.\nNIHONBUNGEISHA posted a loss of 83 million yen, and the performance of subsidiaries\nincluded in the imprint business, such as ARTRA ENTERTAINMENT and JIVE, deteriorated\ncompared to the previous fiscal year. These are the main factor behind this decline.\nGiven this situation, NIHONBUNGEISHA is actively promoting business restructuring, and\nthe year-on-year loss for the first six months was nearly the same as the year-on-year loss\nfor the first three month. We expect improvement from the second quarter onward, and do\nnot anticipate any further deterioration year on year.\nAt any rate, we are eager to turn the operating loss in the strategic investment businesses\ninto profit as soon as possible. To achieve this, we will continue to drive business growth and\nreview our business portfolio, focusing on improving our financial performance.\n17\nU\nU\nResults for 2Q FY25/2 (P/L)\nDetailed P/L figures are as shown on the slide.\n18\nResults for 2Q FY25/2 (B/S)\nDetailed B/S figures are shown on the slide.\n19\nThe Corporate Philosophy of MEDIA DO\nYasushi Fujita (hereinafter, Fujita): Let me explain our growth strategy. As part of our\ncorporate “U\n”\nWe aim to deliver eBooks to as many readers as possible by distributing the content we\npurchase from publishers to as many eBook retailers as possible. For this reason, we uphold\n“ !”\n20\nPerformance Forecast for FY25/2 and Beyond\nLet me explain the performance outlook for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2025, and\nbeyond. Though we experienced declining net sales and profit over the past two years, we\nbelieve that we will return to a growth trend in both net sales and profit from this fiscal year.\nIn the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, we recorded our highest ever net sales of\napproximately 104,700 million yen. After that, however, LINE Manga, for which we had been\nthe exclusive content supplier since 2013, was no longer subject to exclusivity because we\nhad to purchase content from the Yahoo Group as a result of the business integration\nbetween LINE and Yahoo Japan.\nNevertheless, as the other projects continue to grow, we expect to return to an increase in\nboth net sales and profit starting this fiscal year.\n21\nYoY Net Sales Growth Rate\nThis slide presents the growth strategy for the eBook distribution business. The year-on-year\nnet sales growth rate was 103.5% by the end of the second quarter of the previous fiscal\nyear, and it has risen to 110.9% this fiscal year. Breaking it down, existing distribution\nchannels grew by 6.5%, and new distribution channels contributed a 4.4% increase, driving\nthe overall growth rate upward.\nIn the previous fiscal year, existing distribution channels grew by 6.5%, contributing to a\ngrowth rate of 103.5%. This represents an improvement of about 3 percentage points in the\ncurrent fiscal year. We believe this growth is the result of the strong marketing initiatives of\nour eBook retailers.\n22\nAs the Market Expands, the Diversification of Distribution Formats Expands the Room\n’\nLet me explain the reasons for the growth rate increase. First, the range of potential eBook\nusers has been expanding.\nThe graph on the slide shows paid users in navy and free users in gray. In 2023, the number\nof eBook users was 29.99 million, and the number has grown by approximately 3 million this\n“W ’ ”\nservice model.\nAlthough there are paid campaigns, there has been a significant rise in free campaigns as\nwell. In FY2018, there were 574,000 paid and free campaigns combined. In FY2023, this\nnumber had increased by 3.8 times, reaching 2,192,000 campaigns.\n23\nW\nExpand Market Share by Developing a Distribution System That Meets Current Trends\nwith High Development Capabilities\nIn addition to paid campaigns, the number of free campaigns and other complex events has\nbeen increasing. We work closely with publishers and eBook retailers, helping them design\nthese campaigns and ensuring the campaigns run smoothly. To this end, the campaign\noperating system and episode distribution management system we have developed are\nbeing utilized.\nUntil now, publishers have asked readers to purchase collected volumes of manga for 500\nyen, 600 yen, or 800 yen per book. Now, they divide the books into 10 parts and sell them on\na per-episode basis. Most of the episode distribution management systems used in this\nprocess are developed by us. By utilizing our systems, we aim to reduce errors during\ncampaigns and other similar activities.\nRegarding publishers, out of the 132 companies distributing episodes, 96 are using our\nsystem, giving us a market share of 73%. As for eBook retailers, 15 out of 17 companies\nhave implemented our system, with a market share of 88%.\nAs such, our episode distribution management system has become a dominant\ninfrastructure for the industry in recent years due to increasing demand, and we expect it to\nlead the industry going forward. Consequently, we anticipate a growing number of\nopportunities for publishers and retailers to use our distribution channels.\n24\nW\nProfit and Loss in Strategic Investment Businesses\nLet me explain the strategic investment businesses, starting with a summary. The vertical\naxis of the graph on the slide represents the scale of sales, with the upper part indicating\nbusinesses with larger sales and the lower part indicating those with smaller sales. The\nhorizontal axis represents operating profit compared to the previous fiscal year, with the left\nside indicating negative values and the right side indicating positive values.\n25\nW\nW\nW\nExpand Sales Channels to All Industries Through Initiatives to Attach Digital Content\nto Non-publication Products\nLet me explain the details of the graph. First, we have our NFT (non-fungible tokens)\nbusiness, FanTop, which utilizes blockchain technology, and has now achieved positive\noperating profit. Launched in October 2021, FanTop is just wrapping up its third year in\noperation.\nSo far, our solutions have primarily targeted the publishing industry. For example, when a\ncustomer buys a book, they receive a QR code. By scanning this code with their\nsmartphone, they can access NFTs and digital content related to the book. With over 2.57\nmillion copies issued, adoption by publishers continues to grow, and we plan to expand this\noffering further.\nAt the same time, we believe this technology has potential applications beyond publishing,\nand we are actively working to broaden its reach into a range of other industries.\n“ ” W\nand in August 2024, we replaced B-League game tickets for our sports business in\nTokushima with blockchain-based tickets. There are further details about this on the next\nslide.\n“ ”\nat approximately 60,000 convenience stores across Japan. We aim to roll out this initiative\nby the end of 2024.\n26\nWe have Implemented a World-first Initiative to Offer Video Content as Digital Tickets\nLet me explain Event Tickets (DCT) in more detail. For example, on FanTop, tickets for\nconcerts, sports events, and other events are managed as NFTs. While digital tickets that\nsimply convert paper tickets into digital formats are common, we aim to take it a step further\nby turning them into NFT items.\nHowever, converting tickets into NFT items only makes sense if they can be resold on the\n’\ntransform the ticket itself into digital content.\nFor instance, for the pro basketball team TOKUSHIMA GAMBAROUS, we could use videos\nof players taking shots or practicing. When the user clicks a button, a QR code is generated.\nBy scanning this QR code, the user can enter the event.\nUsually, event tickets are only used for entry and are then discarded. In contrast, our tickets\nwould allow users to watch and enjoy content—much like on YouTube—before the event.\nThe ticket serves as an entry pass, and after the game or concert, the user still retains the\ncontent and can continue to enjoy it.\n’\nspecial events by collecting certain content through secondary distribution. We believe NFT\nitems will increasingly be used for these kinds of purposes.\n’\nevents. For example, if a book costs 2,000 yen and the publisher prints 10,000 copies, while\n’ t 8,000 would be\nregular editions, with 2,000 coming with NFT items attached.\n27\nIn reality, only a small number of books come with NFT items, and not everyone who buys\nthem even downloads the NFT. However, with event tickets, unless the NFT ticket is\n’ —which is why their usage rates are significantly higher.\nThis slide features an exclusive event for TOKUSHIMA GAMBAROUS. We marketed the\nevent, and during it, video views increased significantly. Many people enjoyed the content as\nsoon as they received it, and we noticed that even after the event ended, the content\ncontinued to be replayed frequently.\nBuilding on this success, we plan to start with sports- ’\nto expand NFT usage to concert tickets and other events as well.\n28\nProgress Has Been Made in Measures for Both the Digital and Paper Sectors,\nand Business Performance Has Been on a Recovery Trend Since 2Q\nIn regard to NIHONBUNGEISHA, the company posted a considerable loss in the previous\n’\nstructure, and a new president took over in May 2024. The new president is making two\nmajor reforms.\nFirst, he is implementing reforms in the digital space, including how digital content is sold.\nSecond, he is making changes to everything from the printing to the distribution process for\nphysical books.\nOn the digital side, the new president, Hibiki Takemura, has done an excellent job building\n’\nwell-planned campaign, he was able to quickly increase the revenue of a particular title from\n35 million yen to 233 million yen.\n“\n”\ncompany is taking a more measured approach by adjusting print runs based on expected\nsales. For example, instead of printing 10,000 copies, we may reduce the print run to 8,000 if\n’\nimprove the actual sales rate.\nU ’\nprevious fiscal year through Q1 of this fiscal year, the company consistently posted large\nlosses. However, the reforms initiated at the end of last year are finally starting to pay off in\nQ2, with significant improvements compared to Q1.\n29\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nAt this point, we expect Q3 to show even further improvement, as indicated by the graph. By\nthe fourth quarter, we believe the company should be able to return to positive territory.\n30\nWe Have Started Developing a New Web Serialization Site to Expand the Recognition\nof Our Strong Content\n’ ’\nfocusing on promoting existing content, such as getting eBook stores to feature books and\nU W ’ ing various\nways to create new content.\nCurrently, NIHONBUNGEISHA is engaged in creating web pages and generating content\nfrom the web. However, the platforms that generate this content are scattered across\nmultiple sites. This has required managing several web pages separately, with individual\nsystems and people assigned to run different projects independently.\nThis is now being fully integrated. The plan is to launch a new website in March 2025 that\n’\nplatform. Our goal is to offer all works on this site free of charge to attract a large audience.\nWhat this means is that we will provide episode-based distribution free of charge, and this\n’\nsimilarly to weekly magazines, where the latest chapters are available to read for free each\nweek. This strategy is intended to attract a larger readership and grow our fan base.\nAs our fanbase and website traffic grow, we plan to expand our IP lineup from the current 20\ntitles per month to 25 or even 30.\nWe view the manga we create as intellectual property (IP). As our IP grows and gains\nreadership and popularity, we aim to adopt a multi-use approach by expanding into other\nW ’ e also\nconsidering translating this newly created content for distribution overseas.\n31\nW\nW\nU\nU\nAim to Increase Revenue by Increasing IP Creation from Our Novel Posting Site\nW “ ”\nNIHONBUNGEISHA, serves as an engine for IP creation.\n’\nof IPs we generate. Specifically, we are taking two key actions. First, we are enhancing our\nsupport system for original authors.\n’\nown dedicated staff member. These staff members identify promising novels submitted by\nthe public and pitch them to major publishers like Shueisha and Kodansha “\n?” “W ?”\n’\n’ “ ”\nReaders who enjoy a story can tip the author with a Star Gift.\nThis motivates authors to continue writing engaging stories, as the more their work is read,\nthe more their income increases. Since the launch of this system, submissions have\nincreased by 20%, suggesting the system has been highly effective.\nThe graph on the right side of the slide shows the growth in royalty income from our IP\ncreations. The orange represents royalty revenue, which we expect to grow from 143 million\nyen in the fiscal year ended February 2023 to an estimate of 225 million yen in the fiscal\nyear ending February 2025—an increase of about 50% over two years.\nWe also expect the number of works to increase from 231 titles in the fiscal year ending\nFebruary 2023 to 371 titles in the fiscal year ending February 2025—an additional 140 titles.\nThese works will be brought to life as content through Everystar.\n32\n“ ”\ncreated through Everystar. Not only was it published as a manga, but it was also adapted\ninto a movie, exemplifying the multi-use potential of our content. Once content is created, we\nbelieve it can be adapted into various forms, opening up opportunities for film, game, and\nother adaptations.\n33\nAim to Maximize IP Value by Promoting Multiple Use of Content\nW ’ ’\nalso engaged in the business of creating our own content.\nIn particular, we aim to generate IP through NIHONBUNGEISHA as a publisher and\nEverystar as a web-novel platform. Our goal is to expand the use of this IP across multiple\nformats— ’ -action, games,\nmerchandise, events, and fan communities moving forward.\n34\nAs the Overseas Comic Market Expands, the Need to Enter Overseas Markets is\nIncreasing, But Issues Also Arise\n’ —many Japanese publishers are considering taking their content global. In\n2023, the North American manga market was valued at around 140 billion yen, and by 2030,\n’ -fold to approximately 580 billion yen. In other words,\nJapanese content is poised to become a major global business.\nHowever, there are challenges when it comes to expanding content overseas, especially\n’\nchallenge is that procuring legitimate content for international distribution is not easy.\nThe second challenge is the lack of information about to whom to license rights and which\nchannels to use for distribution to drive sales. Business practices and languages differ\nsignificantly from those in Japan, making local expertise crucial for success in these\nmarkets.\n35\nThe MEDIA DO Group, as a Whole, Can Provide Support to Address the Issues\nInvolved in Entering Overseas Markets\n’\ncontent overseas for over seven years. Regarding the first challenge—procuring legitimate\ncontent—we are in a strong position, as we have contracts with all publishers handling\neBooks, ensuring that we can properly obtain and license official content.\nFor the second challenge, a lack of expertise in overseas distribution, our San Diego-based\ncompany, Media Do International, has been in the translation business for more than seven\nyears. Currently, we distribute approximately 16,000 translated titles globally through our\nplatforms, including those translated in-house and those handled by partner publishers. We\nplan to continue leveraging this expertise as we expand globally.\nW ’\n’\nanime, which is operated by one of our Group companies.\n“ -\n”\ndigital or print, reaches audiences worldwide, and we look forward to collaborating with\npublishers to make this happen.\n36\nNotice of the Publication of Integrated Report 2024\nWe are pleased to announce that our Integrated Report 2024, completed at the end of\nAugust and already distributed to stakeholders, marks our fifth edition.

Additionally, the operating deficit in the strategic investment businesses\ndecreased, mainly due to improved profitability in the IP solution business, resulting in increased revenues and profits. On the other hand,\nwe recorded an extraordinary loss related to the business liquidation of JIVE Ltd., our publishing subsidiary, which withdrew from the paper\nbook business to concentrate on the production and sales of eBooks.\nAs a result, net sales amounted to ¥51,057 million (up 10.0% year on year), operating profit totaled ¥1,096 million (up 10.4% year on\nyear), ordinary profit was ¥1,034 million (up 10.3% year on year) and profit attributable to owners of parent came to ¥521 million (up 2.2%\nyear on year), respectively, in the first six months of fiscal 2024.\nThe operating results of each segment during the first six months ended fiscal 2024, were as follows.\n(2) Segment information\neBook Distribution Business\nIn the eBook distribution business, the Group continued to provide eBook wholesale and distribution solutions to eBook retailers, including\nComic Cmoa and Amazon Kindle. The MEDIA DO Group contributes to the development of the publishing industry as the largest eBook\nwholesaler in Japan, with business relationships with more than 2,200 publishers and over 150 eBook retailers, handling more than 2.1\nmillion items of content, and conducting more than 17,000 campaigns in collaboration with publishers and eBook retailers annually (as of\nthe end of February 2024). In recent years, alongside the expansion of the eBook market, the amount of content and the number of campaigns\nhandled by publishers and eBook retailers have continued to increase due to the prevalence of various distribution formats, such as the\ndistribution of individual stories. This has led to a yearly increase in the operational costs related to the distribution of eBooks, highlighting\nthe increasing significance of eBook wholesalers. The Company aims to expand the eBook market itself and increase its distribution share\nby linking core systems, developing new systems in line with current trends, and providing detailed support based on its accumulated\nexpertise as a wholesaler. By doing so, we will contribute to the smooth distribution of eBooks, streamline operations between publishers\nand eBook retailers, and reduce the accident rate of distribution.\nDuring the first six months of fiscal 2024, the Company has returned to a growth trend again, with brisk sales from new sales channels\nacquired in February 2024 and existing sales channels. On the other hand, segment profit increased only slightly, mainly due to the decrease\nin the amount of engineer personnel expenses transferred to assets in progress.\n2\nConsequently, net sales in the eBook distribution segment were ¥47,130 million (up 10.1% year on year), and segment profit was ¥2,514\nmillion (up 0.1% year on year).\nStrategic Investment Businesses\nThe strategic investment businesses consist of four businesses: FanTop business, imprint business, IP solution business, global business.\nAs for the FanTop business, we aim to vitalize the publishing and content industries by attaching valuable NFT digital content with asset-\nlike qualities to paper books and distributing NFT digital content on the NFT marketplace, which we have developed and operate in-house.\nAs a result of our continued efforts to enhance our approach to magazines with large circulations, the total number of copies issued by the\nend of August 2024 exceeded 2.54 million, contributing to the sales growth of the publications. We have also made progress with initiatives\nfor non-publication products, such as the world’s first attempt to use special video content as digital content tickets (DCTs) at an event held\nin August 2024.\nAs for the imprint business, the Company aims to help further expand the content market by producing influential original works from\nthe publisher NIHONBUNGEISHA, and by collaborating with other publishers to novelize and adopt into comics the works posted to the\nweb-novel platform Everystar, as well as promoting multimedia conversions. In particular, NIHONBUNGEISHA saw an increase in sales\nof active content due to the strengthening of its eBook campaigns. Additionally, in terms of paper book publishing, efforts to improve the\nprofit structure through the optimization of the number of copies delivered have made progress. As a result, business performance bottomed\nout in the first quarter and has been improving since the second quarter. We will continue to promote various initiatives aiming for full-year\nprofitability from the next fiscal year and beyond.\nAs for the IP solution business, the Company aims to expand the domestic publishing market and capture synergistic earnings opportunities\nby offering a wide range of eBook-related services, spanning from publishers to consumers. Flier Inc., which provides book summarization\nservices, has developed a SaaS-type business model and has steadily expanded its customer base, with the cumulative number of corporate\ncontracts exceeding 1,000 companies. As a result, it turned a profit in July and August 2024 on a single-month basis. The operating deficit\nwas significantly reduced as a result of several factors, including sales from work commissioned by NTT DOCOMO, INC. for the launch of\nan electronic comic distribution service for overseas markets, increased sales from multiple hit titles provided to Audible in the audiobook\nbusiness, and a temporary impact from the withdrawal from the production of original works in the VSC (Vertical Scrolling Comic) business.\nAs for the global business, the Company provides DX services to European and U.S. publishers, including the five major U.S. publishers,\nwith a SaaS-type business model. In addition to building a network with European and U.S. publishers, the Company aims to transfer\noverseas publishing DX know-how to Japanese publishers in the future. The number of contracts with publishers, who are its customers, has\nbeen steadily increasing, and the churn rate of existing customers is low, ranging from 0% to 3%. As a result, revenue has been growing\nalongside the accumulation of corporate contracts. In North America, against the backdrop of the growing demand for Japanese content,\nmainly comics, the need for publishers and eBook retailers to enter overseas markets is expanding. We will aim to increase our revenue by\ncontinuing to actively support the distribution of content in overseas markets using our network and know-how.\nAs described above, in the strategic investment business during the six months ended August 31, 2024, the IP solution business, FanTop\nbusiness, and global business contributed to reduce the deficit. The imprint business saw a year on year decrease in profits because the full\neffect from improvements in the corporate structure at NIHONBUNGEISHA Co., Ltd. is expected to be seen from the second half of the\nyear, despite steady progress being made.\nConsequently, for the strategic investment businesses as, net sales totaled ¥3,861 million (up 7.7% year on year), with a segment loss of\n¥583 million (segment loss of ¥737 million in the same period of the previous year).\n(3) Explanation of financial position\nAs of August 31, 2024, total assets stood at 52,961 million yen, an increase of 1,349 million yen compared to the end of the previous\nfiscal year.

In the eBook distribution business, the Company will continue to provide high-quality services that meet the needs of\nits business partners and work closely with them, aiming to expand its market share and achieve business growth that exceeds the growth of\nthe eBook market. In the strategic investment businesses, the Company will focus its management resources on promising businesses to\ndrive growth, while also promoting a revitalization of its business portfolio through reassessment. These efforts are aimed at reducing deficits\nand achieving the full-year plan.\nAs of now, there is no change to the consolidated earnings forecast announced on April 11, 2024.\n4\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n(1) Consolidated balance sheets\n(Millions of yen)\nAs of February 29, 2024 As of August 31, 2024\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and deposits 11,004 12,237\nNotes and accounts receivable -
