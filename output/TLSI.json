We recently launched the TriNav LV system to address patients with larger vessels, an opportunity we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and provide full access to the $375 million liver embolization market.” \n\n“With the successful completion of our Phase 1 dose escalation study enrollment in UM-LM, we are actively pursuing a strategic partnership for nelitolimod,” continued Ms. Szela. “This follows the successful presentation of positive Phase 1 results from our PERIO-01 dose escalation study in UM-LM at SITC. Additionally, by mid-2025, we anticipate data from our Phase 1 study in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, which will guide our next steps.” \n\n“Our clinical development efforts for the TriNav system have expanded with the launch of the DELIVER program, starting with the PROTECT registry trial for patients with multinodular goiter. There is significant potential to broaden our addressable market by $400 million, and we are committed to providing further updates on PROTECT and additional programs within the DELIVER initiative.” \n\n“Finally, we are initiating 2025 guidance that calls for greater than 50% revenue growth, a greater than 20% reduction in operating expenses, positive full-year EBITDA, and positive cash flow in the second half of the year,” concluded Ms. Szela. \n\n**Third Quarter Business Update**\n\n_TriNav System Large Vessel Launch_\n\nTriSalus recently expanded its portfolio of Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD™) devices with the launch of the TriNav LV Infusion System and TriGuide Guiding Catheter to optimize therapeutic delivery for patients with larger vessels. The TriNav LV system is suitable for patients with vessels sized between 3.5 and 5.0 mm and is expected to allow the Company to meaningfully expand its addressable liver embolization market. The TriGuide Guiding Catheter has a larger inner diameter, lubricious inner lining, and reverse curve design to support femoral access for the TriNav LV system, which the Company believes will enhance procedural efficiency. These new products are eligible for the same HCPCS reimbursement codes as existing TriNav products, enabling seamless integration into current billing structures. \n\n_DELIVER and PROTECT Updates_\n\nDuring the quarter, TriSalus advanced the DELIVER clinical program, a series of clinical trials designed to demonstrate enhanced safety and efficacy across a broad spectrum of complex, difficult-to-treat patients through investigator-initiated studies, further underscoring the impact of PEDD technology. A key focus of the DELIVER program is to investigate the potential of combining use of the TriNav system with these therapies to enhance effectiveness and address resistance mechanisms in challenging cancers. \n\nThe first of these is a registry study called PROTECT (Pressure Enabled Retrograde Occlusive Therapy with Embolization for Control of Thyroid Disease), which has been initiated, and TriSalus intends to enroll 100 patients across five leading academic sites. It is estimated that approximately 5% of adults have multinodular goiters, and the prevalence in adults over 50 is estimated to be up to 50%. The Company estimates that this could expand the addressable market by approximately 50,000 procedures, representing an incremental $400 million market opportunity and putting the Company’s total addressable market at more than $1 billion in the U.S. This new procedure utilizing the TriNav system is also eligible for the same Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) reimbursement code allowing for seamless integration into current billing approaches. \n\nThe Company anticipates opening additional DELIVER studies in the first half of 2025 and will provide more details as those studies commence. \n\n_PERIO Trial Update_\n\nTriSalus presented Phase 1 results from the PERIO-01 clinical trial at the recent SITC meeting. This dose escalation trial investigated the use of the PEDD method of nelitolimod in patients with UM-LM. The results suggested that PEDD-administered nelitolimod, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, provides promising clinical benefits and durable survival in heavily pretreated patients with UM-LM and a favorable safety profile. The Company is actively exploring strategic partnerships to advance this indication further. \n\nThe Company also completed enrollment of 13 patients in its PERIO-03 Phase 1 dose escalation study of nelitolimod in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Evidence gathered thus far supports a strong safety profile and further exploration of nelitolimod combined with the TriNav pancreatic infusion technology. The Company will outline the next steps once the final data are available in mid-2025. \n\n**Financial Results for Q3 2024**\n\nRevenue, all from the sale of the TriNav system, was $7.3 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These were up 42% and 66%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased selling resources and increased market share. \n\nGross margins were 86% and 86% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 89% and 84%, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The year-to-date improvement is due to increased factory volumes and improved operational efficiency. \n\nOperating losses were $8.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to losses of $18.6 million and $40.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. These amounts include non-cash stock compensation and depreciation expenses of $1.6 million and $4.3 million for the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 and $0.4 million and $0.9 million for the same periods in 2023. Current year reductions in operating losses are due to increased sales, reduced general and administrative expenses due to non-recurrence of prior year costs related to becoming a public company, and reduced research and development spending associated with the ramp-down of clinical trial spending. \n\nNet losses available to common stockholders were $2.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to losses of $1.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Net losses in 2024 include non-cash related gains on change in fair value of various derivatives of $7.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of $17.1 million and $16.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.12 and $0.91, respectively, compared to $0.14 and $5.72 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nOn September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.3 million. The Company expects existing liquidity sources and $25 million of available capacity on the OrbiMed debt facility to provide sufficient cash runway throughout 2025. In addition, the company expects to be EBITDA positive for 2025 and achieve positive cash flow by the second half of 2025, extending total cash runway beyond 2025. \n\n**2025 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is providing guidance for 2025 for the first time, including: \n\n  * Sales are expected to grow by more than 50% in 2025, driven by further market share increases in the TriNav system, the commercial launch of the TriNav LV system, and the TriNav target market expansion driven by the DELIVER program. \n  * Operating expenses are expected to decline greater than 20% in 2025 due to reductions in R&D associated with completing the PERIO Phase 1 trials and reductions in G&A expenses due to the non-recurrence of certain costs related to becoming a public Company. \n  * The Company expects to achieve positive full-year EBITDA and positive cash flow in the second half of the year. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nTriSalus will host a webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business highlights on November 14,2024, at 9:00 a.m. EST.

The Company’s platform includes devices that utilize a proprietary drug delivery technology and a clinical stage investigational immunotherapy. The Company’s two FDA-cleared devices use its proprietary Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD) approach to deliver a range of therapeutics: the TriNav® Infusion System for hepatic arterial infusion of liver tumors and the Pancreatic Retrograde Venous Infusion System for pancreatic tumors. The PEDD technology is a novel delivery approach designed to address the anatomic limitations of arterial infusion for the pancreas. The PEDD approach modulates pressure and flow in a manner that delivers more therapeutic to the tumor and is designed to reduce undesired delivery to normal tissue, bringing the potential to improve patient outcomes. Nelitolimod, the Company’s investigational immunotherapeutic candidate, is designed to improve patient outcomes by treating the immunosuppressive environment created by many tumors and which can make current immunotherapies ineffective in the liver and pancreas. Patient data generated during Pressure-Enabled Regional Immuno-Oncology™ (PERIO) clinical trials support the hypothesis that nelitolimod delivered via the PEDD technology may have favorable immune effects within the liver and systemically. The target for nelitolimod, TLR9, is expressed across cancer types and the mechanical barriers addressed by the PEDD technology are commonly present as well. \n\nIn partnership with leading cancer centers across the country – and by leveraging deep immuno-oncology expertise and inventive technology development – TriSalus is committed to advancing innovation that improves outcomes for patients.

We recently launched the TriNav LV system to address patients with larger vessels, an opportunity we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and provide full access to the $375 million liver embolization market.” \n\n“With the successful completion of our Phase 1 dose escalation study enrollment in UM-LM, we are actively pursuing a strategic partnership for nelitolimod,” continued Ms. Szela. “This follows the successful presentation of positive Phase 1 results from our PERIO-01 dose escalation study in UM-LM at SITC. Additionally, by mid-2025, we anticipate data from our Phase 1 study in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, which will guide our next steps.” \n\n“Our clinical development efforts for the TriNav system have expanded with the launch of the DELIVER program, starting with the PROTECT registry trial for patients with multinodular goiter. There is significant potential to broaden our addressable market by $400 million, and we are committed to providing further updates on PROTECT and additional programs within the DELIVER initiative.” \n\n“Finally, we are initiating 2025 guidance that calls for greater than 50% revenue growth, a greater than 20% reduction in operating expenses, positive full-year EBITDA, and positive cash flow in the second half of the year,” concluded Ms. Szela. \n\n**Third Quarter Business Update**\n\n_TriNav System Large Vessel Launch_\n\nTriSalus recently expanded its portfolio of Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD™) devices with the launch of the TriNav LV Infusion System and TriGuide Guiding Catheter to optimize therapeutic delivery for patients with larger vessels. The TriNav LV system is suitable for patients with vessels sized between 3.5 and 5.0 mm and is expected to allow the Company to meaningfully expand its addressable liver embolization market. The TriGuide Guiding Catheter has a larger inner diameter, lubricious inner lining, and reverse curve design to support femoral access for the TriNav LV system, which the Company believes will enhance procedural efficiency. These new products are eligible for the same HCPCS reimbursement codes as existing TriNav products, enabling seamless integration into current billing structures. \n\n_DELIVER and PROTECT Updates_\n\nDuring the quarter, TriSalus advanced the DELIVER clinical program, a series of clinical trials designed to demonstrate enhanced safety and efficacy across a broad spectrum of complex, difficult-to-treat patients through investigator-initiated studies, further underscoring the impact of PEDD technology. A key focus of the DELIVER program is to investigate the potential of combining use of the TriNav system with these therapies to enhance effectiveness and address resistance mechanisms in challenging cancers. \n\nThe first of these is a registry study called PROTECT (Pressure Enabled Retrograde Occlusive Therapy with Embolization for Control of Thyroid Disease), which has been initiated, and TriSalus intends to enroll 100 patients across five leading academic sites. It is estimated that approximately 5% of adults have multinodular goiters, and the prevalence in adults over 50 is estimated to be up to 50%. The Company estimates that this could expand the addressable market by approximately 50,000 procedures, representing an incremental $400 million market opportunity and putting the Company’s total addressable market at more than $1 billion in the U.S. This new procedure utilizing the TriNav system is also eligible for the same Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) reimbursement code allowing for seamless integration into current billing approaches. \n\nThe Company anticipates opening additional DELIVER studies in the first half of 2025 and will provide more details as those studies commence. \n\n_PERIO Trial Update_\n\nTriSalus presented Phase 1 results from the PERIO-01 clinical trial at the recent SITC meeting. This dose escalation trial investigated the use of the PEDD method of nelitolimod in patients with UM-LM. The results suggested that PEDD-administered nelitolimod, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, provides promising clinical benefits and durable survival in heavily pretreated patients with UM-LM and a favorable safety profile. The Company is actively exploring strategic partnerships to advance this indication further. \n\nThe Company also completed enrollment of 13 patients in its PERIO-03 Phase 1 dose escalation study of nelitolimod in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Evidence gathered thus far supports a strong safety profile and further exploration of nelitolimod combined with the TriNav pancreatic infusion technology. The Company will outline the next steps once the final data are available in mid-2025. \n\n**Financial Results for Q3 2024**\n\nRevenue, all from the sale of the TriNav system, was $7.3 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These were up 42% and 66%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased selling resources and increased market share. \n\nGross margins were 86% and 86% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 89% and 84%, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The year-to-date improvement is due to increased factory volumes and improved operational efficiency. \n\nOperating losses were $8.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to losses of $18.6 million and $40.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. These amounts include non-cash stock compensation and depreciation expenses of $1.6 million and $4.3 million for the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 and $0.4 million and $0.9 million for the same periods in 2023. Current year reductions in operating losses are due to increased sales, reduced general and administrative expenses due to non-recurrence of prior year costs related to becoming a public company, and reduced research and development spending associated with the ramp-down of clinical trial spending. \n\nNet losses available to common stockholders were $2.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to losses of $1.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Net losses in 2024 include non-cash related gains on change in fair value of various derivatives of $7.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of $17.1 million and $16.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.12 and $0.91, respectively, compared to $0.14 and $5.72 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nOn September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.3 million. The Company expects existing liquidity sources and $25 million of available capacity on the OrbiMed debt facility to provide sufficient cash runway throughout 2025. In addition, the company expects to be EBITDA positive for 2025 and achieve positive cash flow by the second half of 2025, extending total cash runway beyond 2025. \n\n**2025 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is providing guidance for 2025 for the first time, including: \n\n  * Sales are expected to grow by more than 50% in 2025, driven by further market share increases in the TriNav system, the commercial launch of the TriNav LV system, and the TriNav target market expansion driven by the DELIVER program. \n  * Operating expenses are expected to decline greater than 20% in 2025 due to reductions in R&D associated with completing the PERIO Phase 1 trials and reductions in G&A expenses due to the non-recurrence of certain costs related to becoming a public Company. \n  * The Company expects to achieve positive full-year EBITDA and positive cash flow in the second half of the year. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nTriSalus will host a webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business highlights on November 14,2024, at 9:00 a.m. EST.

The Company’s platform includes devices that utilize a proprietary drug delivery technology and a clinical stage investigational immunotherapy. The Company’s two FDA-cleared devices use its proprietary Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD) approach to deliver a range of therapeutics: the TriNav® Infusion System for hepatic arterial infusion of liver tumors and the Pancreatic Retrograde Venous Infusion System for pancreatic tumors. The PEDD technology is a novel delivery approach designed to address the anatomic limitations of arterial infusion for the pancreas. The PEDD approach modulates pressure and flow in a manner that delivers more therapeutic to the tumor and is designed to reduce undesired delivery to normal tissue, bringing the potential to improve patient outcomes. Nelitolimod, the Company’s investigational immunotherapeutic candidate, is designed to improve patient outcomes by treating the immunosuppressive environment created by many tumors and which can make current immunotherapies ineffective in the liver and pancreas. Patient data generated during Pressure-Enabled Regional Immuno-Oncology™ (PERIO) clinical trials support the hypothesis that nelitolimod delivered via the PEDD technology may have favorable immune effects within the liver and systemically. The target for nelitolimod, TLR9, is expressed across cancer types and the mechanical barriers addressed by the PEDD technology are commonly present as well. \n\nIn partnership with leading cancer centers across the country – and by leveraging deep immuno-oncology expertise and inventive technology development – TriSalus is committed to advancing innovation that improves outcomes for patients.
